Apple,iPhone 12,bro it overheated when playing games other all is good and it doesnt catch network fast
Apple,iPhone 12,who still has this phone
Apple,iPhone 12,is this very nice and very beautiful
Apple,iPhone 12,super
Apple,iPhone 12,so ive been using the iphone for quite few months now much like you had been an andr more totaly agree with your comment currently have the iphone blue brand new from powermac store here in the philippines but before both second hand but the reason buy again the same iphone is the availability and the price ofcaurce but recommend that you better buy brand new and from sealed item be sure its legit because when purchase again the same iphone wich have use right now im totaly satisfied the screen from boddy to racio the color and the slim iphone very cutesy very demure love it the second hand iphone in the other hand did sell it for low price my gosh dont buy iphone from person its bogus not legit you just waiting money
Apple,iPhone 12,regarding the battery life and charging section one trick ive found incredibly useful is using battery limiter its gamechanger for maintaining longterm battery health combined this with apples optimized battery charging feature which learns your daily routine and delays charging past until you need it this duo has really helped me keep my battery health stable anyone else tried battery limiter or have other batterysaving tips especially with the iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,this iphone is the best iphone have an iphone plus but am happy with it it works great and is very addictive you have to be happy with what you have but also when you have
Apple,iPhone 12,make sure you get original product never experienced any of the issues you stated or bette more plus is good this is the funniest joke have ever seen am currently using it and guess what the processor is very hot the frame is not antislip and difficult to hold and the waterproof effect is very poor compared to the claims dont know how many times it has been repaired but all in all its not worth the price at all
Apple,iPhone 12,phone is behaving quite erratically was using phone and now in one yea more buy an pro max everything except the chip is better than the best iphone currently
Apple,iPhone 12,first off all comming from android miss the back button on iphone apps are pain in the ass to find no customization in ios like launchers etc the only pros are the quality cameras fast face id and secure os you cant install any apps outside store its more secure than android because even if you click on any unknown links from whatsapp they cant hack ur iphone battery life sucks in iphone year guess will switch to iphone when it comes out is good but have noticed better cell coverage in androids no auto filling of otps in iphones headphones are expensive and android phones have better settings options can find stuff easily
Apple,iPhone 12,price has gotten too low now but after looking at battery endurance nah iphone are generally equipped with weak batteries
Apple,iPhone 12,purchased phone in the os failed within week got replacement of hardware without any charge now working fine
Apple,iPhone 12,years on android now im thinking of buying this phone its just android skins slapped on every phone are getting usedto and boring someone just confirm me the battery timing of this phone im an android user who loves the mah figure and ive no idea about this under mah phone so id love comments from those who experienced this phone
Apple,iPhone 12,you can tell if phone manufacturer takes care of their customers or not by what they happen more and what about taking care of the planet how many people buying these phones dont already have chargers etc if not and in the uk ask on freegle where youll get all the accessories you need for free
Apple,iPhone 12,have this device and love it the face id with mask on can be finicky at times but otherwise have no issues with it
Apple,iPhone 12,need it free is good
Apple,iPhone 12,hate it total piece of crap now see why they were buy one get one free no home butt more you really are unreasonable next will be the iphone bet the battery life will be just as good but im fine with no home button so why dont you just shut up and move on
Apple,iPhone 12,feeling very bad about its water resistance have used the same hand with phone to open tap and the water have flowed on the phone and its dead your water resistance is very bad compared to other mobiles the water have just entered on the mobile and its got damaged and for replacement with warrenty you have charged half of the new pro max price swear this is my last iphone and iam not gonna recommend anyone to buy more worthless mobile feeling pitty for it
Apple,iPhone 12,this apple iphone works outstandingly well
Apple,iPhone 12,how is not having official raw support not massive con it really sickens me that tech phone site refuses to call out apple on this bs artificial restriction imposed on the two base models on the android end you can take china junk phone slap gcam over it and if the sensor is at least of some decent sony make it can output raws that can be tinkered with later or fiddled with to create hdrs images but this phone lineup does not support raws unless you use paid rd party apps and even then those do not leverage the entire hardware kits features this point literally keeps me who is brand loyal only to my own wallet and needs from plonking on nonpro iphone or since apple is just so gd greedy with their tactics and before spend on pro model would rather pick up cheap pizel for calyxos and budget dslr and have the best of both worlds
Apple,iPhone 12,having iphone pro mac huawei pro samsung note feel that battery camera and variety app of android are all fall better then iphone the only thing chose iphone pro max now is only the securitys and privacy provide by apple feel more secure on the app download from apple store rather the google store the latest privacy control also add point for me to chose iphone pro max as do online transactions through phone other then that dun see any advantage iphone over android phone used
Apple,iPhone 12,the photos look natural not at all the daylight photos use watercolor noise reduction
Apple,iPhone 12,insanely better resolution oled uses subpixels vs lcds that means in reality more held my next to an screen is in another league the resolution seems like something out of and the lcd though it is very good for an lcd is lacking in colors and blacks
Apple,iPhone 12,love it
Apple,iPhone 12,well it is professionals dont have time to configure root flash change icon packs or what more looks like to most of the gsmarena readers pro means who uses hisher phone to shoot and edit videos uploads in youtube or who tweaks his os root it and install custom roms nonetheless these group doesnt have much else to do the definition of real pro is not the same as the definition of pro coined by gsmarena readers
Apple,iPhone 12,the xxsxs max were the first phones they made with an oled screen which has insanely bette more insanely better resolution oled uses subpixels vs lcds that means in reality both have kinda same resolution iphone display is very good apart from your so called low resolution even if you think ppi oled wins vs ppi lcd the color reproduction contrast all are very good and not to say welcome to flickering great lcd is as good as great oled
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone bought this swanky gadget last week and much to me delight im enjoying every moment of itextra ordinary touch magnificent camera excellent battery backupwhat nottruly premium experiencejust go for this master piece
Apple,iPhone 12,when will iphones have inbuilt dual app facility not using rd party apps iphone is concerned about privacy but allows rd party apps for using dual apps why cant they develop inbuilt feature for dual apps
Apple,iPhone 12,bought iphone days ago th jun and found display flickering issue with the mobile more oleds dont even look that bad but the pwm has yet to be the problem for your iphone screen especially in low brightness of course the ltpo oled was by far the best display that samsung has ever made even though it flickers its still the best
Apple,iPhone 12,its so fabulous and enticing to buy
Apple,iPhone 12,so many embarrassing droid fanboys here jeez you guys are cringy stick with your mah more you do know that iphone has parts from china and assembly is in china also the microchip is from taiwan or korea get over it iphone is gimmick and your comment about china phone is bullet to your own foot since iphone only is designed in the states lol
Apple,iPhone 12,this phone sucks it does whatever it wants and whenever it wants am medical worker and more you need to turn sleep mode off sleep mode silences the call during sleep timings
Apple,iPhone 12,but mine working perfectly are sure bought the original are you sure that is original iphone it sound like you are using imitation or something you always can bring it back to any authorised apple sc and they will check for you even replace with new phone
Apple,iPhone 12,having the ip for almost mths went and checked out the in the flesh yesterday so ove more the xxsxs max were the first phones they made with an oled screen which has insanely better resolution than lcd they used lcd again for the less expensive xr phone and for some reason kept lcd for the iphone they upgraded back to oled with the pro beyond this is further reason why apple sucks as company but my point is has better screen than iphone even though it was made earlier
Apple,iPhone 12,bought this phone with big smile but iphone sucks nobody can hear me but can hear them more but mine working perfectly are sure bought the original
Apple,iPhone 12,buy
Apple,iPhone 12,awesome phone with class leading camera and processor apple leads and the industry follows one billion iphone owners cant be wrong the only choice is between the and the pro either way its great piece of technology
Apple,iPhone 12,how did you get for hdfc cashback and store discount
Apple,iPhone 12,go the gb iphone for got an apple watch as wellhave always used android flagship more how did you get for
Apple,iPhone 12,my iphone pros camera is on the normal mode how do change it to the photo mode bec more open your camera swipe to portrait then youll see on your right hand top corner when you press it will appear on you left lower hand then press it again you will then see the new features then pick number counting from your left to your right press it there you have your features
Apple,iPhone 12,would say no if you want to buy iphone have been an android user for the past yea more go the gb iphone for got an apple watch as wellhave always used android flagships in the past note plusgalaxy plusgalaxy galaxy sgalaxy note galaxy android flagships are becoming bulky this phone is right size and weight enjoying the usage initially was apprehensive on switching to ios but not missing android that much only missing the telephoto cam battery life is excellent not close to note plus camera is better than note plus except for absence of telephoto find color accuracy to be better find ios refined and much better in security fed up of ads in android better updates got lighting cable as gift along with the phone using it with old chargers apple should have give an option for charging brick apple is indeed expensive in india samsung is also going the apple route so willing to put equivalent money on apple anyday my apple watch went into bootloop after days service center prompotly replaced it with new one am neither an apple or samsung fanboy just want to buy the best device as per my budget and usage
Apple,iPhone 12,yes agree though skipped cooling again had some graphite layers right under the mo more do you really think small layer would make any difference in typical usage in smartphone the cooling stuff for smartphone is more of marketing than actual benefit unless you continuously use the the device without closing for like hrs lol
Apple,iPhone 12,am switching from android to apple productsi have dollars budget and need device fo more why are you doing this for bucks you could have choses better value from one of midhighrange androids though
Apple,iPhone 12,my friendno its not iphone has better camera iphone beat pro even in more its not really the camera but its more about software
Apple,iPhone 12,first of all will suggest you to buy an iphone there are lots of advantage of buying ipho more sounds like terrible choices
Apple,iPhone 12,can someone please which one will long last with more usage iphone or ipad pro whichever you use less will last longer
Apple,iPhone 12,if im looking between the iphone and samsung which is better mostly go for th more they both suck for the price
Apple,iPhone 12,very nice phone
Apple,iPhone 12,what is it with apple not removing that age old ugly notch face id since it needs the depth sensor and stuff most phones use face unlock from the front camera which is not safe because picture of you can easily unlock the phone they should do something about it with the next models though
Apple,iPhone 12,just saved up and was thinking of upgrading but dont know what to do currently have an iphone and was thinking of switching to the or pro dont use the camera that much
Apple,iPhone 12,very good apple
Apple,iPhone 12,no it didnt beat pro pro annihilates the iphone pro when you turn auto hdr more noi watched on tv
Apple,iPhone 12,who told you oneplus has best camera its using last years imx iphone more my friendno its not iphone has better camera iphone beat pro even in night mode please search this on youtube have the proand am witching on iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,tool of choice for the pros lol good joke well it is professionals dont have time to configure root flash change icon packs or whatever it is you do the definition of professional is someone who is paid to do something not confused boys who play with hello kitty icon packs and wear ballerina skirt while doing so no matter how advanced stuff they do they are by definition amateurs ie noone will pay you for your useless skills plus there are already million of you not earning anything from your youtube channels
Apple,iPhone 12,was surprised that my telecom provider gave me pd charger for free and gb version at price of gb version very nice bad news is that cannot install yt app only in chrome can watch hd videos
Apple,iPhone 12,this is total waste of money ive been to apple in past years and regret it its total waste of money plus their warranty sucks and no charger and not repairable
Apple,iPhone 12,the picture that captured is completely different when look on my albums it was perfect while taking but the picture turning quite different more like oily effectcould you please help me how to change that
Apple,iPhone 12,oh if blatant misinformation tickles your pickle your gonna have field day on the gsmarena more tool of choice for the pros lol good joke
Apple,iPhone 12,it wont scratch glass androids camera glass its not actually real sapphire
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone has only been released and you know that most pro photographers own it what blatant more oh if blatant misinformation tickles your pickle your gonna have field day on the gsmarena comments sections your right though guess meant it in that iphones are normally the tool of choice for pros highly doubt that will change this year whilst we are on the subject of the having just been released see number of people on here drawing all kinds of conclusions they no way could have could have properly tested yet seems that doesnt bother you so much though
Apple,iPhone 12,and yet for some reason its the device youll find in the possession of most pro photographer more iphone has only been released and you know that most pro photographers own it what blatant misinformation
Apple,iPhone 12,watch techtablets vs opt vs miu camera video comparison beat the opt more who told you oneplus has best camera its using last years imx iphone is behind the major quality camera smartphones like find pro oneplus pro mi ultra huawei pro huawei mate galaxy etc its even behind pixel in lot of cases
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone pics from and series are all behind the quality of other flagships watch techtablets vs opt vs miu camera video comparison beat the opt in almost department and comes close to the miu in some aspects its camera quality is solid it also beats the pixel in some areas according to xda developers
Apple,iPhone 12,yeah ive heard about that my friends got them and his are being recalled theyll only do th more lets see how it pans out im also waiting for gsmas pro review and as told you anything can be in the pro max as its larger phone and hasnt been released assuming its also the only model with upgraded cameras dont expect much from the mini think im quite happy with my except the display and some occassional bugs
Apple,iPhone 12,most likely gonna need software update to improve upon lot of it pro max probably wont more yes agree though skipped cooling again had some graphite layers right under the motherboard so sustained performance is actually not bad by the way airpods pro has faced huge recall so lets see if ever gets recalled as well
Apple,iPhone 12,ugly nasty huge big notch and ugly curve design
Apple,iPhone 12,am sorry just look at photos and videos from gsmarena you must be blind to tell otherwise more iphone pics from and series are all behind the quality of other flagships
Apple,iPhone 12,you have anything to back up that rather dubious statement am sorry just look at photos and videos from gsmarena you must be blind to tell otherwise if not anything else details are better on httpsmgsmarenacompiccmpphpidtypeidphoneidphone httpsmgsmarenacomvidcmpphpidtypeidphoneidphone

Apple,iPhone 12,hi guys may ask if buying secondhand iphone good if so what are its pros and cons thanks check battery healtscreen most of the time they replacing with cheap ips or bad oled panel face id loudspeekers
Apple,iPhone 12,bought my off of amazon renewed and it has battery capacity couldnt believe more iphone the best wither we like or we dont and this coming from previous samsung fanboyuser even before android yeah know about that the mah battrey of iphone is excellent if its at even though if its still perform really well did some research about those big capacity battrey of iphone and realized that batterys are bad after month of use cause those batterys has pragrant issue of fake phones battreys lol
Apple,iPhone 12,for the people complening about battrey life of the iphone theres mahmah ava more bought my off of amazon renewed and it has battery capacity couldnt believe it its practically new phone it lasts me all day and then some came to work with charge and after hour shift where ive used it quite bit for web surfing music streaming social media and messaging apps still have left im not big apple fan but love the because its small light weight still powerful and still gets the latest ios updates this phone still holds up after over years heck even the iphone still holds up so many vloggers on youtube swear by the and still use it as their daily driver
Apple,iPhone 12,would choose this over an iphone any day just because of the bezels its only like bucks more than the and its alot better
Apple,iPhone 12,update my iphone to ios and so far no major issues except have noticed occasionall more if you are looking forward to gift it to someone kindly dont look any further im here thanks in advance
Apple,iPhone 12,the guy who said he had both and promax kindly gimme one pretty please
Apple,iPhone 12,is good enough little newer too thinner bezels albeit still bigger than average so more have them both from new and can tell for sure that iphone pro max its just way better battery last twice and the screen its way more bigger
Apple,iPhone 12,contemplating about buying my first ever ios device its either buying iphone or an more is good enough little newer too thinner bezels albeit still bigger than average so is good choice
Apple,iPhone 12,is with buying now new to much want as second device
Apple,iPhone 12,dirt cheap for iphones still supported in
Apple,iPhone 12,get yall its in your budget
Apple,iPhone 12,for some reason the gb version is little bit more expensive than the iphone still more go for the gb if possible gb
Apple,iPhone 12,greetings users im planning to buy an iphone gb in either red blue or purple more why bother get new se coming up better chip battery
Apple,iPhone 12,its fone
Apple,iPhone 12,ordered refurbished one this will be my first iphone ever looking forward to the experience will keep updated
Apple,iPhone 12,no never faced such issue but since ios update have almost damaged my ear while trying more seems like the face unlock works alright again dont know why it didnt work well perhaps it wasnt software issue at all am not sure if there was another software update in the meantime that might have fixed the issue
Apple,iPhone 12,anyone facing pun intended issues with face id after the update seems like its more no never faced such issue but since ios update have almost damaged my ear while trying to shift voice from speaker to ear piece trying to listen whatsapp voice messages privately but its proximity sensor picks up late and initially loud sound goes in your ear before it shifts to earpiece level sound and this issue was not there previously till ios dont know why the have changed sensitivity of proximity sensor
Apple,iPhone 12,go for gb at least cause iphone is good enough to be smooth and still good support softw more for some reason the gb version is little bit more expensive than the iphone still havent decided but am leaning more towards iphone even though the price difference is around am planning to use the phone in the next years and am kinda worried that the gb wont be enough
Apple,iPhone 12,is it still worth it to get new iphone with gb would prefer an iphone but the pri more go for gb at least cause iphone is good enough to be smooth and still good support software wise save your couple hundred bucks for something else and get iphone thats what id do
Apple,iPhone 12,mah battery capacity prefer mah battery phonesregardless of the brand if you get good mid range phone and install an apple ios launcher you feel exactly like the iphone users the advantage is the simplicity of ios but performance most midrange phones can challenge iphone and
Apple,iPhone 12,installed ios on my iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,hey have two options pro and which should go for pro for sure
Apple,iPhone 12,yeah it is still worth it hey have two options pro and which should go for
Apple,iPhone 12,battery too weak might need to replace battery been using my android lot since this phone drain out too fast plus not supported with xreal glasses
Apple,iPhone 12,how can you even comapre with the rest of samsung thats your fault do research bef more agree picked model not so models are not hard especially samsung one ui will be on par with apple
Apple,iPhone 12,had them booth from new iphone holds way more battery due to led screen regret replacin more iphone and has front camera iphone is better than in many ways even the battery outlasted my wifes anyone looking for darn cheap alternative to ios get not
Apple,iPhone 12,why will you switch to android back that insane dam iphone beats all around but hey that was your choice
Apple,iPhone 12,didnt get ios but ios today during the option of upgrade down at the button should be so you being offered but you have the option to upgrade to then or just upgrade to which said above that the upgrade to is beneath the upgrade
Apple,iPhone 12,very terrible gaming performance to all mobile gamers out there iphone had better performance than android theres barely any lags compared to android you just hard core gamer on phone buy console
Apple,iPhone 12,people complaining about its battery not lasting but yall remember when phones had mah battery or mah have zero battery problem and bet those complaining were android users some people still use iphone or plus and and they have good experience on battery id say people complaining are either picky or just saying too much
Apple,iPhone 12,is this still worth buying in yeah it is still worth it
Apple,iPhone 12,updated in iphone and earpiece speaker not working just clean ear speakers
Apple,iPhone 12,after ios on the iphone last month updated to ios recently it works fine and sm more updated in iphone and earpiece speaker not working
Apple,iPhone 12,what defines new here would an iphone for example not heat up as much because it has more love iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,what update should go with ios or ios recently purchased an iphone with ios more after ios on the iphone last month updated to ios recently it works fine and smooth dont notice much of difference in battery life though do experience some bugs the iphone is not my daily driver so its not that much bothering me but perhaps for you its better to wait for ios
Apple,iPhone 12,have been using since and the battery health held up pretty well after whole yea more what defines new here would an iphone for example not heat up as much because it has metal back
Apple,iPhone 12,passed out while reading that you should
Apple,iPhone 12,why do you feel lost fairly easy explain vs iphone dialer messaging apps same yes youre somewhat right but meant the operating system believe it is more logical and organized in ios than android system
Apple,iPhone 12,lost my mind and now its time to get my mind back again had an iphone everythi more how can you even comapre with the rest of samsung thats your fault do research before you buy the series are way better going back to iphone is waste of money as well since all the features iphone has come out with samsung already had
Apple,iPhone 12,im already stuck with android what want now is to escape from this operating system more why do you feel lost fairly easy explain vs iphone dialer messaging apps same
Apple,iPhone 12,just want to ask whether it is worth my money to upgrade from my iphone that is now on battery health to used iphone that is battery health are there any major differences especially on battery heard rumors that iphone drains faster than the but on youtube big content creators shows that iphone is way more battery efficient and shows more screen on time than the hope you answer my question
Apple,iPhone 12,hello everyone was very much in doubt weather to update my iphone to or not even more passed out while reading that
Apple,iPhone 12,thats true now the iphone battery life is like less than ish hours and thats without gaming on it oh yea have fun trying to game on this phone anymore
Apple,iPhone 12,bought used iphone for my friends with batt healthits original in settings more they just change the battery health to they just reprogram your phone in the philippines its usual case so be careful in buying nd hand phone
Apple,iPhone 12,hello fellows what feedback could give between the iphone and galaxy standard model comparison ive searched on the internet but couldnt find anything explicit
Apple,iPhone 12,need your help im planing to buy iphonethere are two choices of mine iphone pro ma more chose the iphone for several reasons smaller size at least perfect for me newer processor and it will get more updates pro max will get ios as the last major software update iphone will get ios and maybe also by large percentage get ios the camera offers very satisfactory performance for me my personal opinion is definitely and think its phone that deserves to be placed on your priority list wish you success in your choice
Apple,iPhone 12,buy the iphone gb and thank me later got it days ago and its my first iphone more in fact your response to my question is very late but have to thank you in any case for your interest in the response in any case already got the iphone can say with certainty that it is really great phone even for the battery its performance is very good considering that am not gaming fan but guess what im starting to get bored because always like to change im currently thinking about samsung care about your opinion
Apple,iPhone 12,phone is chunky thanks to side flat felt more comfortable holding huawei even it is thicker and larger bezels
Apple,iPhone 12,more software update thats the great thing for this older model when iphone xr gets os upgrades this should also get upgrades to ios
Apple,iPhone 12,the iphone is sure to get ios and and given that the iphone xr and xs will get an ad more more software update thats the great thing for this older model
Apple,iPhone 12,how many software updates left for this phone planning to buy the iphone is sure to get ios and and given that the iphone xr and xs will get an additional ios update it is very likely that the iphone will get ios
Apple,iPhone 12,had huawei ppro before bought my iphone do like the iphone series my only th more think you should have waited for the ip se like good boy
Apple,iPhone 12,please can the prices of the phones be reduced we wanna use but cant afford
Apple,iPhone 12,hey guys can you please suggest me which one to buy iphone or iphone am an android more hello if its for reliability and budget an iphone direct isnt very useful at the moment and the one on the is pretty inefficient like the one on the pixel pro recently downgraded to an iphone plus because my mini was suffering from serious connection problems and significant drop in battery life even in standby mode had heard that the had other problems if you want oled id recommend an pro still has long way to go in my country is still present but in some countries it has disappeared secondly software updates are kind of absurdity for me for those who want to keep their phone longer according to some people you have to go for iphone which is logical but with all its problems id avoid it would concentrate more on an older model or little more recent such as the
Apple,iPhone 12,thinking about getting this phone is it still worth it to get or is it better to go for the more go for or get the or
Apple,iPhone 12,need to take really great pictures selfies too would it be better for me to get the or more camera is nice but lacks detail as soon as you zoom in its clearly visible that image is very soft have this only complaint from the camera otherwise color caliberation whitebalance dynamic range everything is great would suggest to get one of the pixel if you want good detailed images or older galaxy with decent megapixel count
Apple,iPhone 12,if understood you correctly yes get one this phone has not good reputation athough it is more thankyou
Apple,iPhone 12,thinking of getting one from neo yay or nay even for the battery it is not as bad as some are talking about we can say its about above average battery but it is important that the battery health is not less than
Apple,iPhone 12,this is your opinion and respect it for sure but for me the iphone is choice of more more thinking of getting one from neo yay or nay
Apple,iPhone 12,dont think its good phone this is your opinion and respect it for sure but for me the iphone is choice of more than excellent even the battery is not that bad at all charge it once every hours given that am not game enthusiast this is good thing
Apple,iPhone 12,just avoid buying new phone altogether amoleds have far less battery life unless everyth more the last lcd based phone know is iphone honestly with hdr certification prefer lcds
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone pro vs which is the best overall camera battery currently both used pric more camera performance is pretty much the same apart from that extra lens not sure about the battery would choose ip just because it weights way less so its nicer to use and carry
Apple,iPhone 12,somebody buy me phone pls

Apple,iPhone 12,well the has more possibilities feature wise but if you are used to iphone and your more thank you so much my bro already got iphone its really nice phone

Apple,iPhone 12,there is my friend what about the left over stocks in shelf and the refurbished ones from app more mean gsmarena should write it like discontinued available or similar terms even the nexbit robin from are also written available im not an apple fan but pretty much appreciate steve jobs more than my president
Apple,iPhone 12,available released october wtf iphone had been discontinued few more there is my friend what about the left over stocks in shelf and the refurbished ones from apple and other rd party sellers even old and above models available as refurbished or in mint condition kept by the owner as vintage so apple iphone is successful tech introduced by steve jobs his company as his legacy will be there in our hands as reminder of his honor
Apple,iPhone 12,sfe is an oven toaster why
Apple,iPhone 12,nop dont go for iphone instead buy iphone for better battery life than the bionic bionic iphone will get more updates iphone has better screen build quality iphone has
Apple,iPhone 12,just bought it today and it performs superbly ill update once run up to some issues more damn cant believe people still use this but im glad ive had mine for years now
Apple,iPhone 12,well just got the today and must say first impressions it looks more durable than pm more the iphone is wonderful better than the entire iphone lineup so yeah an oled screen
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone or pm well just got the today and must say first impressions it looks more durable than pm havent used it well enough to comment about the battery life tho
Apple,iPhone 12,its very sad that this is still the lightest inch iphone and that newer models are heavier the successors are and grams respectively and the iphone is rumored to be the best feeling iphone ever was the iphone and it weighed just grams
Apple,iPhone 12,need an adviceim literally using the iphone xs max and want to upgrade to the is it or be more if you come from iphone max variants suggest also max variant iphone you will find the display of iphone etc too small if you have money iphone pro max is the best priceperformance ratio now if not the iphone pro max is still good option for another years the battery is much better than iphone even than iphone pro max and the price is in the same category as iphone of course am talking about second hand phones if you want only new iphone than your best pick will be iphone plus if you want to switch to smaller iphone then iphone will be best priceperformance wise
Apple,iPhone 12,the problem had with this phone was the battery traded it in for pro max after months more true this doesnt have good battery if you are heavy user but is the same with all lineup pro pro max still is very good phone for someone who wants to enter in ios for the first time or is casual user is much better than its predecessor the iphone you can find good iphones in second hand market for eur battery health and months warranty for someone who has some extra money recommend iphone similar phone in some ways but much better battery even in heavy usage
Apple,iPhone 12,so have been samsung galaxy user all my life now am considering using an iphone and this more omg had iphone last year the battery kept running out had to keep reaching for the charger every hours when it went to
Apple,iPhone 12,way way worst than the iphone is disaster ui wise and imessage looked better
Apple,iPhone 12,typicall apple fan its not news and am not apple fan boy its truth every company uses different marketing term for their displays but underlying tech remains the same for all super amoled xdr oled actua display only thing which changes is the panel quality color calibaration etc which remains almost same for all top end phones now days hope you get my point
Apple,iPhone 12,bruh xdr oled is same as amoled its just marketing terms by different companies typicall apple fan
Apple,iPhone 12,dont think so after the update the battery is bit worse on my iphone way way worst than the iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,yes after battery life was improved dont think so after the update the battery is bit worse on my iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,recently purchased an iphone white have to get used to the swiping so far its decent more bro what
Apple,iPhone 12,anybody noticed battery life improvement with latest ios which came to control iphone more yes after battery life was improved
Apple,iPhone 12,have iphone but the is good for me
Apple,iPhone 12,have the iphone and looking at iphone specs it has the same display so and has so more no need to upgrade is still beast only thing is battery
Apple,iPhone 12,the iphone has more battery life than the iphone the iphone is rumored to be an more but the iphone pro max is still the same as the iphone pro max why
Apple,iPhone 12,bought it used with battery health battery gives me hrs of continuous use pubg works more the iphone has more battery life than the iphone the iphone is rumored to be an upgrade in battery again over the iphone the iphone is similar to the even though apple advertises hour longer battery life of course cheaper than those phones is new battery
Apple,iPhone 12,think iphone is better then iphone pro because iphone uses apple bionic and iphone pro uses apple bionic
Apple,iPhone 12,when my iphone was upgraded to ios the mic and speaker are affected when calling to more yeh same as pro bad speakers
Apple,iPhone 12,real ios gonna suck that puppy dry
Apple,iPhone 12,ios is better bro regret ever updating real
Apple,iPhone 12,totally agree this device can do everything its supposed to do battery takes slight hi more ios is better bro regret ever updating
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone has xdr oled screen no amoled bruh xdr oled is same as amoled its just marketing terms by different companies
Apple,iPhone 12,the advantages of iphone over the are as follows iphone has ips lcd screen more iphone has xdr oled screen no amoled
Apple,iPhone 12,need advice have the option to getting brand new iphone yes brand new or get is more the advantages of iphone over the are as follows iphone has ips lcd screen has amoled display the processor of is better has capabilities if you are buying refurbished iphone please check battery health
Apple,iPhone 12,would advise getting the iphone as it has the bionic over the bionic ch more forgot to mention that iphone is capable plus screen is oled plus its much more better in shape and sturdier plus better ip rating
Apple,iPhone 12,im planning to upgrade my years old iphone and will probably get iphone pro because more as an android user it seems bizarre to consider phone that apparently doesnt allow split screens
Apple,iPhone 12,been using my iphone for years and months now and can say its still rocking no la more exactly same situation here
Apple,iPhone 12,love this phone and ive had it since it was made im typing this on it totally agree this device can do everything its supposed to do battery takes slight hit after my year of usage but im happy that stayed on ios dont know about the user experience on ios so far its good
Apple,iPhone 12,its an okay phone fine in if you get it for under got it for through boost mobile brand new threw there deal battery life is really lacking but it will get you by and last for quite awhile wouldnt recommend at all for over
Apple,iPhone 12,not bad
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone is actually recommendable to someone who wants to use apple smartphone
Apple,iPhone 12,have been using this device for almost years worth it no regrets received ios up more years now totally worth it the best iphone had so far
Apple,iPhone 12,have an iphone on right now and its stable as ever wont update the firmware unless its really needed all apps use falls under the bar but it definitely gets warm on moderate usage and have to charge frequently thats is major letdown on this one otherwise it flies through all the apps as its intended to be
Apple,iPhone 12,most of that complaning abt probably bought fake you are right about that never had issues with my base model
Apple,iPhone 12,very good
Apple,iPhone 12,hi everyoane as talked to you before and asked about battery how long keep you on iphone more its normal drain battery percentage
Apple,iPhone 12,exactly most of that complaning abt probably bought fake
Apple,iPhone 12,switched days ago from iphone to iphone the battery is awesome on the iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,use an iphone and can say that it is great phone ios is smooth and secure and recommend everyone to use it
Apple,iPhone 12,thinking about trying this from fed up of android will merge ok easy enough was that more have been using both android and iphone side by side would never recommend buying an android again there are list of reasons but most important ones and software is designed optimally as per hardware specifications which supports long term utilization of single iphone then is the security and high level of difficulty to breach in it and last the software support for long time with no lag in performance even after years of use
Apple,iPhone 12,is it good to buy used iphone no its not good idea to use second hand iphone since you dont know what is the exact reason for the first user to sell it off unless you want to try your luck
Apple,iPhone 12,no this is not the solution its self imposed solution this may be case with ur next andr more thinking about trying this from fed up of android will merge ok easy enough was that or but not really sold on that mixed reviews
Apple,iPhone 12,switched it no differencei found on the internet is problem with iphone batteryi will more no this is not the solution its self imposed solution this may be case with ur next android phone so will reject android for this reason iphone battery is perfect am using it since almost yrs may be have used some third class third party charger or ur phone might have faced overheating issue in sunlight etc the biggest enemy of iphone battery health is heat and it might be the case that out of thousands ur phone is one odd that has manufacturing fault
Apple,iPhone 12,with on or auto both drains the battery very much changing it to brings back the good more switched it no differencei found on the internet is problem with iphone batteryi will switch back to android and the problem is fixed
Apple,iPhone 12,factin sonic the hedgehog movie this was sonics phone
Apple,iPhone 12,lightest iphone for inch battery still decent compare with iphone and
Apple,iPhone 12,over the years ive had many iphones but went back to android after buying iphone the earpiece giving up the ghost also knew someone who had iphone with the same problem but after lot of thinking thought id give apple another chance emigrate from android back to apple im really pleased have bought second hand iphone couldnt be more happier with it in my opinion its great phone find the battery life suits my needs does everything need it to photos are great im really pleased made the right choice will not be looking at changing phones now until there are no more updates for the iphone should have bought sooner well done apple for such great handset
Apple,iPhone 12,it is good dont be greedy and want brand new phone thank you love to sobriety preachers
Apple,iPhone 12,no it is good dont be greedy and want brand new phone
Apple,iPhone 12,this true as android are pme off can you use social media and lots apps not charge twice day nope still on charge per day my battery goes pretty well so far
Apple,iPhone 12,after two years my battery lasts day and sometimes bit more this true as android are pme off can you use social media and lots apps not charge twice day
Apple,iPhone 12,usually got around hours of screen on time without gaming and since you got new phon more wow thats sad state of affairs
Apple,iPhone 12,hello how long keep you the iphone battery just bought an iphone brand new and the bat more usually got around hours of screen on time without gaming and since you got new phone it has to learn your usage pattern so that it can optimise the battery to be better and the process usually takes around week
Apple,iPhone 12,for gaming best to use used to play pubg for long time the drained to now but so far so good
Apple,iPhone 12,hi should go for iphone or iphone pro the reason of me asking is the camera if im us more offcourse can buy iphone for photography and also for video recording dont go for pro model save ur money also if not record much videos then can bought google pixel pro
Apple,iPhone 12,does anyone know if the speaker on this is better than the mini no brother both are same
Apple,iPhone 12,be patient and get the instead well we never knew thanks for your help man if he listened to you unfortunately now he has to go back to get the
Apple,iPhone 12,should go for iphone or xs max is now the time to be future secure considering more had them booth xs max for better battery bigger screen slower device currently own iphone pro max and iphone booth new ill just go for xs max the battery life on its not good
Apple,iPhone 12,its beceause the screen of iphone have pwm google it the last iphone who dont have that more yes know already did lot of research and have posted solution as well
Apple,iPhone 12,am using iphone since yrs and shifted from samsung note and my eyes hurted alot in more its beceause the screen of iphone have pwm google it the last iphone who dont have that was the iphone because is lcd screen some people get headaches looking on oled screens with pwm and some people dont
Apple,iPhone 12,very nice phonebut for some reason in my countryit seems the pro max version is more popular its even easier getting cases on the max versions of iphones than the regular models
Apple,iPhone 12,agree to all what said except thingsoled display dont hurt eyes at all like other sup more am using iphone since yrs and shifted from samsung note and my eyes hurted alot in beginning even tried to sell iphone but was unabke to do that then became used to it after switching off adaptive light settings in accessibility menu and setting minimum brightness level to so it goes above with high ambient lighting but doesnt go below so its screen hurts some people eyes alot due to pwm
Apple,iPhone 12,if just want to experience ios software than is better at low cost than battery is be more agree to all what said except thingsoled display dont hurt eyes at all like other super amoled android smartphones also front and rear camera is much better in iphone just equivalent to iphone also iphone is much stronger than iphone due ceramic shield body
Apple,iPhone 12,what will be the best option to choose between if im considering the price and spe more if just want to experience ios software than is better at low cost than battery is better in iphone moreover people will rush behind for led display but lcd display is good for our eyes if have fiber broadband than is not big issue fiber broadband is way better than iphone is way better than unnecessarily dont waste more camera is slightly improved in that one also in night mode in day light its same
Apple,iPhone 12,the life for battery its iphone depends on the use mine lasted brand new and half days with one full charge
Apple,iPhone 12,what is the best in battery life or what is your opinion on this phone have better battery and optimization than
Apple,iPhone 12,is anyone here facing faded display issue like white wash let me know if there is any solution
Apple,iPhone 12,when will the iphone be released need tb gbram and kmah bat what is kmah kilomilliamperehours it would be kah think before commenting
Apple,iPhone 12,lol these days most apple haters are the one that cant afford iphone iphone no longer luxu more its not that you have to think like apple hate that woosh sound sending message its the little things apple way or highway android are making some great phones now so its sucks they dont do rcs so we all miss out either way sending videos will always require another app all because america stuck on sms
Apple,iPhone 12,its strange that the big ios is popping up on my iphone along with ios too apple giving you choice to opt from both on same day
Apple,iPhone 12,what should choose between iphone and is extra worth it for people say there more go for iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,still good and and work perfectly battery life is just average and thats not big problem
Apple,iPhone 12,couldnt make my mindso expended made losses but now will stick to iphone atleast more what should choose between iphone and is extra worth it for people say theres no difference in cameras is it true know both are better than im just stuck between
Apple,iPhone 12,you will buy next iphone you will consume couldnt make my mindso expended made losses but now will stick to iphone atleast for yrs as im happy using it except that that it hangsfreezes rarely
Apple,iPhone 12,have used iphone in span of last months currently using iphone more you will buy next iphone you will consume
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone or iphone pro both used have used iphone in span of last months currently using iphone im happy iphone is also equally good lighter than iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,you didnt get white did you have it on white and its in perfect condition almost two years now
Apple,iPhone 12,amazing screen smooth performance and so far no lagging battery health just average using it for almost year already
Apple,iPhone 12,good performance excellent screen quality average battery life
Apple,iPhone 12,paint is peeling off from frame you didnt get white did you
Apple,iPhone 12,does move to ios work as intended for whatsapp does it move all chats and media just like it more move to ios works perfectly in moving whatsapp but its pain to get it to work first of all the iphone creates hotspot that the android phone connects to the problem is that this hotspot provides no internet so some devices automatically disconnect even though it might show connected so had to turn off mobile data on the android and then got past the authenticating screen when initiating whatsapp transfer it got stuck at for long time but went smoothly after about minutes
Apple,iPhone 12,own both phones you have mentioned iphone photos are natural not overrefined like other ph more which both
Apple,iPhone 12,first of all would like to say that this phone is simply amazing was user of the moto more does move to ios work as intended for whatsapp does it move all chats and media just like it is in android to android

Apple,iPhone 12,iphone pro max or which should go for get the ip great on everything
Apple,iPhone 12,im never disappointed having an iphone always great performance and design best of all is the feeling of knowing that you have in your hand the best of the best in cell phones had several models such as se and now love it
Apple,iPhone 12,im using sony ericsson does this have infraread too no stay on sony its different world missing best brand ever sony ericsson rihistory
Apple,iPhone 12,spent months with my iphone and it is quite good compared to my last phone my broken more the actually lighter if you dont live in the us the us version weighs while the international version weighs due to the lack of mmwave
Apple,iPhone 12,is anyone facing wifi issues my device shows connected to wifi but then is not able to sendreceive data on any app all apps show that am offline happens with mobile data as well only way is to restart the device its not an issue with my wifi router as no other device faces this issue please help

Apple,iPhone 12,really like my iphone though wish id have got the pro instead just for th more still without telephoto lenses iphone clicks really nice pics even in low light love the feel performance of my iphone im using in india
Apple,iPhone 12,may be using fake iphone exactly
Apple,iPhone 12,hang problem very poor phone hanging isshu am vesy sad may be using fake iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,tip turn off rise to wake save your battery
Apple,iPhone 12,lucky you my iphone battery life is at after year and two months its more one thing hope dont know but am practically doing it and thats why sharing here that dont need to turn off automatic brightness if want to keep it at certain brightness or above like to avoid pwm flickering issue just need to set it to like and it will automatically never bring brightness below the set level however when there is too much light like sun etc then it will take brightness up and then again bring to ur set levelinterestingly it will not take it below ur set level even go in complete dark think apple introduced this feature silently after people complained about pwm flickering issue in dark environment
Apple,iPhone 12,its an anomaly am using iphone since almost yr and its battery life dropped to in more lucky you my iphone battery life is at after year and two months its still very good tho as lowered the brightness disabled auto brightness and automatic app updates
Apple,iPhone 12,follow pattern for iphones like charge your device between to charge my iphone more how long do you have your phone
Apple,iPhone 12,dont know if its normal but mine in the last weeks dropped from to nowso no idea its an anomaly am using iphone since almost yr and its battery life dropped to in months and now its still at have been almost continuously using same charger tronsmart travel adapter wcp but have been using its normal port usbai think its max in this period and now since weeks or so using its pd port and an old nexus charger but battery still at what observed that this battery drop usually occurs after some ios updates and always immediately update my iphone on whatever latest update comes
Apple,iPhone 12,always chrage with slow charger and keep the battery between to percent to sustain bat more im doing this since got the phone use the charger from my tablet its charger
Apple,iPhone 12,bought my ip month ago its battery health was for month then it decreased to more dont know if its normal but mine in the last weeks dropped from to nowso no idea
Apple,iPhone 12,so sell your iphone or he could just do something called getting it fixed
Apple,iPhone 12,why cant you turn off the dailing dings you should be able to turn this off for personal dailing put this in place it should be already come on apple
Apple,iPhone 12,idk why im having problem the speakers they sound really bad and low any thoughts on more check if there is dust there mine has problem with charging and after cleaned up is good as new
Apple,iPhone 12,yet you will continue to buy it because even though apple face id is useless there is someth more lol these days most apple haters are the one that cant afford iphone iphone no longer luxury product especially in north america iphone is going for the same price as mid range android phones and unlike mid rage android phones most of them made with plastic and has very poor spec iphone still look and feel and perform just as good as new iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,it started off with me having my iphone which ive had since th grade it was better back then but as time goes on and they keep creating newer gen phones the iphone just wasnt able to keep up with all the new things added after experiencing many problems with the such as the phone getting hot freezing and just generally not working in some situations decided it was finally time for an upgrade so worked until was able to afford my own phone after saving up enough went to try to get the iphone but never thought would be leaving out with the iphone overall think this is the best phone have ever used and always had the best feeling and never had bad experience with this phone at the rate they are releasing new iphones it wont be long before the iphone is outdated features there are new features such as no home button more and better cameras etc they have upgraded the camera to have new integration such as megapixel wide megapixel ultrawide resolution with the iphone plus only having mp camera with autofocus the iphone has better significant battery life to last hours which is times higher than the iphone which only has hours they also have added to the iphone for better phone service and connection the phone is also compatible with wireless charging it has built in ceramic shield front which makes it tougher to crack price ranges and variants the iphone cost is about dollars but you can make payments on it for month money can be taken off the cost if you trade in another iphone but it depends your current phone and the condition of it there are many colors to choose from and variants of the phone as well such as the iphone mini pro and the pro max with the mini being the smallest and the pro max being the largest size software the latest software in the iphone is ios which redesigns the whole layout of how the phone works features included in this update are portrait mode new facetime layout and enhancements added spatial audio redesign of the notifications bug fixes upgrades to the ai siri and improved performance of the phone
Apple,iPhone 12,for people thinking if the phone is worth it or not iphone is the cheapest iphone with from apple is not the best of course and you can find better priced iphones out there if you are not interested in something like iphone pro or pro max keep in mind though that iphone models older than years series and below will come with battery health of usually is not entirely bad but just keep in mind that if you want to use your iphone for more than month battery update will definitely be required so extra money spent thus being said iphone models even the second hand ones come with minimum battery health because is newer model now comes the more tricky part if you want to buy an iphone directly from the store new at full price is not worth it because the iphone gb variant is almost the same price as iphone gb variant even though the iphone is not so much of an improvement from iphone am talking about vanilla versions here still if you have both phones at similar prices iphone is the better option but if you can get an iphone much cheaper something like unsealed or almost new from specialized stores then is worth it you will pay eur less than an iphone conclusion iphone directly from the store new with full price is not worth it get the iphone instead at similar price iphone second hand device as almost new or something similar much cheaper than an iphone is worth it
Apple,iPhone 12,trust me buy iphone pro max dont buy pro now bcoz pro is not having face id with mask optionbuy as its phone and it does have option for option for face id with mask only thing in pro is telephoto lens other than that buying pro now makes no sense
Apple,iPhone 12,maybe the years of software updates compared to and the quality of the products we are paying for
Apple,iPhone 12,thats still not an excuse to say phone has good battery life you are just making goo more would definitely not be better off with moto power because it is not available in my country it wont get software updates for more than year it will be much slower im not even sure if the has big cores otherwise it will probably perform worse than an iphone also emmc storage like what year is it its built from plastic yuck also not good for the environment it doesnt support airdrop icloud etc which all use with my ipad and mac its way too big like extremely too big the iphone se is pretty much the upper limit of size im comfortable in using maybe could get by with the iphone or but im more comfortable with the se size the camera will be worse the video will be way worse wont buy phone that puts these fake mp cameras on their back it is less secure especially after few years of no software updates at this point motorola is sadly owned by lenovo which is chinese dont like the chinese government no stereo speakers no ois no water resistance no pfps video of course no either no nfc only charging and that at this battery size no wireless charging though have to admit dont use it but it could be useful when im somewhere where there is no lightning cable didnt get out of house in the past months really what would prefer about it were headphone jack and hz display but otherwise for me phones like these are just powerbank with screen and android also thought like you in the past thats why changed my iphone for an xperia aqua back in the day because after years cheaper android has to be better right well after actually using it was slowly but painfully proven wrong over period of years there is quality difference the slow processor the smaller storage the camera that takes ages to shutter the regular overheating from light usage the slow charging the fing plastic back that scratches when looking at it the wrong way the lower grade vibration motor the positioning of the charging port in the upper left hand corner wtf just the lackluster performance in both the basics speed camera and the little things built haptics have made me conclude to never ever again buy these cheap plastic things in this price range and the iphone se is priced like those but doesnt have those issues because it is an old flagship and that is the only option for me even if it means buying used but at least you understood that people use their phone differently and have different perceptions of good enough battery life of course its battery life will not be enough for someone who plays cod mobile or pubg for hrs day even though id be more concerned about the user instead of the phone battery in that case for someone like me who plugs their phone in over night this is absolutely non issue my battery life is better than with the iphone and its very degraded battery used before
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone se how about that have it and im happy no battery life is not abysmal its like more thats still not an excuse to say phone has good battery life you are just making good of what you have your se lasts day with your usage cool but you still cant deny that it has worse battery life compared to other phones and that you would be better off with say moto power that will last you days using your usage sure dont play heavy games with my pixel and it feels snappy to me but still have to admit it has slow processor or at least slower processor than oneplus
Apple,iPhone 12,guys going to buy iphone for the st time so not sure which should buy iphone pr more pro has curved edges telephoto and better battery life and the same oled screen but will last year longer
Apple,iPhone 12,and thats why you get an android phone preferably samsung pixel oneplus more iphone se how about that have it and im happy no battery life is not abysmal its like any other phone and didnt double my phone usage since then like seemingly everybody else did
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone battery replacement costs bucks in which world would you get phone for bucks more sorry mate big mistake of mine he should just get battery replacement
Apple,iPhone 12,its not like you were forced to buy it if you think its disrespectful then go buy more yet you will continue to buy it because even though apple face id is useless there is something that brings you back to iphones maybe the high prices and the associated feeling of luxury
Apple,iPhone 12,which one should buy or budget matters is cheaper unless you really care about battery life but what is your budget because that matters the most because you could just get an android phone
Apple,iPhone 12,producing phone during the pandemic with only faceid no fingerprint when everyone on the more and thats why you get an android phone preferably samsung pixel oneplus all with fingerprint sensors that work well when wearing mask unless of course if you are trapped in the ecosystem which apple has worked hard to produce
Apple,iPhone 12,you could get battery replacement but fair you could just get new phone instead with tha more iphone battery replacement costs bucks in which world would you get phone for bucks are you looking for feature phone
Apple,iPhone 12,true but to be honest the same guy literally just spreads way too much lies in this forum th more dont see appeal ugly ui on it stuck same old unless your love memojis big dealrather have choice in apps can even get their gif or gallery right samsung one ui is much more user friendly
Apple,iPhone 12,and yet apple still beats them in terms of battery life xd se cough
Apple,iPhone 12,iphones are one time investment and then they keep going on and on ive been using an more you could get battery replacement but fair you could just get new phone instead with that money
Apple,iPhone 12,megapixels honestly dont really mean shit apple with their mp sensor on the pros is de more apple is not destroying samsungs mp sensor in fact its not even destroying googles mp sensor not with photos anyway
Apple,iPhone 12,youre liar just because the pro max isnt really anything good doesnt more see when samsung and oneplus use hz ltpo panel macro capabilities its not much to you but when apple does it its something just really great
Apple,iPhone 12,got my blue ip yesterday my last ip was few back honestly this phone is magnificent the only slight drawback ive noticed is that the battery life goes down faster when browsing the internet but full charge with light use takes me over day if you are thinking of getting series ip and can afford it go for the promax for light use dont play games on my phones the base shud be sufficient for most users
Apple,iPhone 12,one of the last remaining phones that is under cm tall no wonder they sell in bucket loads thats not the reason why iphones sell very well or at least the main reason wanna know why things steve jobs marketing success story
Apple,iPhone 12,how did lie have you seen samsungs mega pixels battery and sim selection the iphone pr more have you used an iphone before if not then your opinion is still trash and waste of time
Apple,iPhone 12,have you used iphone before if not then ur opinion on iphone is ridiculous it so beautiful
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone pro max is the best iphone not the best phone do like apple don more capacity doesnt really mean shit if the phones not very well optimised the iphone pro max with its mah battery slaughters the ultra with mah battery iphones are the perfect example of higher numbers dont really mean everything
Apple,iPhone 12,its nickname and dont have an origin for it im not some little kid just more youre liar just because the pro max isnt really anything good doesnt mean its not the best despite the improvements ive seen in the pro max was the longer battery life advanced cameras that lets to get close to subject at cm improved in more places and soild performance with hz ltpo display
Apple,iPhone 12,got the ios update in india and just updated my iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,oh and the name so called starlight makes me think youre from my little pony more its nickname and dont have an origin for it im not some little kid just came up with it and never said anything bad about the pro max just it isnt the best phone
Apple,iPhone 12,you do realize this is where you can post your opinions not everyone has to agree with yo more oh and the name so called starlight makes me think youre from my little pony and not actually userhater so whatever also the is still good but the pro max was already as good for battery life which lasts all day long on single charge
Apple,iPhone 12,mines at after year almost year and battery capacity is still at charge usually between from to rarely have charged from below and all the way up to
Apple,iPhone 12,wrong see that you have the mini in your favorite devices list even though your explana more you do realize this is where you can post your opinions not everyone has to agree with you or even me
Apple,iPhone 12,after months battery capacity is at huge mines at after year
Apple,iPhone 12,am keen to get this phone what is the camera ability like it is new phone or new camera im happy user of iphone in india its fast fluid and light in weight gifted this to my wife and she is happy personally use iphone which is also good iphone but little bulky and no night mode in front camera
Apple,iPhone 12,keep spreading misinformations bet no one agrees with you even though the iphone pro more iphone pro max is the best iphone not the best phone do like apple dont get me wrong but it isnt the best phone but it has bad outdated software system samsung has much more features faster charging and much more mah iphone is like the iphone except with bit of upgrade
Apple,iPhone 12,this iphone is such downgrade from iphone apart from its bionic chip probably the worst more keep spreading misinformations bet no one agrees with you even though the iphone pro max is actually the best because of its powerful chip and nothing touches what apple brings to the table
Apple,iPhone 12,first of all imessage isnt as awful but youre the one who is awful at trying to more its my opinion you can handle the truth
Apple,iPhone 12,imessage is fun and faster than the other messenger apps agree but honestly they addressed some of those issues in the pro series regardless of how fun and useful imessage is as what the same guy says its not really huge issue at all
Apple,iPhone 12,the best phone iphone true but to be honest the same guy literally just spreads way too much lies in this forum that the imessage is crap when its not lmao imessage is far better quick and easy but far from awful
Apple,iPhone 12,exactly this dude is an absolute toxic he needs to like stop with the lies and misinformat more the best phone iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,tried imessage was awful and ios is fugly as hell one ui is the new ios but better imessage is fun and faster than the other messenger apps
Apple,iPhone 12,lol exactly this dude is an absolute toxic he needs to like stop with the lies and misinformations in this forum where he was trying to say even though imessage is not that awful and so does ios but still leaves me sick and tired of those people who repeats the same thing in this forum over and over every single year
Apple,iPhone 12,im sorry but if ever there was case of the emperors new clothes this ui is it more tried imessage was awful and ios is fugly as hell one ui is the new ios but better
Apple,iPhone 12,recently bought this phone previously was samsung user but im having issue with it more is there no one who can help
Apple,iPhone 12,where did he mention face id didnt work with mask he said it didnt work out of more well he started it by saying that face id is scam when its not lol imagine asking for face id that works well with face mask garbage luckily face id works great out of the box without mask on but still leaves me sick and tired of those people who repeats the same crap over and over every year when it comes to face id personally dont have any issues with face id but the only problem that face id doesnt seem to work well is face masks garbage right but lets be real face id is great but crapvid literally makes face id even harder to scan faces with overrated and garbage face masks lol
Apple,iPhone 12,bro your information is all over the place what is your point are you trying to say android more exactly this dude literally spreads way too much lies on this forum saying the battery life on the iphone is inferior when the pro max has an advantage to last day or two because of its efficiency no wonder he got the and complains like total jerk just like the same guy that says face id isnt working out of the box cuz of the mask garbage im overly sick and tired of those people who repeats the same thing over and over every year just because face id doesnt work well with the overrated face masks lol garbage
Apple,iPhone 12,what are you even saying bro face id works well out of the box but the only problem with fa more where did he mention face id didnt work with mask he said it didnt work out of the box so maybe you should be looking at how he sets up face id and what angle is looking at
Apple,iPhone 12,face id is scam received brand new phone and face id not working out of the box what are you even saying bro face id works well out of the box but the only problem with face id is that masks no longer works well with the as well as the pro series how high are you on right now lmao seriously stop with the lies no one cares
Apple,iPhone 12,bought this phone months backbattery health at still and going strongrecommended
Apple,iPhone 12,just recently use that devicesometime im feel little bit disappointed im from android rip lg user who always keep audio quality in top notch first thing first have sony wix and whx and like you know this phone dont have ldac im use high tier iems like moondrop ssony ier and connected with external dac but the sound still worst idk why when im listen to tidalthe soundstage feel really weirdimaging is not crisplack treble extensionlack dynamic and another thing is cant play my flacdsd file have destop audio setup tostill use phone when go outside but at least give decent audio lmao about interface ui and anything know this phone have to much minimize and make you cant do anything so dont care to much bc still have my android phone ios have to much bug im just use this for only for whatsappbrowsing and light game onlyso this bat still enough for memore that hour sot when term of camera for me still ok not the best prosbc of mp sensor per picture dont take to much storage compare to android with mp or higherso you can send your picture at whatsapp with zero compress consfeature cam to basic compare to my xiaomi mi and when come to group photo my phone always been use idk why people brainwashing about that cam so my conclusion is for android user who like exploregamingcritical listening music and make to much modding etcmaybe this phone not the best but for simple guy who dont care about smart gimmick feature this phone is great friendly messagebuy phone for your needs
Apple,iPhone 12,guys amazed to see that with ios now even japanese mode iphone can also take pics with creating that shutter sound was waiting for this feature because japanese model resale was less due to this issue now its no more there thanks apple
Apple,iPhone 12,wow nice phone good battery life
Apple,iPhone 12,my honest review camera is beast battery backup is epic but heating problem is there while playing minutes
Apple,iPhone 12,am using clone it gives me best results
Apple,iPhone 12,whats your iphone battery health just asking after months mine is on
Apple,iPhone 12,very nice phone like it very much
Apple,iPhone 12,had the iphone for about month now social media youtube and few hours of mobile gam more there is iphone clone the worst phone ever wish the iphone clone have good camera like real iphone and good battery people dont buy the clone although they look alike dont buy it
Apple,iPhone 12,so when your bt headphones run outta battery and you dont have the charger are you going more my galaxy buds last for before they need charging the case doubles that and can even charge them on the back of my phone having headphone jack is always nice but cmon
Apple,iPhone 12,think zapple lost its appeal in then go buy your android and enjoy your two years of updates and lagbased software
Apple,iPhone 12,hi youre not having any heating issues when playing mobile legends just like the person you responded to plan on getting this and game hours straight but not always would appreciate the help
Apple,iPhone 12,of course its important but to be honest dont find the headphone jack useful more so when your bt headphones run outta battery and you dont have the charger are you going to use solar power
Apple,iPhone 12,better batteries on samsung sot ip was hours is only hrs
Apple,iPhone 12,hot but not overheat
Apple,iPhone 12,yes mini to small videos mostly calls thank you dude
Apple,iPhone 12,looks like you have answered your own question but wonder you are restricting your self to more did own huawei and at the end of the day what frustrated me was the lack of google service apple it is then
Apple,iPhone 12,between this and pro should go with huawei or apple make up my mind never used an more looks like you have answered your own question but wonder you are restricting your self to these two have you considered the an excellent alternative to widen your choices
Apple,iPhone 12,itssimon sep for me and other gamers the headphone jack is important of course its important but to be honest dont find the headphone jack useful so no need for the headphone jack but wireless headphones are the alternatives
Apple,iPhone 12,for real no one cares about the headphone jack and fm radio it has sim card sl more for me and other gamers the headphone jack is important
Apple,iPhone 12,main disadvantages are no radio or card slot you need to purchase head set and charger sep more for real no one cares about the headphone jack and fm radio it has sim card slot get this nonsensical out of your mind dude
Apple,iPhone 12,androids battery iphone lol
Apple,iPhone 12,seeking honest opinion from genuine mini user should opted for mini or regular more yes mini to small videos mostly calls
Apple,iPhone 12,regular is also very comfortable check the screen to body ratio its super easy to hold more hi what do you think the optimal price should be for after is out have an option to buy gb for right know so im wondering is it worth it to wait since this price is pretty good
Apple,iPhone 12,cameras are the same except that get ultrawide in selfies too in iphone the screen on more true that iphonesapple devices are costlier in india as compared to other parts of the world due to massive tax structures
Apple,iPhone 12,whatsapp massages delayed on my iphone and sometimes whatsapp calling shows just calling no more these are some inherent issues in particular devicesapps just like receive outlook notifications faster than my gmail notifications
Apple,iPhone 12,deleted post the battery percentage in the setting is an estimate if you dont notice difference in performance then you should not worry about it and remember that once you notice decrease and want to change it it is only my battery once decreaed at time that is probably when new estimate was made
Apple,iPhone 12,after reading your post have purchased iphone and currently using apple iphone and its working great
Apple,iPhone 12,well main differences are that has lcd screen and has an oled and the newest nm process more cameras are the same except that get ultrawide in selfies too in iphone the screen on is not bad at all its bright and one can live with it the price difference is huge in india starts at flipkart for gb whereas starts at its difference of
Apple,iPhone 12,confused between iphone and iphone though hear about the battery of iphone is lowe more well main differences are that has lcd screen and has an oled and the newest nm processor and better cameras slightly soo in my opinion the price difference is not that much is worth it definitely
Apple,iPhone 12,definitely the iphone which has large battery life than on the iphone but if you want more when will the iphone be launched
Apple,iPhone 12,according to specification iphone is water resistant up to for min do not try to che more yes wouldnt advise to risk it either dropping phone in water is the same like dropping it on concrete its gamble whether it will be fine or broken
Apple,iPhone 12,upon frequent use im having quite bad headache maybe because of the eye strain its happen more use it work work and have no such issue
Apple,iPhone 12,after seven months of use battery health drops to impressive ithink is best choice phone do you use your phone often like heavily or is it like everyday now and then tasks like checking emails scrolling youtube social media etc
Apple,iPhone 12,chowdhury aug worst phone ever used horrible battery condition bruh just turn on low power mode and disable background refresh thatll help the job better
Apple,iPhone 12,already done all such things they are of no use what are you talking about there is literally nothing wrong with reduce white point it actually helps the job better even at there are no flicks expect the oled displays to be any good
Apple,iPhone 12,worst phone ever used horrible battery condition
Apple,iPhone 12,enable reduce white point then you should not see any problems for your eyes already done all such things they are of no use
Apple,iPhone 12,deleted post enable reduce white point then you should not see any problems for your eyes
Apple,iPhone 12,yeah of course but high pwm doesnt cause any eye strain and headaches especially when more who gave guarantee and keeping brightness above harms in another way once use it in the dark
Apple,iPhone 12,actually low pwm is the issue what have read that pwm of hz or above doesnt cause issue more yeah of course but high pwm doesnt cause any eye strain and headaches especially when keeping the brightness at which could potentially reduce the risk of eyes and headaches iphone might get this resolved if im guaranteed
Apple,iPhone 12,its pwm every devices have it along with the iphone and samsung ultra which has more actually low pwm is the issue what have read that pwm of hz or above doesnt cause issue to most of the people but lesser than that causes eye strain and headache iphone has hz which is causing me eye strain and headache previously was using samsung note which had hz of pwm and only difference of hz was much lesser better on eyes
Apple,iPhone 12,yesterday moved from xr to iphone have eye strain as well related headache overnight more giving my personal example tried to sell out my iphone because of this eye strain but was unable then become slightly used to it but not completely still my left eye becomes red and feel pain in eyes and head
Apple,iPhone 12,giving my personal example tried to sell out my iphone because of this eye strain but more its pwm every devices have it along with the iphone and samsung ultra which has low pwm on its own so dont know what youre talking about
Apple,iPhone 12,my iphone earpiece is not working is there any solution already done full factory reset still not working
Apple,iPhone 12,after shifting from xr to iphone did feel eye strain because of pwm screen flickering more most people keep the brightness at which is perfectly alright depending on your personal preference right now think ill take the pro max cause its probably my favorite but for those who want the hz ltpo displays advice that you should probably wait for this model to land in september through october
Apple,iPhone 12,moved from iphone xr works better if you are thinking of taking or the flagship android more after shifting from xr to iphone did feel eye strain because of pwm screen flickering issue in iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,have owned many phones over the years mostly android flagships this phone just works no issues no bugs everything works as it should perfect for work
Apple,iPhone 12,why does my phone heat up can someone please help my iphone doesnt heat up that much even if im playing games for hours like mobile legends and lol basic games but im playing it for hours hours straight or even more sometimes
Apple,iPhone 12,but then the price of iphone will be large as it will be newly launched then dont more pricing on the range will remain the same as the iphone range those rumors are hoax
Apple,iPhone 12,after year or two youll feel nothing actually your shift after this long time shou more but then the price of iphone will be large as it will be newly launched then dont want to spend huge amout dont mind if am using devices delayed by years non latest thanks
Apple,iPhone 12,guys what do you recommend pro max or go for the pro max if you want phone with better battery life matte back more premium build triple cameras and larger display go for the if you want smaller phone with flat edges and an bionic chipset
Apple,iPhone 12,recently bought fe and not very much impressed with it want to shift to iphone more after year or two youll feel nothing actually your shift after this long time should be something else and little modern like iphone for example
Apple,iPhone 12,anyone affected with pegasus what guys say the mvt tool by amnesty is reliable or is it itself way that urself will provide for hacking ur phone because the process mentioned on various websites itself seems fishy
Apple,iPhone 12,how usable is this with one hand compared to the inch iphones
Apple,iPhone 12,hey guys need to know how many hours can be use iphone if brightness set to very low and more almost day
Apple,iPhone 12,android user for long time wanted to change to ios just one thing to ask in ios is there more no you cant because iphone dont let you access the files you need jailbreak which is hard and takes long time
Apple,iPhone 12,the battery capacity is good superb camera running speed is good past experience in android phones are bad
Apple,iPhone 12,got mine weeks ago its gorgeous battery is ok camera is impressive and im impressed for me there is nothing to worry about this phone
Apple,iPhone 12,battery duration is dependent on usage therefore you cannot with accuracy state that it will more own this phone and know it
Apple,iPhone 12,two days with one charge battery duration is dependent on usage therefore you cannot with accuracy state that it will last two days on one charge
Apple,iPhone 12,hi as am about to get this phone looking so forward to itwhat are the best settings to save battery live
Apple,iPhone 12,bad batteryfast drain two days with one charge
Apple,iPhone 12,was talking about the issues that people were having on this iphone when you lower the more keep my phone most of the times at brightness have not noticed any flickering am used to this brightness on all my phones till now no heating issues as well
Apple,iPhone 12,ok then telll me why apple is adding hz this fall surely this goes against my point more suspect you dont own this phone if thats true no one in the world cares what your opinion is sorry to say
Apple,iPhone 12,really loved but my wallet letting me down
Apple,iPhone 12,know all the tech you missing my point completely yes samsung do hz but its messed more ok then telll me why apple is adding hz this fall surely this goes against my point is if you are an adult you surely have more important things to worry about than the refresh rate on tiny screen that you will notice for day or two until you adjust
Apple,iPhone 12,do not know on which issues you are talking about was talking about the issues that people were having on this iphone when you lower the brightness down to you can see that it flickers which gives you an eye strain while the lcd display on the iphone it doesnt seem to give you an eye strain next up is the heating issues although the company that never makes iphones heat up when using cameras thats why they got bad unit there are some workarounds that practically could solve this problem but its not practical enough mean we are in lockdown where things starts to get worse than
Apple,iPhone 12,see samsung and other brands offer displays and hz unlike apple at about maybe more know all the tech you missing my point completely yes samsung do hz but its messed with their thermals and battery longevity whats the point to get slightly more fluid scrolling experience for bragging rights my point is if you are an adult you surely have more important things to worry about than the refresh rate on tiny screen that you will notice for day or two until you adjust for me choose battery life and well optimized software every time
Apple,iPhone 12,is there any phones that has no issues do not know on which issues you are talking about
Apple,iPhone 12,dude is hz on inch display really that important to you it looks good dont get me more see samsung and other brands offer displays and hz unlike apple at about maybe half the price or of the price
Apple,iPhone 12,it is literally half the frametime so it looks smoother ig the market is there already lol come on
Apple,iPhone 12,that was because of the shortage of hz screen panals which samsung had as it was preparing more is there any phones that has no issues
Apple,iPhone 12,yeah but fortunately the hz display is now likely to happen on the iphone pros only more that was because of the shortage of hz screen panals which samsung had as it was preparing it for note ultra and ultra so this year they have achieved it and now supplying it to apple note one thing not only hz will make its first debut on iphones but the iphones of this year would have better battery life on hz adpative refresh rate than any other phones because of its optimization
Apple,iPhone 12,know everything am just telling that you can feel the difference if you will use hz di more also in my opinion think hertz is way smoother than hertz thats the only wish had in my iphone pro max wishlist
Apple,iPhone 12,just because iphones have hz does not mean it slow and sluggish but didnt you see th more know everything am just telling that you can feel the difference if you will use hz display in your daily life it feels very smooth against iphone series
Apple,iPhone 12,you can literally feel the difference am using an hz refresh rate phone and my friend more just because iphones have hz does not mean it slow and sluggish but didnt you see the reports that the iphone pros were getting hertz with ltpo oled always on retina display larger batteries and in display touch id
Apple,iPhone 12,hz is smoother than hz no doubt just dont think its worth giving up that much battery more you can literally feel the difference am using an hz refresh rate phone and my friends iphone pro max is feeling sluggish and lagging
Apple,iPhone 12,would like to share my recent unpleasant experience with iphone bought iphone days more get over it this was released in not the iphone pros will have an excellent choice over the iphone from its not perfect yet its still premium to buy dont get me wrong its still the best iphone that apple has ever made
Apple,iPhone 12,no games dont play games either but still mine lasts days
Apple,iPhone 12,do play games no games
Apple,iPhone 12,also get one day battery life with sot of around hrs and after six months battery health more do play games
Apple,iPhone 12,after months having iphone can tell you that my battery health percentage is still more also get one day battery life with sot of around hrs and after six months battery health is at
Apple,iPhone 12,still need the pro or pro max to get hz samsung has hz on its phones dude is hz on inch display really that important to you it looks good dont get me wrong but its novelty and ends up just being battery drain but not to worry loads of phones have it and think the market will get there but for me personally unless im gaming on huge monitor couldnt care less
Apple,iPhone 12,jesus christ it was released in not the iphone pro and pro max is hz still need the pro or pro max to get hz samsung has hz on its phones
Apple,iPhone 12,can use adapter for phone or is this harmful
Apple,iPhone 12,the two year life ruled happened on this battery died plus now screen issue last two phones were super but at or near the two year life they needed replacing this time gave her samsung yet will try iphone myself have never ever had sammy issues hope not on my first phone
Apple,iPhone 12,guys just glance at the comments on these cheap chinese phones like xiomihuawei oppo they pr more in my country those products seem to be less and less rarely seen because now people understand better for those with limited budget there are better options from samsung nokia or lg who will be more responsible if something happens with their devices
Apple,iPhone 12,the best ever
Apple,iPhone 12,absolutely no problem at all with iphone battery lasts days others things run well dont know what is wrong with you people
Apple,iPhone 12,well he literally never likes this iphone that has no hertz thats why people could more so glad you spelled savvy right lol had to google it few times
Apple,iPhone 12,first off your not just wrong youre stupid they only have gb of ram with slow hz more well he literally never likes this iphone that has no hertz thats why people could not tell difference between and basically when ipad pros had the capability of hertz it was great to have it on iphones it has been said for years to come with hertz but now think its about time to move on and get back on our way to right direction just dont put yourself in exaggeration promise me youll love the hertz on an iphone pro and pro max and you wont be disappointed if youre tech savvy user
Apple,iPhone 12,as developer and engineer im not an apple fan because of their laptops but their hardware is so easy to optimize for and although theoretically not as powerful as some other chipsets out there the api instructions are efficient as it gets its very expensive but you paying premium for their really good engineers and rd team good stuff
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone taught me to always carry power banks and charging adapter with me even with more after months having iphone can tell you that my battery health percentage is still with one charge my battery lasts about days
Apple,iPhone 12,no matter how good or even the best iphone peoples read haters are always talking about iphones price which is expensive andyes it is unfortunately peoples are seldom talking about iphones quality and ios andyes it is sold remakably better
Apple,iPhone 12,can use my iphone for days without charging it mild usage only dont know why more maybe hisher iphone is clone
Apple,iPhone 12,what were you saying you selfish brat honestly the face id and finger id are both useful more first off your not just wrong youre stupid they only have gb of ram with slow hz display for aud and the cheapest phone is yet again aud for better specs
Apple,iPhone 12,no finger print sensor when everyone is using facemask is stupid what were you saying you selfish brat honestly the face id and finger id are both useful during quarantine so you better shut your mouth up and move on there is also the next iphone generation that will likely to bring the touch id as in the display to make it more secure and nope face id feature isnt going anywhere it will stay with the in display touch id
Apple,iPhone 12,weak signal reception compared to android phone im talking out of experience not just more yes was like that ios never good signals odd
Apple,iPhone 12,as my experience with iphone to found not great device specially after sale service more yeah stay disappointed you little selfish brat obviously there is something new that is likely to come out in the winter and that worse year is going to end after christmas eve
Apple,iPhone 12,hello everyone im interested in this phone when the price drop down bit more this more yes can go for itbut make sure to buy either gb or gb variant bcos want to use it for long term
Apple,iPhone 12,any issues with the signal reception anyone weak signal reception compared to android phone im talking out of experience not just hear say
Apple,iPhone 12,wont and never ever use the auto brightness under sunlight which means maximum bright more so how can you see where to press answer or reject when you are outside and under direct sunlight when somebody calls
Apple,iPhone 12,agree with you use charger and the phone doesnt feel any hot try to keep it abov more use the anker charger on my it doesnt get hot and charges just nicely
Apple,iPhone 12,well am the other way around regret buying iphone when outside iphone screen can more wont and never ever use the auto brightness under sunlight which means maximum brightness it will make the screen oled faster to burn in and ruin the resale value at much remember this is not lcd oled will suffer burned in display and it is permanent damage because of maximum brightness maximum heat led enemy is heat since led producing light and heat
Apple,iPhone 12,display camera performance these are undoubtedly strong points of this phone but bat more dont use your phone while charging this is the best answer using any charger while using the phone will escalate the heat twice any fast charging will stop at to reduce the heat since the battery is well loaded and will continue on max charging the same thing going with electric car and the battery degradation not much different
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone my next phone want to buyat the moment have phone xiaomi pro that is not more dont buy the if your area are not fully covered by yet since their chipset is not made by apple owned it is builded by snapdragon and it is separated chipset which is better than any intel modem but also power hunger for apple since is separated and not optimized yet that means shorter life than series wait for the iphone and next gen when the ready and their iphone will be better and better series is forced to use since usa and china which is big fish market already use but the apple designers arent ready yet to put modem embedded on
Apple,iPhone 12,try different one use adapter or an the difference in time it need for full ch more agree with you use charger and the phone doesnt feel any hot try to keep it above always charging speed is normal
Apple,iPhone 12,went from feg and watch active to an iphone and watch no regrets at all only thing ive noticed is the screen on the iphone is made out of chocolate have two massive scratches in the screen already and have no idea how thought my old xs max was easy scratched but the is way softer definitely recommend decent screen protector on these phones
Apple,iPhone 12,regret in what sense another reason why switched to ios is that my wife yrs iphone more perhaps your wife uses it only for calling and nothing more of course it will be considered slightly used even within years of use lol you should compare phone with the same level of usage not with how old it is
Apple,iPhone 12,recently got an splus and chose it over iphone both are of same price here but tbh more ios doesnt have dual social media app unlike android there are dual social media app like viber facebook whatsapp etc you can use two different social media accounts on each app in one smart phone
Apple,iPhone 12,good luck regret it regret in what sense another reason why switched to ios is that my wife yrs iphone is still smooth eventhough its just backup phone and cant feel any lags or stutter while my plus can feel the stutter and lags moderately even though its just years although its still perform very well specially the camera in this sense it can be concluded that iphones is still has the edge when it comes to long usage not mentioning the depretiation value of the two giant company which is offcourse hands down to iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,its not hz hype the difference is paramount when navigating once you use hz you can ne more hate it when people say that once you tried you can never go backand navigation as in sat nav so anyway if high refresh was scrapped then you would never get another device ever ever ever even if all high refresh support was pulled never ever ever ever ever go back ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
Apple,iPhone 12,aha you are sold to refresh rate hype most of the youtube videos are recorded at fram more its not hz hype the difference is paramount when navigating once you use hz you can never go back
Apple,iPhone 12,am sammys galaxy from plus to and tab users too for couple of years tomorrow more good luck regret it
Apple,iPhone 12,oops accidentally touched the submit button so heres more the iphone doesnt more think the promoter of samsung lol
Apple,iPhone 12,im gonna get this phone and not the because in my country they only sell the exynos version which sucks and its bit more expensive so ya
Apple,iPhone 12,do you think anyone will read this did and it was very useful and decisive information
Apple,iPhone 12,said that one ui has more features bruh mean more garbage and bloatware thats makes the more androids get hotter than my frypan with all that nasty bloat
Apple,iPhone 12,the screen is not bright when outside is there any setting to make it brighter
Apple,iPhone 12,what is best battery case
Apple,iPhone 12,hello friend the iphone does have lower pwm frequency which makes it noticeable to users more never noticed it for more than years in my note and was not knowing about pwm thing as well but started feeling after buying iphone and as soon as came to know about it during review video or something like that the effect became pronounced for me and started noticing it regularly and it exists as matter of fact but think that higher pwm as generally said above hz is normally not noticeable to most of the people therefore also didnt notice it on note apple should do something may be some software update to reduce this effect otherwise people like me who want to keep an iphone have to waste their money by initially buying iphone in ignorance and later selling it at loss and buying iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,guys have shifted from samsung note to iphone and feeling eye strain more than that of more hello friend the iphone does have lower pwm frequency which makes it noticeable to users like you the iphone is lcd and does not have pwm the iphone pro which uses oled has higher pwm frequencythe higher the better than note so you will even experience lower eyestrain but the iphone pro max also oled does have lower pwm frequency than note almost hz lower than note
Apple,iPhone 12,too much lens flare dont recommend if you choose phone because camera quality
Apple,iPhone 12,ello does the adaptor to connect traditional headphones to the lightning port still work yes my brother uses the mm to lightning adapter on his pro max
Apple,iPhone 12,ty for the info the reason im also considering switching to an iphone from an android more have samsung and love it my wife has an iphone and loves it suggest that you try them side by side in the shop and decide then also may be stuck with samsung as have samsung watch which is also amazing but would not pair well with an iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,before im using plus im using my samsung plus for almost years and switch to iphone recently and its my firs time using iphone im happy to say that im very happy that switch to iphone because when it comes to battery life its better than my way better for games play mobile legends wild rift call of duty and pubg and max the graphic settings and im surprised about the outcome dont experience fps drop or lag very smooth and good battery life im using samsung for years and will never go back to samsung anymore good phone good camera god battery and the best part is the interface of the phone very smooth if your samsung user and you try to use iphone you will never go back to samsung anymore lol
Apple,iPhone 12,deleted post good choice
Apple,iPhone 12,this phone not good for gaming not comfortable and battery is very weak for gaming choose as more for gaming go for xiaomi redmi
Apple,iPhone 12,dont be scammed stay with newest series samsung wasnt trying to scam anyone didnt recommend anything just giving my views as user of both android and ios
Apple,iPhone 12,thinking of switching to this phone from mid range samsung phone from should make th more this phone not good for gaming not comfortable and battery is very weak for gaming choose asus rog series
Apple,iPhone 12,gaming wise im not sure mean the battery isnt huge but it lasts me almost days but more ty for the info the reason im also considering switching to an iphone from an android is because half of my family uses iphone and the other half uses samsung so should switch to iphone to match
Apple,iPhone 12,have you tried to night shift mode to ease your eye strain or reducing the white point in more yes tried all the things but night shift makes screen lot yellow although was using blue light filter on my samsung note but it didnt make screen so much yellow but am trying to adjust it lets see then the white point is good thing but have to adjust manually for different light conditions and people say it wastes battery because actual brightness is still high and manually reduce it through white point
Apple,iPhone 12,for me the worst part is iphone screen am using it may be its with all amoled but not more have you tried to night shift mode to ease your eye strain or reducing the white point in the accessibility options its found by going to accessibility then displaying and text size then near the bottom of the screen you will find reduce white point
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone or iphone this will be my first ever apple product after using android for more definitely iphone iphone is only hd screen resolution with lcd display iphone full hd with amoled display
Apple,iPhone 12,go with iphone as it has many improvements over iphone specially its screen ip has more for me the worst part is iphone screen am using it may be its with all amoled but noticed it first on iphone that while using iphone specially in low light ur eyes will start feeling strain have already posted ad for selling my iphone and thinking to buy iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,screentobody ratio with that notchi have pixel without noth and it has is some more to be exact pixel is screentobody ratio as per calculation iphone is also as per calculation there is nothing fishy here if you round off it is considered to be if you notice the symbol before for iphone or for pixel it means approximate not exact
Apple,iPhone 12,dont like free apps they are full of ads bruh wdym have you ever used free app before
Apple,iPhone 12,no its not you can go for an android then ok bye will go for android phone with fingerprint and face id
Apple,iPhone 12,but need is iphone se nd generation no its not you can go for an android then
Apple,iPhone 12,for free apps you dont need to keep entering your password or face id after few times of more dont like free apps they are full of ads
Apple,iPhone 12,you can always switch to iphone se nd generation with fingerprint but need is iphone se nd generation
Apple,iPhone 12,it should have fingerprint option to make like easier but secure you can always switch to iphone se nd generation with fingerprint
Apple,iPhone 12,download the apps you want to when you are in safe place so you dont have to wear mask it should have fingerprint option to make like easier but secure
Apple,iPhone 12,but digit pin cannot be used when downloading apps from app store it is asking for the pass more download the apps you want to when you are in safe place so you dont have to wear mask
Apple,iPhone 12,yes or use your digit code to unlock it but digit pin cannot be used when downloading apps from app store it is asking for the password and it is hassle to input the whole password every time want to install an app otherwise remove my face mask again omg
Apple,iPhone 12,my samsung galaxy from has better battery life better screen better camera and also more better screen and camera you have some great comedy material there more mp doesnt equal better quality images and the screen is nowhere near iphone quality now go and look yourself in the mirror and apologise but seriously who cares
Apple,iPhone 12,honestly dont know why apple cannot make bigger phones compared to samsungs society nowa more people dont own pcs at home really wonder where all those home and gaming pcs go when they get bought but no one
Apple,iPhone 12,great phone high battery life superb speed
Apple,iPhone 12,omg need to remove my face mask every time need to use it yes or use your digit code to unlock it
Apple,iPhone 12,agree watch youtube and play game like at least few hours day and those things do more it also oled screan
Apple,iPhone 12,best phone ever yall need to stop trolling sound quality on the earphone is crappy keyboard is not user friendly
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone maker why cant you make sleek design like samsung instead of rounded wide phone hard to grip on one hand
Apple,iPhone 12,there is none only face id omg need to remove my face mask every time need to use it
Apple,iPhone 12,where is the fingerprint sensor on this phone there is none only face id
Apple,iPhone 12,could be my next phone really like it
Apple,iPhone 12,came from huawei pro as great device but as huawei is no longer supported by google took after years again iosno regrets this phone is simply brilliant do what has to do no delays hassle free beautiful and size is just right was scared that might not get used to small compared to pro inch display but no problems fits right in palm and pocket put case protective glass as still ths is not titanium frame sapphire glass it may come however great
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone pro max bought is not to my satisfaction at all it is not very responsive whenever press button have to try many times spent few hundred ringgit to purchase its lighting cable and charger but they are not at all faster than the old one
Apple,iPhone 12,try to take picture at night if there is relatively bright light there will be reflection of the light if there are lot of lights the image will be flawed previously used not so
Apple,iPhone 12,hope apple soon solves the lens flare problem iphone is very bad with this problem do more didnt understood whats flare until googled it probably had that on my recent videos with
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone is great but it also has great crappy stuff on it which decline its capacity
Apple,iPhone 12,since they removed the charger will have to carry my notebook to charge think different
Apple,iPhone 12,its good mobile but needs mah battery otherwise you will need it to charge twice more agree watch youtube and play game like at least few hours day and those things do drain battery fast usually iphone consumes more battery on youtube than typical android with oled
Apple,iPhone 12,hi all been an android user for past years considering switching to iphone because of more it depends on privacy that you are looking for according to wikileaks if government wants to access your privacy they can do so anytime whether its google or apple
Apple,iPhone 12,hello all so finally gathered the courage to switch from android to ios bought the iph more you cant turn off the camera sound on japanese variants because youre not allowed to take photos in public without the sound in japan basically youre not allowed to take photos from other people without them knowing
Apple,iPhone 12,deleted post you replied to yourself mate
Apple,iPhone 12,same old ugly as hell notch and worst battery life and camera is nothing spectucular apple rea more same old crappy comment not ever had an iphone just hate for no reason people like you should really stop writing these comments
Apple,iPhone 12,any yellow tint issue on iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,it is not at all good phone big cheat on software app brought meodel but it is not at par more congrats you killed godzilla
Apple,iPhone 12,whatsapp hanging issues in iphone tried all trouble shooting methods but in vein so dont buy sad to hear that can you explain how it happened cant seem to replicate it on my iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,my one week old iphone screen freezes while watching youtube videos but the sound is still on going any fix on this or should ask for replacement
Apple,iPhone 12,so whats the difference between this and pro pro has gb more ram bigger battery telephoto camera lidar scanner higher storage option gb different colors not that it matters or anything slightly higher price
Apple,iPhone 12,mm why just make xmm no camera bump and get bigger battery win winwhy im the smart one and apple is the rich one
Apple,iPhone 12,hi all im from india been an android user for past years considering switching to more am from pakistan and would recommend you to switch to iphone have been parallel user of both ios and android since many years but the level of maturity and security ios has android would never have of course it can have but the developers themselves dont want it iphone is real improvement over its predecessors in many terms specially the battery am still unable to understand how apple has managed to give such good battery life with inch oled display
Apple,iPhone 12,why you want updates most people its apps to much focus on software because apple do it more so an android user whos asking why its important to keep devices updated dont know if youre joking or not do you really not know
Apple,iPhone 12,heating issues and whatsapp hanging issues
Apple,iPhone 12,screen size just that bit small would say is the new normal small
Apple,iPhone 12,upgraded from nokia android one to this very good phone got tired of hoping for updates more why you want updates most people its apps to much focus on software because apple do it some people dont want things changed every minutes
Apple,iPhone 12,yeah well said but what matter is they will not respond to any of the public comments or revi more yepit it just for the consumers really wantedwould you gona pay extra fee for ipone charger if you have same one
Apple,iPhone 12,deleted post exactly
Apple,iPhone 12,have practically tested its battery life two days with normal use for me
Apple,iPhone 12,what dont really liked on this model is small battery capacity are you kidding me more have practically tested its battery life
Apple,iPhone 12,im just an average user buy mobile phone in every years one thing that made me more maybe yes the thing is isnt easy to find buyer here who pays decent price or guess could sell it back to apple or something but it has some condition so at the end figured it out that its better to find midrange killer or possibly flagship killer with cheap price and stick with it then buy decent device again after waiting bit until price goes down fairly good enough thats just for me
Apple,iPhone 12,used to flash phones back in nexus era got tired of it now that im older though fran more exactly same thoughts as you bro
Apple,iPhone 12,go for its great phone if you can manage the price coz its more upgraded in specs and new more but weve seen this design before and this has been said time after time that the design is too cliche dont understand
Apple,iPhone 12,you know what im an android user but yes admit this phone is very smooth the animation is better and overall the phone feels light and can see why some people go crazy with it but im not about to pay time more than what have now im just saying android used to be terrible before but not bad anymore if choose the right one
Apple,iPhone 12,the undo read undo trash and undo whatever option that forces you to respond to more for its annoying and for me miss this feature in android for me its the best feature of iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,hey guys want to buy new phone and im stuck between iphone pro max am more go for pro max if you want bigger screen and better battery endurance
Apple,iPhone 12,psst not better than the samsung like always samsungs steps ahead of ios dont like apple similarly to samsung as they both overcharge but if in same price range then would still choose an iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,dears need your opinion please which is better to buy iphone mini xs and why iphone no doubt
Apple,iPhone 12,dont have other things like macbook do you suggest me to change from samsung to apple more suggest you use samsung because apple technology is getting worsen in compared to samsung from day to day
Apple,iPhone 12,in my experience iphone pro is much better than iphone the only difference is on the third camera believe me my wife has the pro and have the there are minor changes
Apple,iPhone 12,did was mostly android my entire life had the lg lg galaxy se galaxy note ga more dont have other things like macbook do you suggest me to change from samsung to apple only for phone
Apple,iPhone 12,can everyone tell me should get this phone with gb or just get the nd hand pro wi more if you cant add bit and get the iphone gb go with the nd hand iphone gb is too risky nowadays gb is the sweet spot and is the same configuration with my iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,is there anyone in here who has switched from android to ios device is it good choice or not did was mostly android my entire life had the lg lg galaxy se galaxy note galaxy and some xiaomi phones got tired of the nonfluidity and no updates decided to switch to iphone which works and syncs incredibly with my macbook air and airpods pro
Apple,iPhone 12,like the size of iphone mini and the battery of iphone can someone advise me which more go for the iphone you wont regret it the battery life is major difference
Apple,iPhone 12,samsung is much better than apple just look at configurations in your opinion that is prefer ios due to its stability updates and ui and iphones because of their design cameras and resale value each to his own had the galaxy battery life was meh and cameras were ok much more enjoying my iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,apparently you pay more to get less you pay more and no charger included does apple know how to do the math or are they trying to steal more from customer by making excuse about environmental friendly or stuff like that am more unwillingly to pay for their products these days
Apple,iPhone 12,bought an iphone gb few days ago was for long time an ios user but switched to more except havent returned to an iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,yes you can buy iphone everything is amazing in it
Apple,iPhone 12,well was an android user for more than years until weeks ago was always compari more think your review is decent am an android use though have similar thoughts as yours
Apple,iPhone 12,bought the mini when it came out primarily use computer my mini is on standby lot and shut off overnight easily get three days between charges
Apple,iPhone 12,im samsung fan but iphone has the upper hand in design its realy nice
Apple,iPhone 12,dont know why every reduction start from apple this time we dont have headphone and wallcharger
Apple,iPhone 12,apple is way better than any android device
Apple,iPhone 12,for my opinion better used iphone with gb except you need turned off on my iphone no need it at the moment is fast enough
Apple,iPhone 12,find it difficult to believe never had an iphone that lasted more than day you don more no prefer not used to play games on an old device iphone se st gen and the battery was drained really fast have an ipad for mobile games
Apple,iPhone 12,hate to burst your bubble but when spotify can use of your battery in hour min wo more dont use spotify on my iphone know feel kinda old now battery life is still great for me two days with one charge
Apple,iPhone 12,use my phone all day on tik tok instagram netflix and its pretty good in day whe more no
Apple,iPhone 12,get black or white both colours are more professional than other colours exactly get black or white all other colors are crap ridiculous colurs also it really does not matter using it you have no idea what colour your phone is really the contour is black so you start believing your phone si black until you flip it
Apple,iPhone 12,you mean android phones usually come with processor thats not garbage the gb of ram more well was an android user for more than years until weeks ago was always comparing android vs apple specs and obviously android won most of the times just when switch to iphone realised that you dont need gb or even gb in ram to get good performance on smartphone the only downside is the cost however nowadays other brands such samsung top smartphones have similar prices in regard updates the story is not so good for android except for pixel phones as phones running this so just have or years of updates on the other hand apple guarantees at least years of updates one thing was really sceptical about was the battery coming from phone with battery capacity of more than mah the iphone and its mah does not look appealing to me surprisingly the battery lasts for day and half so im glad for that even when use it intensively for day its battery is around at the end of the day the synergy between software and hardware does really make the difference
Apple,iPhone 12,how is your real battery life with this phone could you tell me below your daily usage deta more use my phone all day on tik tok instagram netflix and its pretty good in day where literally donr stop using it by around pm have to charge it again in my work days start using my phone around pm and by pm have like
Apple,iPhone 12,you can also look cool without getting the best of apple lineup plus the processor beat more your comment is very subjective and partially false and outdated
Apple,iPhone 12,do not want to have anything with the stuff that is too complicatedblockedhijacked to repair
Apple,iPhone 12,niec job apple fan lmao lmao trolls from back in used this of course im an apple fan thats why im here why you are here
Apple,iPhone 12,nope
Apple,iPhone 12,am currently using this phone and is very light portable and blue color great display in my opinion this phone is amazing and switched from iphone pro max big display but with small hands on this phone use one head to drag anything from any corner of the phone charges fast upto in maybe mins
Apple,iPhone 12,so you want phone just to play tetris and chat on whatsapp you can also look cool without getting the best of apple lineup plus the processor beats every android out there and forget about lag and viruses
Apple,iPhone 12,anybody having any knowledge about japanese version iphone is there any difference other than immutable shutter sound of camera and frequency bands how about resale value of japanese version
Apple,iPhone 12,nah what colour would you suggest
Apple,iPhone 12,what color should buy cant decide yearold dude btw get black or white both colours are more professional than other colours
Apple,iPhone 12,as per my taste like photos that have cool tone to it hence why love pixel photos awesome piece quite amazing
Apple,iPhone 12,did the chinese copy the periscope design on the flawless megapixel huawei pro seems more think you may have mistaken the point of my comment wasnt trying to argue against or criticize chinese phones actually wasnt trying to criticize anything maybe its just me but find it quite funnyironic that chinese companies have always copied apples rather atrocious designs not fan of curves yet when apple releases the much sleeker looking iphone chinese oems do not seem interested in copying anymore so far every chinese oem is just sticking with the same design from year ago mean would love to see an android phone with those degree squared off sides its an old design but like it thats mainly the reason why made that comment am all for team android of course but man do love the design
Apple,iPhone 12,yeah seems like it dont exactly know how they manage to do it but guess little more with the power of software and algorithms
Apple,iPhone 12,yes but remember ios has better optimisation so android needs battery to keep up you mean android phones usually come with processor thats not garbage the gb of ram on the is just sad also the battery life is still terrible when you try to do anything on the iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,will agree the takes impressive photos but the cool tone the pixel photos give are jus more yeah seems like it dont exactly know how they manage to do it but guess little bit of both software hardware tweaking ok and speaking of iphone its good device well it looks rather good nice weight big cameras so and so helped somebody in my family buy one even though would not buy one for myself as for family respect their opinion rather than saying too much lol
Apple,iPhone 12,pixel seems expensive here for bit less impressive spec than will agree the takes impressive photos but the cool tone the pixel photos give are just so fantastic
Apple,iPhone 12,no it doesnt havent you ever check in google and compared anything httpsw more as per my taste like photos that have cool tone to it hence why love pixel photos
Apple,iPhone 12,huawei phones take average photos no it doesnt havent you ever check in google and compared anything httpswwwdxomarkcomrankings
Apple,iPhone 12,try real phones camera like pro or pro you will be amazed at the technology more huawei phones take average photos
Apple,iPhone 12,because iphones usually last for years without any issue used my iphone for years and used my mi for just about yrs as well it still has no issue about performance but im sure it will start showing the sign of aging because other apps will demand higher performance even though the os itself is still fine same same with iphones except you may receive security update bit longer
Apple,iPhone 12,ngl wouldnt mind if every chinese smartphone company started to copy the de more did the chinese copy the periscope design on the flawless megapixel huawei pro seems to me that my phone has better specs then these shitty iphones that were just released battery ram camera storage space my chinese phone outperforms the apple iphone and its not even pro used to own trash iphones and then realized apple phones and there endless new models is the biggest scam people forget pretty fast that apple has purposely made old devices obsolete and attacked there own customers battery life its crazy people are so quick to get behind company that has been behind them bending them over for years
Apple,iPhone 12,this is the kind of things the iphone is made for so if anybody does lot of video and photo more try real phones camera like pro or pro you will be amazed at the technology that goes into real phones cameras
Apple,iPhone 12,friend would like to buy an iphone gb he now has samsung and he finds very diffi more what device to choose would also depend on where you are from if you wanna sync you could use one of huawei phones and it would sync easily on pc or notebook by using hicare app maybe sammy is another option but personally never liked their phone and app overpriced too or just get used iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,best phone ever used dolby vision video recording is amazing dolby hdr display gives more this is the kind of things the iphone is made for so if anybody does lot of video and photo then this device is the right choice for you but for other normal things just about any other devices are about the same unless youre looking at benchmark score more than daily usage
Apple,iPhone 12,are you happy with iphone have and the big problem is battery when did buy iphone more better than for sure but it will degrade as time goes by and as you use it often meanwhile newer device with better battery comes out and this device will only be history sooner or later
Apple,iPhone 12,really can not decide whether or not to keep my pro or get an iphone only use wha more go for the cheaper device that device is better as whole
Apple,iPhone 12,think apple do hot spot better teathering batteries and ios handle with no degrade of thing more iphone degrades just about the same as long as you use as frequently ive had at least models of iphones and they all degrades especially at battery and software update does make older device slow so you are hypocrite
Apple,iPhone 12,switched from plus to iphone wont regret it iphone is overall best battery la more hate to burst your bubble but when spotify can use of your battery in hour min would say that your claim on battery life is very much exaggerated
Apple,iPhone 12,currently have the samsung note really like the iphone but to switch from mah more yes but remember ios has better optimisation so android needs battery to keep up
Apple,iPhone 12,have samsung galaxy for years all good dont see why you apple guys always com more who compared mr am talking about iphone not samsung
Apple,iPhone 12,use iphone and samsung tab those all need for the next to years cheerio
Apple,iPhone 12,samsung uses lipo battery apple currently uses liion its two different kinds of ba more its the same just different names that are used interchangeably
Apple,iPhone 12,you used only for months and how do you know that it would last next yrs ahead you lik more because iphones usually last for years without any issue used my iphone for years
Apple,iPhone 12,used it almost months and here is the review performance is just great no lags at all more you used only for months and how do you know that it would last next yrs ahead you like your device know cameras are probably good but other things just normal
Apple,iPhone 12,go for the macbook not worth the upgrade be wise yes also think the same and bought macbook air now am in apple ecosystem have an iphone apple watch airpods and macbook air ipad missing anyways buying macbook was really wise decissionthanks buddy
Apple,iPhone 12,it depends on what you want if you want more customize go for android neither one of them they are both expensive and what if things arent as you expected samsung is too overrated for its display and iphone as well for the brand name if were you would look for more cost effective options available from midrange android or used old iphone if you just want to experience an iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,im using an iphone for the last havent yet charged it stepped from an iphone se to an iphone so the differences are huge overall yes it is great phone but for its price would appreciate having at least charging brick not to mention earpods
Apple,iPhone 12,should buy iphone currently using iphone se or should buy macbook air inst more go for the macbook not worth the upgrade be wise
Apple,iPhone 12,iam an enthusiast if you want for show off than iphone will highly recomended
Apple,iPhone 12,im having black gb iphone and the battery is acceptable on daily intensive usag more are you happy with iphone have and the big problem is battery when did buy iphone how is your battery health
Apple,iPhone 12,should buy iphone or galaxy or other sseries which is better it depends on what you want if you want more customize go for android
Apple,iPhone 12,in your opinion yes maybe but others value what apple offers timely regular updates long more im about same as you as for flipflop lol but switched the other way around midrange android nowadays are quite good overall more than good enough for most people androids here are more popular here maybe because people dont have as much money as in usa or in europe
Apple,iPhone 12,that is what you think other people like the ecosystem of ios people like the ipad cuz of sc more social media is better on iphone it has the worlds fastest browser claimed and it has really flawless connection to anything within the apple ecosystem it has almost everything person would need in phone same for the browser its just like few seconds faster than the competitor if by any luck right dont think theres many people complaining about their browser being slow on their smartphone lately which means most browsers these days are fast enough for most people
Apple,iPhone 12,thank you for your suggestions got my iphone blue loved this phone its worth buying
Apple,iPhone 12,yes can upgrade if want to use dual sim cameras are made better great proces more totally agree am so happy with this device
Apple,iPhone 12,should upgrade from iphone to yes can upgrade if want to use dual sim cameras are made better great processor and new design display is bigger in iphone would suggest to buy iphone worthy successor to iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,agree if you already have an iphone xs xs max xr pro max or se it is not more should upgrade from iphone to
Apple,iPhone 12,its one of the best device in recent time iphone wins you from all aspect
Apple,iPhone 12,am currently using iphone se should buy iphone would not really suggest switching since already have very powerful phone if want more screen real estate or want more cameras then would suggest this or the mini which is also very sweet bang for the buck
Apple,iPhone 12,which phone should buy iphone or iphone like because of the camera and battery more this is bro long term purpose
Apple,iPhone 12,even if you play or dont play none of iphones are worth the expensive price sorry buddy like use to say you buy phone and that depends from your needs and from your money some like iphones some like android phones had both and decide to go with ios
Apple,iPhone 12,price area nonesense in certain country battery still low drain now already man expansive battery sooo sad regret buying this
Apple,iPhone 12,if you play games you will need good battery if not mini does the job very good and more even if you play or dont play none of iphones are worth the expensive price sorry buddy
Apple,iPhone 12,hey so was wondering if should buy the or and know that the screen of the isnt that strong but just wanna know if its worth spending bucks more for better chip and camera thanks
Apple,iPhone 12,still suggest go for the mini httpswwwapplecomiphonecomparedeviceiphonexrdeviceiphonedeviceiphonemini think you should buy the rather than the xr or mini or hope this helps
Apple,iPhone 12,forget the iphone keep the xr its still real beast for at least the next years more agree if you already have an iphone xs xs max xr pro max or se it is not worth upgrading for couple of years
Apple,iPhone 12,xr is slower than se it will be the iphone xr has the bionic chipset which is really fast whereas the iphone se has the bionic chipset which can be found in the iphone pro and is more efficient quoted from apple the reason that the current price for the xr is higher than the se is because it has better battery life and bigger screen the se has better image processing thanks to the chipset but the xr is still very good for the price
Apple,iPhone 12,have had my iphone for few days in replacement of my the size is definitely something to get used to as the feels like titan of phone compared this is my first iphone and cannot get over how long the battery lasts with phones in the past ive had to charge them or times day charge the iphone once night before sleep it may be small but it sure is mighty
Apple,iPhone 12,in my country iphone costs around more than xr so will you still suggest iphone if you play games you will need good battery if not mini does the job very good and think that is better to go for new than refurbished its like bware dont know if they are good or not bought mine iphone for cause took the gb but did it with financing its lot of money but every month paying this is not that much
Apple,iPhone 12,cpu aside the xr is way better than se screen battery build etc it is great and all but now just worthless to get it new from applecom better go for refurbished iphone xr instead of new sealed one
Apple,iPhone 12,go for iphone then its great phone after all better from xr in my country iphone costs around more than xr so will you still suggest iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,already have an ipad se is out of options as it has small screen and same for iphone min more go for iphone then its great phone after all better from xr
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone is very beautiful device state edges and state screen glass looks very premiam
Apple,iPhone 12,instead of spending rs go for iphone se and buy ipad air thats great combinati more already have an ipad se is out of options as it has small screen and same for iphone mini budget is also big constraint so in new option only iphone xr falls it will hopefully get longer support as apple is currently officially selling it compared to xs xs max or etc was asking this question because if someone has some big reservation against iphone xr may come to know it before purchase used xr tried to find but in case of iphone there is lot of fraud and my biggest concern is water proofing if the phone has been perfectly refurbished even by apple the water proofing in my point of view doesnt remains intact
Apple,iPhone 12,dont go for xr new go for the se new the really isnt that good in my opini more cpu aside the xr is way better than se screen battery build etc
Apple,iPhone 12,planning to buy new iphone presently on an android device dont need good camera more dont go for xr new go for the se new the really isnt that good in my opinion if you want to buy the xr buy it usedrefurbished boxpack xr isnt worth dollars the se has the new bionic chip while the xr has bionic the is alright at bucks would suggest iphone mini same everything just small and less price
Apple,iPhone 12,can charge my iphone wirh iphone xs chargeris it going to destroy the battery nope if its official apple charger then its good to go
Apple,iPhone 12,did check fe think at ppi it will feel like downgrade even th more plastic is harder than glass glass is glass and glass breaks its really your choice though im always fine with plastic backs because we all just put cases
Apple,iPhone 12,go for nokia
Apple,iPhone 12,you got so much models of very good gaming phones and you want to game on an iphone didnt read correctly said am not into any sort of gaming and am more inclined towards xr than just asking opinion of guys that is there any other good reason to buy iphone instead of xr keeping in view my requirements and is it worth spending around extra on iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,finally shifted from samsung to iphone using android from last years apple have no words to explain fabulous device and specially software that have no competitor
Apple,iPhone 12,if its standard apple charger itll be fine im using either my wifes charger she has the pro or my charger from my ipad both does the job pretty good
Apple,iPhone 12,am hardcore android fan since when the xperia mini pro was released and transitio more good choice was using the plus for more than two years and decide to switch to ios and dont regret it iphone is one of the best that apple made
Apple,iPhone 12,no it is not the has inch screen and plus has inch not that hard to understand and plus is inch screen so even though youre trying to be smart youre still wrong
Apple,iPhone 12,the pro max screen is smaller than iphone plus no it is not the has inch screen and plus has inch not that hard to understand
Apple,iPhone 12,had an iphone plus for several years and loved that phone due to age and problems with th more pro max vs iphone plus but youre saying the pro max is smaller
Apple,iPhone 12,have always used android phones and now using iphone for the first time over all its ok but recently received an email saying my icloud data is almost full gb and that need to upgrade for which one has to pay just wondering why does apple go so low that even after selling its phones for very high price it is charging for things like icloud storage on android never faced such issue and it doesnt cost you anything for backups or storage battery is not alot either and it drains quickly mean for iphone with all the upgrades and everything apply should have at least given mah battery one more very important thing is the ridiculous front camera it is of very poor result and is such disappointment
Apple,iPhone 12,finally cheaper iphone got up to date antennas and up to date modem and is now on par with samsung in terms of networking tested internet speeds on this iphone and on agalaxy fe on tmobiles midband network in chelsea area of manhattan and at park slope brooklyn at around pm on different days run about tests in mode and tests in lte mode and then calculated the average speed one spot in chelsea area mode average around mbps on iphone and around mbps on galaxy fe lte mode samsung only since you cannot disable on iphone average around mbps one spot in park slope brooklyn mode average around mbps on both phones lte mode samsung only average around mbps
Apple,iPhone 12,one of the best iphone have ever used great battery life great cameras good screen quality and yes great design
Apple,iPhone 12,go for fe and much better screen and audio your wife has you can get the fe did check fe think at ppi it will feel like downgrade even the back is plastic thanks anyways for your views
Apple,iPhone 12,guys have been using an lg for years now love the phone still works like charm more go for fe and much better screen and audio your wife has you can get the fe
Apple,iPhone 12,its good to see apple moving to displays step in the right direction maybe in more ha ha ha sarcasm haan but do know one thing about us iphone fans the thing is we never cared about anything other than getting the newest version of iphone in our hands the joy cannot understand androids always feels like compromise to us trust me mr saracasm
Apple,iPhone 12,dolby vision is something great for an editor but not for average users doesnt real more idk what dolby vision is but if it makes video look better ill just have it on and not bother editing the thing
Apple,iPhone 12,disagree with the camera front of that argument the iphone has better video capabilities th more dolby vision is something great for an editor but not for average users doesnt really make your footage excellent but you can easily edit it nice option to have
Apple,iPhone 12,apple used to be best in built quality but android are catching up fast love apple ecosys more disagree with the camera front of that argument the iphone has better video capabilities than any other smartphone and has dolby vision is that video format and the photos it takes are little eh compared to the pixel with that oh so nice software and what not but they are now on par with the pixel and have overtaken the samsungs of the world
Apple,iPhone 12,oh what shock ive been of this forum for months and low and behold same moronic iphone hate more dont think that they invented the smartphone
Apple,iPhone 12,someone called seid got one for free today hes still waiting for it
Apple,iPhone 12,or they could put it on the screen like how samsung has been doing since also face id more that is true that samsung has had it for years but the on ein ios is significantly more accurate and touch id is much better and was way ahead of the competition it still kinda is
Apple,iPhone 12,comments are from apple users and android users trying to justify their devices
Apple,iPhone 12,in last years had more than mobile phone models nokia ruled with simple mobile phones nonsmart models thad samsung xiaomi honor huawei and apple models and to be honest apple is top quality brand thats why you have to pay for it right now im using iphone se and im thinking of buying iphone it cost around euros in serbia happy new year everobody eljko novi sad serbia
Apple,iPhone 12,like like its bionic chip the size is fine to is awesome more agree
Apple,iPhone 12,this is another mistake from apple they insist on failed product old technology with big prices theyre already announcing iphone without consolidating the newer model iphone has many mistakes iphone months later was discontinued in production iphone will be the same iphone brand will disappear in years guess
Apple,iPhone 12,ya do not know about them bringing back touch id they seem pretty commited to face id they more or they could put it on the screen like how samsung has been doing since also face id is terrible ngl android has had it for years but ive only had to resort to using it once when my phones home button was damaged but got that fixed quickly and went back to unlocking with it
Apple,iPhone 12,does anyone mind abt the battery the only reason cannot buy iphone brono battery problem on my days battery without any issue my wife has and my battery is better on my its fact
Apple,iPhone 12,display is overkill and battery hog ya know but display
Apple,iPhone 12,guysi am not an iphone fanand am not an android fanmaybei still remain fan more well would agree you have point software is extremely important ive owned smartphones and smartphones difference is huge however people should be practical and chooose the phones with most powerful cpu most ram and most storage this is also good investment
Apple,iPhone 12,its getting disconnected from cellular data randomly if anyone os facing this problem pls tell me what can be done my iphone did not have this problem
Apple,iPhone 12,issues like rapid battery draining while in standby and display yellowgreen tint havent noticed any battery drain standby standby time on iphone remains good as for display think it is slightly subjective my display looks fine but it might depend on what phone youre coming from know iphone display was cooler than the recent iphones oleds had xs max that was little yellowy my iphone is better think it might be bit of lottery though
Apple,iPhone 12,would be nice if you could specify which problems issues like rapid battery draining while in standby and display yellowgreen tint
Apple,iPhone 12,to me is the best iphone ever elegant compact and fast camera is awesome too have no com more how about the battery
Apple,iPhone 12,ive heard about various issues regarding this phone planning to buy it can anyone tell more would be nice if you could specify which problems
Apple,iPhone 12,battery life is worse then iphone have it for like week now the battery is excellent and lasts for two days
Apple,iPhone 12,ya guess lot of flagships have em wish more of em had like displays like the xperia more display is overkill and battery hog
Apple,iPhone 12,mean theres nothing special about that resolution in ya guess lot of flagships have em wish more of em had like displays like the xperia ii but guess that wont be happening
Apple,iPhone 12,the reason said almost is because of the screen so its more of disp more mean theres nothing special about that resolution in
Apple,iPhone 12,is tho do some research on the meaning of no dude is considered
Apple,iPhone 12,why the iphone was extremely bad in battery the phone is very expensive
Apple,iPhone 12,actually its only fullhd coz its is tho do some research on the meaning of
Apple,iPhone 12,it literally has display actually its only fullhd coz its
Apple,iPhone 12,the iphone had roughly lcd display and the has an almost oled display it literally has display
Apple,iPhone 12,rounded corner not very impressive
Apple,iPhone 12,yesterday bought mine im very excited to have iphone again notch is bit annoying though but yeah no one is perfect
Apple,iPhone 12,this is only your opinion iphone are reliable smartphones love the notch is better notc more theres no excuse to have notch most phones phased them out already because of available technology apple is being lazy
Apple,iPhone 12,wut thats the whole opposite brother have had an android for almost years working fine yes but what is update are you on the fact is the iphone five year old device is running the latest ios version and still runs well thats what iphones are good for reliability and years of software support even google phones dont support more than years of software updates
Apple,iPhone 12,with the reduced battery capacity is the iphone battery life better or worse than more you can compare the with the
Apple,iPhone 12,anyone is facing heating issue during charging timeif face this problem then whats the sol more no heating problems on my use the original cable and the original charger
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone pro model is just status symbol in most countries due to its extremely high price more this is only your opinion iphone are reliable smartphones love the notch is better notch than samsungor huawei
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone needs to comeback from this notch style love the notch it makes iphones look more futuristic the actual tech to have cut out in the screen where camera lens and facial recognition tech is installed is very technological
Apple,iPhone 12,how to turn off iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,am disappointed with the battery but impressed with the camera huawei mate after years of releasing still have words to talk mm mah screen front fingerprint kirin ip ois httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweimatephp super cheap price still can find new one mate pro mm oled ip httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweimateprophp afrer years with this situation of market everyday phones being big bigger can think about old products too some stores still selling them with high price
Apple,iPhone 12,buy phone get no charger old charger not work not good connecter what now how can charge more the only thing rubbish is your expectations mean its how iphones are and always have been if youre expecting an iphone to do what an android does then youre doing it wrong you buy an iphone to work great with your appletv your apple watch your airplay devices and your mac
Apple,iPhone 12,whats the point of fancy cameras when the tiny gb storage will fill up so quick get the gb instead because the price difference between that and the gb one isnt much anyway
Apple,iPhone 12,if youre looking for longlasting battery model better stick with the iphone still have more battery capasity than this one which is mah
Apple,iPhone 12,is anybody facing yellow screen issues true tone on
Apple,iPhone 12,paid almost euro that is over dollar us dollars only in us it is most cheaper than more think the trouble is you
Apple,iPhone 12,frankly its just over rated and priced in india iphone is usd phone so in in more paid almost euro that is over dollar us dollars only in us it is most cheaper than other countries sorry my english not the best what rubbish and waste money
Apple,iPhone 12,is samsung as better than iphone you guess
Apple,iPhone 12,can someone who bought this phone please write about their user experience esp battery life more for iphone in auto mode battery will last for hours max during continuous usein lte mode continuous usage will drain the battery in approx hours dont play gamesi watch you tube you tube music amazon prime videos more and do more video calling on duo
Apple,iPhone 12,im using the xs wanna buy the all what care about is the battery will have big di more no in fact it has little smaller battery but keep in mind that the new chip is supposed to be more efficient so very little difference if any
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone or iphone depends on your budget mostly
Apple,iPhone 12,its funny most apple fans know can afford pricey iphone but cant afford apple airpod so they more ok thats nice buddy grow up
Apple,iPhone 12,did someone purchased hk model with two physical sim card and tried to use in uae or europe more yes bought one from amazon working fine with sims hk model even traveled to singapore and came back no problems whatsoever
Apple,iPhone 12,buy powerbank case simple you shouldnt have to do that though iphone is honestly the worst
Apple,iPhone 12,please can someone mention your sot when on not wifithx
Apple,iPhone 12,with this high price tag hope apple not going to failed me by battery draining and expected all components use are power saving
Apple,iPhone 12,this or the pro at usd cheaper hmm definitely pro
Apple,iPhone 12,you have bran like rolex and casio choice is your which have to wear is simple choice is your more nice tryrolex is swiss casio is japanese toyota is japanese and bmw is german iphone is made in chinaindia
Apple,iPhone 12,all the features and the integrated processor are too awesome in the iphone and it is finally available here
Apple,iPhone 12,mah is this joke no you are just ignorant
Apple,iPhone 12,this phone are expensive but why the battery so small they should make at least mah buy powerbank case simple
Apple,iPhone 12,after only using android for over decade am considering an iphone this year partially more assume by this article that the alternative with mask is not simple solution httpstomaccomiphonehowtousefaceidwithmask
Apple,iPhone 12,yep even something as cheap as the oneplus nord can provide same or better specs mp more is samsung as better than iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,this phone is expensive but why the battery so small how can people use this phone for pubg it will drain the battery so fast
Apple,iPhone 12,apple is afraid to make them strong afraid that they might not break faster for people to want more what evidence do you have that they are aiming to make them break faster just empty talk as for the battery this is such light phone and nicely sized think they have analyzed usage patterns of previous phones and determined that most real world users will have the needed battery and heavy users who like heavy and big phones can go with the pro max if you dont like iphones just stay away and take your rubbish talking points elsewhere
Apple,iPhone 12,deleted post any android phone with last year snapdragon they all score between to kas we all saw on multiple antutu benchmark tests your bionic only scores around kthat is very poor performance from apple soc and new kirin scores around kthat is about difference or this means that apple is lagging at least one year behind what shame
Apple,iPhone 12,poor antutu benchmark weak battery life and no hz display go home apple you are drunk
Apple,iPhone 12,reviewing is as simple as saying well if you want an iphone you want an iphone then this is solid recommendation lol whats the point of the review literally anybody can say get the latest iphone if you want one
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone doesnt use cornings gorilla glass this article is wrong it uses the new ceramic shield which was also developed by corning
Apple,iPhone 12,tooooo costly for indian consumers not worth to buy unless you have tooooo much to spend
Apple,iPhone 12,sensor resolution doesnt define camera quality sensor size noise control lowlight ca more man watch to the huawei mate pro an compare to this apllshit
Apple,iPhone 12,another iphone nothing have changed same shit no nothing has changedok sure
Apple,iPhone 12,why cant they just make the ipod touch an iphone that would be bargain well ipod touch and iphone is different and it is noticeable
Apple,iPhone 12,then youre right apple is too cheap to even make phone that cheap unless they lower more why cant they just make the ipod touch an iphone that would be bargain
Apple,iPhone 12,have it and so far really like it pictures turn out great and zoom is more useful than expected the results of it that is theres no dedicated zoom lens after all didnt need the cable nor adapter
Apple,iPhone 12,real like it
Apple,iPhone 12,mean like pounds is mid range then youre right apple is too cheap to even make phone that cheap unless they lower camera quality and their processorbut probably it will never happen
Apple,iPhone 12,all these specs are all well and good but can you prove that the phone is even real does it have life support button
Apple,iPhone 12,here is your budget phone apple iphone se st generation since non numbered iphones ar more mean like pounds is mid range
Apple,iPhone 12,agree with lol
Apple,iPhone 12,no one gives shit agree with
Apple,iPhone 12,does it support mmwave frequency range fr bands httpsenwikipediaorgwikignrf more no one gives shit
Apple,iPhone 12,the only reason iphones performance is better is because of its low camera quality righ more sensor resolution doesnt define camera quality sensor size noise control lowlight capability lens aperture do thats why most dslr uses sensor mp at max but its physical sensor size can cover almost of your phone size the higher mp helps in picture zooming capability but does it sharp does it noiseless thats different story bigger resolution means bigger file size for sure but it doesnt define camera quality
Apple,iPhone 12,considering better integration between hardware and os think iphone is still fairly compa more the only reason iphones performance is better is because of its low camera quality right now the has only megapixels compared to another brand oppo for example the iphone has megapixels while the oppo reno which has megapixels android
Apple,iPhone 12,was dissapointed in the fact that apple didnt include battery charger for the iphone without battery charger the mobile sevices battery would remain forever
Apple,iPhone 12,iphone pro mm with mah huawei also with mm mm bu more yep even something as cheap as the oneplus nord can provide same or better specs mp in that is outdated now and the samsung galaxy way back in has mp camera also with android you can get custom roms which change your phone and makes it last longer the samsung galaxy way back in can get lineage os and have android that is record amount of updates years vs years on iphone why dont iphone release budget phone like the samsung as dis my phone btw because they want money money money money money
Apple,iPhone 12,mah almost same size mm mm jack sd card super better camera more in my country uk you can get huawei pro for that price
Apple,iPhone 12,only for people with low self esteem warren buffett had samsung schu flip phone unt more comparing buffet with iphone is useless he is not even interested into that discussions it is all separate community discussion and that is what site built for apple gift them what about us
Apple,iPhone 12,agreed its all about running with psychological peoples mindset owning apple me more only for people with low self esteem warren buffett had samsung schu flip phone until it broke he is worth about billion he finally got an iphone as gift from apple he now owns of the company if you get an iphone to feel rich you are now poorer actually and your ways will lead you to your ultimate ruin you own an iphone because you enjoy quality and user experience and as compensation for your hard work
Apple,iPhone 12,had they put larger battery and at least gigs of ram might have finally considered buyin more mah almost same size mm mm jack sd card super better camera google play also have gb ram huawei httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweipphp really better than iphone pro if dont wanna pay much than want pay under the chipset its really good obviously iphone have better chipset but for whose looking for compact device with nice specs extra specs that mention to them in front that iphone doesnt have them still very good option
Apple,iPhone 12,lol its by far the fastest mobile processor very true it is also featured with visible notch and hertz screen without adapter as it saves the environment ps apple selling their adapter on their online store
Apple,iPhone 12,apple can give one software update to iphone xr and make its battery life miserab more that total nonsense my daily drive is an iphone pro and battery life is excellent and hasnt changed since the recent update
Apple,iPhone 12,yes and nm processor will not help if it be less powerfull and nm it can endure more now more lol its by far the fastest mobile processor
Apple,iPhone 12,very nice dimension for inch but whether its apple or android all smartphones is the same more agree
Apple,iPhone 12,the battery is really bad for the specs in this phone it kills so fast because of the oled di more yes and nm processor will not help if it be less powerfull and nm it can endure more now too much power and too less mah
Apple,iPhone 12,is it support volte network jio sim will work in it
Apple,iPhone 12,not trueafter real life review we can confirm by next week its common known fact lcd panels power all pixels all the time regardless of the content displayed oled panels adjust power on pixel basis based on what content is displayed this is where oled gets its dark inky blacks from its because the panel in fact turns off pixels to achieve black which saves power its not just black all darker colors displayed on oled saves power hence why the big push of dark themes not long ago as the adoption rate of oled panels has gone up its battery saving measure but only exploitable with darker colors
Apple,iPhone 12,gb seriously and no gb or even tb
Apple,iPhone 12,design backward to iphone shameful apple this is in my opinion the most beautiful phone apple has ever sold
Apple,iPhone 12,sure not trueafter real life review we can confirm by next week
Apple,iPhone 12,the screen of the iphone is ips lcd and this type of screen consumes more battery power on more sure
Apple,iPhone 12,yet iphone has more battery than iphone the iphone is bigger phone
Apple,iPhone 12,wish to buy it at the beginning but when see the battery life one step back to consider let see the review ha ha
Apple,iPhone 12,will pay almost and the battery capacity is poor apple
Apple,iPhone 12,when it is coming to south africa
Apple,iPhone 12,battery size is small but the chip is more efficient the had probably the best battery life apples released so this being slightly worse than that isnt big deal what was funny was that they waited so long to release battery capacity after people already started preordering
Apple,iPhone 12,smaller battery yes no charging block yes no earphones yes more expensive definitely reduce carbon emissions no no dont think so
Apple,iPhone 12,as far as battery is concerned apples bionic is manufactured on nm process node whereas bionic is nm process node when the process node becomes lower the current consumption becomes lower those who are happy with apple iphone lineups battery life should be comfortable with iphone lineups battery life as long as it is used with networks but with networks things might change
Apple,iPhone 12,nice dimension but not the price
Apple,iPhone 12,relative is getting the iphone for me from the us and am in india the us iphones have more you have awesome relative
Apple,iPhone 12,design is ugly from absolutely love nice
Apple,iPhone 12,funny battery less then kmah no matter powerfull the camera or chipset or gpu battery mos more yah you forgot one thing apple is the owner of both the hardware and software used in iphones this means they can and did optimize the camera and battery to make it better than lets say the note the post processing of the photo like the pixel is ridiculously well done you can try your best to prove me wrong but those phones have probably the best mainstream cameras believing the big numbers on spreadsheet is how marketing works
Apple,iPhone 12,please check the iphone and mini models the corrects one for international are iphone model iphone mini model source httpswwwapplecomnziphonecellulariphonemini
Apple,iPhone 12,use apple phonesfrom iphone gi have new unsealed iphone gsbut this is bad thingno charger in the box apple is going for money all brands like samsung xiaomireallme huawei ar seling top specs phones for price with fast charger in the box cases headphones but apple phones with cable in the box pleace dont tel me it is about environment it is about making money
Apple,iPhone 12,where are the specs of the battery funny battery less then kmah no matter powerfull the camera or chipset or gpu battery most important this hz screen only lel no hdr the camera dudemine nokia and nokia more better then this lel
Apple,iPhone 12,agreed as an android user when look at the new iphone line up kinda wanna dive down more for your information original apple chargers are available with every iphone dealers online offline
Apple,iPhone 12,apple should have priced their iphone at instead of and should have provided th more agreed as an android user when look at the new iphone line up kinda wanna dive down into apples ecosystem but the fact they did not include charger was drawback for me shouldve released bundle where you can buy it with the charger
Apple,iPhone 12,dont buy iphone pro and pro max coz they arent providing chargers requ more people who are ready to spend about to buy an iphone will not hesitate to spend another to buy charger this is the logic behind their decision
Apple,iPhone 12,even though they not providing charger in box apple fans buy this for everything you have more yeah well said but what matter is they will not respond to any of the public comments or reviews to your notice that apple is in every social medias but they havent post single stuff in their official sites and they doesnt have competitors bcoz they themselves kill their own product for the promotion of the new one its beautiful strategy
Apple,iPhone 12,what dont understand is if they really want to save the environment then why are they still producing and selling them chargers or accessories in their app store most especially for the iphone models think they just want to earn extra dollars
Apple,iPhone 12,actually its very good and nice design unlike samsung and some other phones plus like to more sorry man but notch in believe theyve already confirmed the iphone will also have notch when weve already seen developers in the android space roll out underdisplay cameras flexible oled panels under display fingerprint scanners folding flipping and spinning displays with high refresh rates and bit color support regardless of your feelings if were looking at the competition around at the same price apples design for the new range is outdated at conception we shouldnt be seeing the biggest manufacturer and wellknown tech company in the world lagging behind but it happens because youre cool with it happening and youll keep buying it why change eh
Apple,iPhone 12,because they are trying to minimise the harm on the environment and be more carbon efficient more dont be tool this has nothing to do with saving the environment theyre still giving you lightning charging cable in the box propriety cable thats already been called out for significantly contributing to electronic waste by refusing to switch to entirely convert to usb thats usb to lightning so when your old charging cable goes and it will go youll likely head out and buy plug that is usb lightning especially if you want to take advantage of the advertised fast charging thats not even bringing headphones and adapters into the equation adapters that havent shipped with the iphone but in separate packaging since the iphone dont defend nonsense like this you wouldnt defend it from samsung from huawei from xiaomi sources httpswwwpocketlintcomphonesnewsappleeuspeedsuprulestomakeappleuseusbcratherthanlightning httpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreejanappledongleseuelectronicwastepollution httpswwwthevergecomappleiphonechargersairpodsgreenhousegasemissionsewaste
Apple,iPhone 12,its for iphone user still has or you have to wait for iphone for you next upgrade have an iphone with crack on the screen so im updating otherwise yeah why upgrade
Apple,iPhone 12,mini mah mah pro mah pro max mah
Apple,iPhone 12,it says ios is that typo or is there ios already and older models didnt get more its been there for more than month now
Apple,iPhone 12,as always awful design and as always overpriced max price actually its very good and nice design unlike samsung and some other phones plus like to see you do better lol if you are not fan of apple please do not comment rubbish and ruin it for others
Apple,iPhone 12,last year people made fun of apple for shopping phones with standard chargers with the se more sure sure sure
Apple,iPhone 12,why in the hell would change my iphone xr for this this is joke its for iphone user still has or you have to wait for iphone for you next upgrade
Apple,iPhone 12,brag about lot but what important for most people is battery information about thatcash grab company and sadly most other company started to do same thing because if apple can get away why not
Apple,iPhone 12,honestly dont see any upgrades hereeven the body design is recycled from the iphone apple tried to pass it off as new tho
Apple,iPhone 12,bruh what do you mean years old android will catch up to it in the next years lol
Apple,iPhone 12,my iphone pro has severe memory issues wonder what this phone is going to be like have you try clearing the ram
Apple,iPhone 12,lol all thanks to sony
Apple,iPhone 12,my god these specs are like years out of date do people actually know what they are paying more bruh what do you mean years old android will catch up to it in the next years lol
Apple,iPhone 12,like that they brought back the design from jobs era couple years back there was mockup of the new se that looked exactly like this except the black bezel
Apple,iPhone 12,ya yes ip is oneyearold chipset and hardware ip with the latest chipset and hardware im currently using android planning to get ip gb cheers
Apple,iPhone 12,it looks just like any other phone nothing new at all disappointing the main pros of iphone over iphone oled display for all models better image quality but prone to screen burn smaller thinner and lighter iphone seemed way too thick in my opinion the better chip and support make it more future proof might matter if youre going to keep it for more than or years the camera might be marginally better but not enough to be choosing factor
Apple,iPhone 12,apples mp camera is much better than samsungs mp ya
Apple,iPhone 12,can someone please tell me if the iphone is worth buying over the iphone cus my friend doesnt know which one to buy
Apple,iPhone 12,mega pixel samsung had that yrs ago on samsung pixon and only hexa core cpu more apples mp camera is much better than samsungs mp
Apple,iPhone 12,what about selling chipset for same price with huge performance gap still chip is fastest in any smartphone for reference check the geek bench score
Apple,iPhone 12,finally fast charging for euros
Apple,iPhone 12,for euros thats enough but for euros for gb lol how do expect it to be euros although is to much but at least euros
Apple,iPhone 12,whats about battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 12,headphone and power adapter is removed from the box wow business
Apple,iPhone 12,and like year support for euros thats enough but for euros for gb lol
Apple,iPhone 12,respect apple lot for their quality services but if they start to dictate terms they wil more they have dictated terms from forever and they are still posting record profits you cannot get iphones from different companies just from one company if you want one you are bound to whatever they deem adequate
Apple,iPhone 12,yes they had reduced the battery to all the iphones expect the pro max probably leaks and ru more some of this is true iphone got mah and the pro has mah
Apple,iPhone 12,im probably gonna buy this because my iphone is no longer supported seriously tho im not more respect apple lot for their quality services but if they start to dictate terms they will gradually lose their market
Apple,iPhone 12,huawei also has face unlock and if you check the series they managed to put that tech more there are many other sensor on the notch as well to make the iphone the best it can not only display size many other things are not available on other phone that are hidden in iphone like all those special features that sd has to offer most of it is not used like the virtual id mm wave and ultrasonic wide area or dual fingerprint sensor gpu driver update its just waste plus percent faster chip makes it generations ahead and worth it consider it is next ten and android is not even in for comparisons until next years flagship are out imagine prices of iphone and android of the same gen but this time and later android are more expensive
Apple,iPhone 12,why they didnt mention anything about battery capacity seems to have poor battery this time yes they had reduced the battery to all the iphones expect the pro max probably leaks and rumors say that iphone mini mah iphone mah iphone pro mah iphone pro max mah when its lower or equal than the previous generations apple wont talk about it
Apple,iPhone 12,will they give charger in box
Apple,iPhone 12,pretty cool one now am expecting dxomark to drop iphone from the current position to so more agree with everything you just said only problem is the video think video on this smartphone is fine because not many android flagships actually have video footage companies like oneplus huawei oppo vivo sony honor realme dont have video
Apple,iPhone 12,lmao right what can be better than crappy super zoom camera like do you always take photos more huawei also has face unlock and if you check the series they managed to put that tech in punch hole cutout apple can shrink that tech if they wanted to but theyre mostly just lazy and the apple fans dont really ask for it so the ugly notch will stay
Apple,iPhone 12,gb is good for the was expecting
Apple,iPhone 12,android phones have more featureshahaha and like year support
Apple,iPhone 12,wow this phone is from the future so many old features from last year been added come on more than stick with them and keep your trash talk away
Apple,iPhone 12,cmon guys usb lighting in are we serious we gonna need about adapters and charge more agree they should get rid of some weird standarts like lightning and random resolutionsp etc
Apple,iPhone 12,finally higher res oled screen on base model iphone those hd ips screens was joke for dollar phone
Apple,iPhone 12,what about battary capacity
Apple,iPhone 12,only ok for an iphone lovernot much to offer with the heavy price tag
Apple,iPhone 12,definitely this is the best choice to go since other models almost similar to this model
Apple,iPhone 12,battery it will be big surprise
Apple,iPhone 12,in my opinion the iphone is the best iphone that apple have released this year im still disappointed because of the notch outdated design and no charging brick but this phone is almost identical to the pro except the pro has telephoto camera and lidar sensor and its cheaper was going to buy the pro but after watched the event im going to get the regular instead
Apple,iPhone 12,cant wait to order mine the specs are way better than iphone but im still not clea more correct lets wait for the battery and some first level reviews before taking the plunge
Apple,iPhone 12,definitely getting this gb model its go to now that the display has improved compared to xr and and added features not to mention the improved chip and battery ios
Apple,iPhone 12,remember when iphone fanboys were screaming how their lcds were as good or better than oled lol now look at all of finally in the all oled club
Apple,iPhone 12,very likely going to be my choice of iphone this year was thinking the iphone mini might more it depends entirely on how well optimized the software is alongside the chip im sceptical also on all the new models especially on the mini and max
Apple,iPhone 12,will definitely buy this one
Apple,iPhone 12,charger headphone hz mp notch
Apple,iPhone 12,want buy this iphone
Apple,iPhone 12,its the perfect phone imo neither small like mini nor large and expensive like pro and pro max
Apple,iPhone 12,thought the series will be capable of recording kfps well that didnt happen lol
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,love the white iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,still relevant about battery life have an with stunning battery life but saw more to mini is big downgrade like are you even serious
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,im no phone snob but heres my opinion liked my iphone lot sadly ran it over with more have you tried using browser with adblocker modern web is mess if you dont have any adblock on any device
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,love to get it
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,everything is just amazingthe only problemthe battery drains even on standby fast more true
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,iphone mini very wonderfull device this is very handy with network ppls are saying more yes
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,how dare you what do you mean
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,how to know charge continue or not when iphone mini is switched off
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,you are unreasonable how dare you
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,those portraits are like art love this camera and the model too
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,great phone love this phone thanks apple
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,in speakers case found vice versa result quality is very good but loudness is less in comparison with other android phones
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,one doubt iphone mini finger lock is there not no fingerprint reader
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,donkey lover phone agree in redmi they fix mah battery in tiny inch mobile more you are unreasonable
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,its really bad even iphone plus is better in battery than it sure it is but guess what the iphone range may likely to bring decent upgrades such as the battery life modem ultra wide cameras smaller notch and etc but the pro and pro max is something that everyone is quite hesitant to buy it specifically do not worry about the battery dont think it would be an issue for the iphone pro max it could get to hrs of sot which is pretty normal when it comes to daily basis however its up to personal preferences as whether it suits them better or not
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,what about battery is it as bad as everyone is talking about its really bad even iphone plus is better in battery than it
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,worse camera of all the iphones youre worse you dont know anything about technology but dont care what anyone says about this phone it could shoot some brilliant pictures and videos even in dark conditions
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,huawei pro vs iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,like this awsome phone very much because of its size quality and performance but battery life is real deal breaker
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,thanks for this review fully agree with everything except the endurance rating compared to the sse the mini lasts at least longer in pretty much every test not just around and indeed big mah numbers on droids are meaningless same with ram or cpu
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,had the mini for days now love the look and feel of the phone perfect size for me however has many faults imoring tone is set to full which is very loud butnotification alerts are so low that is if they come at allwhatsapp works but is so lowtext maybe it will ring none on fb or ebay at allincoming call quality is very low too but clearconstantly missing notifications so expected more there has been updates in as many days but these bugs havent been correctedfor how use phone the notifications are must
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,what you doing in those hours intense gaming nope just some social media web browsing youtube etc also this isnt hours continuous usage its spread out over hours
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,it seriously boggles my mind about how the iphone mini gets hour sot with hour more what you doing in those hours intense gaming
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,been using mine for week now its lasted between and hours between charges depen more it seriously boggles my mind about how the iphone mini gets hour sot with hour endurance rating while the ultra gets hour sot with hour endurance rating
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,am owner of company and currently looking for corporate phone for my field managers ipho more stop trolling around lmao
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,its great light weight phone great grip ideal for holding in hand all day for social more for those wondering on video quality its great for you tube and netflix despite the small screen point is its easy to lie in bed and hold the light weight phone in your hand instead of bulky phone that causes wrist pain thats why got it also great for lying in bed and typing comments like this thought its bit cramped for space one handed operation is also great
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,am sorry but arent all wireless charges connected to power source agree that more dont get wireless charging at all
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,an endurance rating of only hours is among the absolute worst compared to todays competiti more which phone in is having screen which phone is so small mini legit has no competition right now
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,im still with an old se love that size and love the phone was hoping for simila more mini is very similar in size only thing that would bother over se is the price tag thats it
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,lol android has already put bigger batteries in smaller footprint than iphone back in the da more talk about efficiency
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,just got mini it was an even trade for my iphone xr on tmobile usa nice its literally free upgrade lol
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,wow nice essay of negative listings that is seriously long mate long but most of them are accurate
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,get you through the dayare you seriouscome on fella its not acceptable this day and ag more been using mine for week now its lasted between and hours between charges depending on my use for the day being my average use light use for me most days that translates to about hours of screen on time completely acceptable battery life for normal small phone user
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,so full of trolls here that attact apple well ios is not perfect own both and have different use case scenario for each os hey android trolls just get life like android and ios and take advantage of each both are not perfect but when it comes to consistency of quality and support hands down to apple sent from my xperia xz that only got yr android update lol
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,face id does not work with maski like that if only there was an android equivalent and since the galaxy there is not really small phone the price is ridiculous though and without charger then there is how do charge the phone if am out and about apple wind solar powered hat chargers only if someone gave me one would probably sell it
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,thought this was going to be my next phone to replace my aging xperia xz compact was even willing to jump to ios even though have necer liked it but then apple decided to put tiny pecker in it now have to hope this actually sells well so that we might see sony bringing back the compact lineup and show how real compact phones are made
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,why does it bother you what other phones you dont use have is it victory for you when other more you certainly seem triggered by the facts about your favorite os
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,outdated design with ugly notch and ugly gas burner design on back display that gets easil more why does it bother you what other phones you dont use have is it victory for you when others use your favorite products what are you compensating for your inability to reproduce if someone switch to android youre like welcome my children
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,it means that ios file management is absolute garbage compared to android it is non intuitiv more what more do you need maybe you dont know how to use it im currently using an ipad pro glte for my selfowned company please tell me how the file management is ruining and destroying me if you cannot get by it with ios file management then the problem lies elsewhere
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,reading this on my iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,what does ios needs better file management mean it means that ios file management is absolute garbage compared to android it is non intuitive cumbersome to use non user friendly etc the os is called handicapped for reason
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,maybe the competitors will also come with smaller sized phones they propably wont appl more lol android has already put bigger batteries in smaller footprint than iphone back in the day apple simply gives you small battery so that when users complain they can urge them to buy the bigger expensive models
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,lets be honest here will you ever stop defending apple products can you criticize an more if apple gives him charging hell be praising how good it is for battery vs charging if apple gives him display hell justify how that is better than qhdhz display if apple gives him empty box without phone hell praise apple for reducing everyones carbon footprint the guy is complete joke nothing but glorified trrrollll who racked up posts
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,im curious how the battery fares when is turned off when lte is selected in the settings im still on the first generation se and have been long waiting for this upgrade the best sized phone ive owned was the xperia ray tiny bar with screen which had higher resolution than apples retina screens at that time hell that thing did fit into the small zippo pockets of jeans
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,magsafe is stupid idea if want the charging cable stick to my phone when lift it more apple will be removing the lighting port in few years magsafe is optional now but soon it will the only way to charge an iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,apple also has the fastest unboxing phone the rest you can buy
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,name
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,great phone overall and excellent performance as usual using it now since one week and no issues at all battery life is better than se
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,nothing comes with it charge cord takes different size plug had the series and loved it this one is nice so far sired is fast like smaller phone so the mini is nice pics look great still exploring with trade in its pricey but take care of my phone and they last me long time had the since it came out this is nice upgrade really like it so far still learning all new features had android and were hard to use this is like mini computer so far give it great review advice you pay lot so take care of it get case and dont throw it around except to have this one long time they always come out with new one but this one seems to have everything need like it
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,the extra battery drain caused by since apple lacks the necessary expertise to bake more they have deal with qualcomm to use their external modems boi
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,yeah veey high end oled panel with green tint issues those issues are only noticeable on and more green tint in some early partitions time to call all iphone models trash those issues can happen in all types of models even huawei the manufactuer you are fanboying so much had the same issues in some partitions of their flagships exactly like apple and others btw only huawei fanboys would buy huawei phones these days outside chaina they are practically dead
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,what you say is not wireless charging magsafe still will be connected to the power source whi more am sorry but arent all wireless charges connected to power source agree that magsafe is oversold as innovation and it is way too expensive to get but from functionality perspective it still combines the benefit of wireless charging ie free lightning port with the ability to pick up the phone to check notification make call etc without disrupting the battery charge
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,dont know get it its small phone so you cant fit large battery inside however listing the battery life positive seems just weird for me
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,am not an apple person at all using android since but your list is seriously flawed more yeah veey high end oled panel with green tint issues those issues are only noticeable on android phones with hz which means apple is using cheap crappy panel for the iphone series being inly hz yet has that tint problems apple sucks only fanboys would buy the iphone series and the plastic note
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,start my journey through the walled garden during iphones launch but bought iphone not the as tge year passed it got lcd problem privacy problem with leaving the phone unaatended in repairing shop push me back instead bought it happened during the lauch my is still working fine till today albeit no protective case and no tempered glass used feel it spoils the design aesthetic been dropped it numerous time small dent here and there but still usable the funny thing is just use included cable recently been using cable as it is still in good condition when switch to even still have airpods bundled cable in the box as cable is usable to charge didnt feel that fond to as it required hand operation most of tge time small man small hand lol really miss the one hand operation capabilities as miss old se really interested with this mini cant find the drawback to be aburden but have commitment of no upgrade unless is break
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,to risk not getting caught in batterygate scandal make them batteries to small mah to ensure future sales
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,finally real compact smartphone but disappointing battery life and high price for this with gb keep me away from this
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,dont you want to be able to use your phone while charging with most wireless chargers more what you say is not wireless charging magsafe still will be connected to the power source while you are using the mobile just like using cable for charging and talking or browsing no advantage at all
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,lol buy the bigger bros you can resell them with higher price when iphone se with the bod more all phones lose resale value quickly
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,tbh want small phone but not this small is perfect and if apple was willing more just get the iphone pro with it is quite small now almost the same price as this mini
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,very nice review and very powerful compact device for these times hope this going bigger and bigger stopped
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,so if people want phone today your advice is to wait few years to save lol buy the bigger bros you can resell them with higher price when iphone se with the body of mini is out then you will lose lot of resale body in years at most it will happen apple already planned the next design smaller notch perhaps no notch at all
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,no one with the right mind will buy this phone right away this phone will be the next se so more so if people want phone today your advice is to wait few years to save
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,even that thick would be hard to be called mini know what you mean by just with more what are you talking about iphone line is noticable thinner than line not thicker
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,aaaaah this is my dream size but it must be android under rip xiaomi compact redmi series
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,actually its pretty easy just make thicker phones not energizer kind of think jus more even that thick would be hard to be called mini know what you mean by just with the camera bumps but the new iphones are thicker than the pro by lot and you want them to make it even more thicker that be tough
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,like it if it had usb port it would be the perfect compact phone
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,was most impressed with the iphone mini form factor when saw it in store kinda makes me regret already ordering an iphone pro max as stupid as that sounds wouldve been the perfect if it had telephoto lens but every small phone has its limitations
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,the battery life is surprisingly not terrible and must say was expecting lower battery more battery life is terrible when you consider that the phone will be used for plus years
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,another battery disaster from apple wish someone makes same sized phone with massive battery actually its pretty easy just make thicker phones not energizer kind of think just thick enough to flush with the ugly camera hump and let phone be able to lay flat on table but these phone manufacturer dont wanna ditch away their thinsexyphone mindset
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,design always horrible with this biggest notch
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,deleted post everybody knows you use smartphone
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,samsung se pixel any older xperias and xperia ii as king of them all but it is taller though narrower
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,poor battery life at the price of golf an perfect device the most efficient device for its sizeand you compare with an old gone golf ancient car
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,good battery life for such small cell now you guys said that the one vision had the same more bet meant motorola one vision
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,deleted post see you just go for bring petty have good day
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,it could be good without notch and faceid is crap after year of pandemy and masks inches with one inch notch no accessories gb for plus here and with touch sensitivity issues baby batteryonly insane could think this is good one
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,its good phone but not for that price removing the charger was meh dont think people are happy about that but that doesnt mean yall need to hate on it and eachother and never used ios so cant complain if its good or bad and so do most of yall buy what you want at the its rectangular and its in your pocket so what does it matter you cant always have the best
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,you suck really bad at trolling guess you never heard product called ipad mini big fan of techs was just exposed says that hes unbiased
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,battery life figures are enough to drive the customers away
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,the phone has good value for ultra compact smartphone but that value immediately more your called android authority not only copyrighted name for another site it also clearly states your intentions of being droidboi
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,extra for gb no headphones jack no memory card no high rate screen only hz tou more what great value of product
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,people protest do not buy this and support their decision to remove the charger too from the box
Apple,iPhone 12 mini,here to check battery life not bad actually still old king xperia compact win here for mah yeah
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,pro iphone pro ios update
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yeah pro battery really sucks completely disagree but for me its just relative upgraded to pro from an se ive seen sitcom episodes that lasted longer than the battery in the se anemic would be gratuitous compliment so for me the pro is full season of south park whereas the se is an episode of married with children interrupted halfway through by news bulletin the only things would change would be if they kept it the size of the pro for god sakes its apple you cant give your flagship phone higher refresh rate fn razer had hz three years prior to the release and third yes love that the battery last so much longer than the se but the pro had better battery the entire cell phone market revolves around the idea of improvement over the previous model
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,my iphone pro has very weak battery even while sleeping turning off bluetooth wifi dat more yeah pro battery really sucks
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,not my note ultra lasts full day not my iphone pro max is the fastest smartphone ever but the poor samsung note
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,most places dont have and wont for years to come you have no clue is an improvement over most places have while other places dont have so it depends on your coverage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,is worth it or is not there much difference from is big improvement over and most places now have so think getting phone now is better idea
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,its recommended because the only thing it this generation brings to the table are run of more the iphone pro is an amazing phone and think that its definitely worth it lot of people compare the base to the base pro but gb is not enough the gb version is dollars its really only dollars more for many features that could be important for most people like telephoto camera extra ram apple proraw fps dolby atmos video stainless steel edges and lidar sensor also many people like me prefer the frosted glass back over the shiny gloss however dont like the fact that you have to sacrifice some things for smaller phone many people dont want huge phones ive had big phones and thought would go for smaller phone and so far im really liking it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,this phone no good bcz very hot temperature if your playing game at the highest graphics then yeah mean thats expected from any phone and considering that the iphone pro doesnt have any sort of cooling system it actually doesnt get that hot
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont see the point recommending the pro max over the regular pro because many user more its recommended because the only thing it this generation brings to the table are run of the mill spec bumps and an improved camera sensor the latter of which being pro max exclusive if you have an pro there is literally no reason to get the pro unless you want proraw and thats kind of waste considering third party camera apps can capture dngs on the iphone and thats more than good enough apple is trying to balance making their devices more affordable so they can increase their user base in services while maintaining higher profit margins in the device line getting the people willing to pay out to go to the pro max is one way of doing this im not biting
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the iphone pro is the worst phone have ever had the damned buttons trigger things that dont want who the hell designs phone that uses facial recognition in pandemic where you wear mask the thumbprint reader was great since it was popular then that drives the designers to get rid of it crap phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,its phone not portable hard drive well you can buy them and they would be very useful do you not think
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone dont even have proper file management whereas can just plug an android device more then basically go ahead and use flash drive instead
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,surprise im back again hol updidnt you say that you got rid of your ip more iphone dont even have proper file management whereas can just plug an android device with my pc and use it as mass storage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,can pay for an iphone and they lost me as customer because want good battery more the ultra drains even faster hahahahah
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,my pro got score in antutu just fyi
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,sure when youre not using it how do you know am not using it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,mah hours screen time cutie not my note ultra lasts full day
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple more profit on iphones alone than all other smartphone brands combined so when you writ more can pay for an iphone and they lost me as customer because want good battery in the phone am note ultra user now which isnt cheap
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,however logic doesnt always matter when it comes to new iphones many people buy them just because they are the new iphones and they want to stay in the loop few for the actual new features and even fewer get them as it is time to replace their years old phone sums up most apple fanboi in general
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you have no idea what my experience have been using smartphones for over years and if more no need to talk with that androidboi he isnt gonna change his same lame talking points no matter what you say
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,these guys cant handle reality all the greatest parts of the android os are absent on more and android is the most technically advanced how oh yeah gimmicky multitasking and so called ease of use on inch behemoths
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,there is no confusion everything is crystal clear take off those rose tinted apple glasses more you have no idea what my experience have been using smartphones for over years and if were able to would show my app investment in the google play store youd see that have clocked more than my fare share of time on android seeing as how cannot though your just going to have to accept it or not for all care could just as easily suggest you have absolutely no time on any apple products and just like talking out your ase but seeing as how you have no way of proving otherwise wont bother finally dont accuse anyone else of looking through tinted glass you are the very epitome of fanboy ill judge the usefulness and quality and the pro camera and features for my self should choose to ever get one till then youll be the last person whos views consider
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,think you getting even more confused than normal mkbhd has always provided relevant crit more there is no confusion everything is crystal clear take off those rose tinted apple glasses and youll see the reality iphone pro max doesnt offer much over iphone pro which in turn doesnt offer much over iphone in terms of camera performance lidar as predicted turned out to be not much useful as marketed iphone camera is good but not great in any shape or form you have zero experience using anything apart from apple coming from the iphone pro max there was significant bump in camera quality when upgraded to op pro especially in terms of ultrawide telephoto lens
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,micheal fisher juan bagnell and others no longer work at pocketnow jokes on you as sai more said they called right down the middle as in past tense then added they still do to imply they have not changed since not my fault you cant read simple message properly
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,learn to accept defeat now even guys like mkbhd pocketnow and others have started to call more think you getting even more confused than normal mkbhd has always provided relevant critique of apple products as for pocketnow well that depends on whos running point on the review process michael fisher jamie rivera and juan carlos bagnell all called it right down the middle they still do the difference between their critiques and say your own is they are not os crazed lunatics obsessed with getting others to think as they do they are just trying to provide balanced opinion aimed at helping people make the right decision for them you are not even capable of that degree of consideration as for the cameras on the series yes it seems the pro max is not really selling offering much to justify itself beyond the standard pro according to whole swath of pro photographers on youtube mind the series cameras are already pretty darn great so whos opinion do go with theirs or yours hmmm
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the problem is you said that everybody uses fps never claimed that every more the camera quality on iphone pro max despite sporting bigger sensor turned out to be same as the other models with tiny sensor iphone series simply cant compete with android big boy sensors from
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,it just went up for pre order yesterday units wont start going out to the public till more iphones will have as good as my screen in years time at least you buy old tech for lot of cash the ecosystem is not everything
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apps optimized for ios is different than apps arent optimized for the yet snapdragon devices didnt need to wait for app optimization snapdragon based devices wont have to wait for app optimization with processor upgrade either in house chip in house os yet it isnt optimized that itself shows you ios isnt as optimized as fans claim it is
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,their geekbench scam is exposed the chip throttles badly and is losing in speed tests more apps optimized for ios is different than apps arent optimized for the yet
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you sure everyone in the ios ecosystem use all the apps on the appstore should we justify th more the problem is you said that everybody uses fps never claimed that everybody used every feature on the iphone and by your logic hz displays are useless the play should be gone and the camera removed because not everybody using the oppo find uses hz the play store or the camera
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ios doesnt have market share they have around or even lower so it means in smartphones is running ios
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,crappy photo and videos as usual oversharpened and undetailed all smartphone manufacturers do same shit will stick with my old midrange phone again
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,in people use ios as ios has marketshare in smartphone category it doesnt tak more ios doesnt have market share they have around or even lower
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you like to believe you are right and are very pushy to those who disagree you are also unhe more you cant reason out with him he worships android day and night
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you are an extremely rude and arrogant individual you know that normally id ask for some more in people use ios as ios has marketshare in smartphone category it doesnt take genius to figure out you wont bother asking evidence coz you know am right
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,sold off my iphone pro max way before the ios update but ios being buggy is all more dude you didnt have an iphone to sell look at your empty wallet again trust me you dont have the capacity to buy one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,sure if stating facts like in or in people prefer ios is some form of anti apple crusa more you are an extremely rude and arrogant individual you know that normally id ask for some evidence to back up this in claim but just cant be bothered to continue any form of conversation with the likes of you
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,oh my wordyou really are on some anti apple crusade arent you he just want some attention he just love came to apple section whining about everything not because he experience it because internet said so just let him with his beloved hangdroid
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,and what did you find so great about buggy ios compared to oneui on the ha more oh my wordyou really are on some anti apple crusade arent you
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,why because dont share your views on them that is rather simplistic way of thinking more and what did you find so great about buggy ios compared to oneui on the have used galaxy note so am familiar with the ui when was using iphone pro max dearly missed all the features and other things that androidsamsung provided would never go back to restrictive ios ever again plenty of people already jumped ship years back now only in or in people prefer ios
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,now this this is an epic phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yes it is lol where have you been it just went up for pre order yesterday units wont start going out to the public till next friday only review units have gone out to select tech media officials as yet so the better question is where have you been
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,when was the last time you used an android years back its clear you dont hav more why because dont share your views on them that is rather simplistic way of thinking though it doesnt surprise me considering the source galaxy if you must know
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,nickb nov your iphone cant install youtube pink and listen music with my xpro and airpods pro more never heard of youtube pink sorry get your point though it works for you and thats great find pro aint gonna work for me though and that also is just fine android does have its benefits but like said if ever do switch back to an android device which would be quite easy for me really have sizable investment in both apps media on the platform it will not be one like the pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,mm to cm not your right my apologies am getting the specs for all these androids mixed up still way too big though and getting bigger all the time
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,my friends iphone pro max thermal throttles and severe stutters after minutes of more iphone pro max isnt out yet exposed
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,no it is not photos look plastic it gets hotter than other android phones about celsi more battery is after charge cycles as proven by independent tests stop repeating the same lies in every thread
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,they forgot to add the price as con competing flagships are also selling higher while often providing worse build quality
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone series throttles like hell you can see number of videos in youtube no need to tell me this im aware of this issue it was ok in where many android phones also throttle under load but not in again suspect apple removed the graphite layers beneath the motherboard on the thus throttling more than the ignore the scheduler issues considering the footprint and weight of the mini and regular it is still acceptable but not on the pro if the pro max fails as well then we know that apple did not put effort in listening feedback unlike what they did on the was very good phone but now is starting to fall behind
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,to be honest the cooling is absent for either models think gsma misinterpreted the cooling more iphone series throttles like hell you can see number of videos in youtube
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the best photo samples have seen ever so true to life colors and detail rather than unreal looking results just wow
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,lord nov true even without updates android seems to be or is better than ios and while being deca more because if android update it will getting worst
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,while the iphone becomes very warm around its frame and rear glass the pro model get more to be honest the cooling is absent for either models think gsma misinterpreted the cooling in the pro model teardowns reveal that there are no graphite pads or whatsoever unlike the iphone pro expect same throttling for either phones waiting for the pro max to see if apple really notices this and hope they may install at least graphite sheet backing the motherboard stacked design of soc dissipates heat less effectively its the largest phone to start with
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,orbuy iphone pro apple watch and cheap android why well the budget android spac more to me it is my current phone oppo find pro bit from different universe compared even to pro max spoiler price is lot lot cheaper eur xpro eur pro max but price is no problem xpro is much better phone no price refering you gotta try it to believe was at apple store for repair of my airpods pro the other day they were like lol at my chinese phones speed ui and other things tbh ofcourse they did not say lol thats amazing but saw it in their eyes also xpro is almost months older model read months in mobile phone industry time system because fast releasing better and better phones every other month and months is too much usually not the xpro case because it is so good than pro max and still better current setup oppo find xpro airpods pro working with it no missing features expect voice commands dont use any at all before and after apple watch cellular esim model iphone se st edition staying at home bough it for usd
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post everyone can have their own opinions no need to be rude to others you boy have still lot to learn im just giving advice because you are not giving good image about yourself people just wont take you serious if your language is like that
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post dude dont embarrass yourself here please
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post yrs support samsung and sony have yrs os and yrs security update why you think android and ios is same ios will not work if you didnt update it trash phone android is different beast man even you didnt update all apps will still run boi dont ever compare garbage ios to android man youre looking stupid
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post tsmc the semiconductor company that creates parts for iphones also manufactures qualcomm chips for your beloved android phones btw the freedom that you brag about is also the reason that makes all of your phones fragmented and nearlyuseless after two years learn more about user experience instead of mere specs
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post tell you something android users get inbox accessories when they purchase new phone plus some android manufacturers also give preorder bundles what does apple provide in its box apart from the box and the sim ejector tool and as for pirating stuff android makers are giving people the freedom to do so despite knowing the consequences coz they arent moneysuckers like apple only thing apple cares about is
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post really so you really think that more than half of the worlds population uses android not because they prefer it but because theyre all pirates or poor and cant afford iphones this is correct if apple would release iphone where most android phone sales happens they propably would easily steal half of the market
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post nice essay for dream life you want to have
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,good that you can at least see the difference and agree that iphone and google do better mo more which xiaomi phone did you try hdr with and when there is lot to like about xiaomi but their camera is pretty bad and so is their update policy and support think gsmarena and other sites would completely disagree with your statement especially considering the best camera from xiaomi mi ultra destroys the iphone and pixel
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,trump think otherwise erokyeah sure
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,that is premium quality territory iphone is for the masses fold is for people with pure class iphone is for the masses thats really funny thought its android phones that were for the masses costing about fraction of iprices
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post true even without updates android seems to be or is better than ios and while being decade ahead or not dont know but definitely up to certain level it is
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,find pro is one of the best all round premium phones of the year too bad it never launche more no it is not photos look plastic it gets hotter than other android phones about celsius more during same tasks many vids on youtube spend more battery per minute than other phones cannot record bit video no sd card no qi charging battery will be below in less than months because of waterfall screen is ost stupid idea ever glare colour shift fragile and unwanted touches oppo and vivo have worst ui of all android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you mean that note ultra that stitched together and samsung call it fold lol dont worry youll get foldable from apple in year until then try gluing together iphone pro max and see if it works
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,vs pro mentioned prices between us and europe as factor but think the storage is factor for pro from could also be important to the costs may consider
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the reason why google and apple get those things better coz apple is doing their deep fusion more good that you can at least see the difference and agree that iphone and google do better more natural job but how is the heavy overall green cast on huaweis rendition of the grass and foliage in the snail picture going to be fixed by hdr this is not what hdr does and actually have tried it xiaomis hdr is pretty bad on many occasions and the ai is just mess so keep it off both xiaomi and to lesser extent huawei apply heavy processing and tons of artifacts are visible at there is lot to like about xiaomi but their camera is pretty bad and so is their update policy and support which is part of the reason why apple makes the big bucks in this space
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,just cause you agree with something doesnt make it fact pal trump think otherwise
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,think this is good and objective review went for an iphone but simply changed my mind in store as the pro in pacific blue looked better in my view than the blue so its matter of design preference which is purely subjective objectively speaking only few users will need the better camera in pro vs the ordinary but whichever you choose you get nice phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,nickb nov buy iphone se st gen for usd buy apple watch buy best android device have best of both more orbuy iphone pro apple watch and cheap android why well the budget android space is where all the real value is nowadays anyway andwell how should put thiswhat is the best android anyway this is where sit back put my feet up and watch all the android crowd now turn on each other
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,buy iphone se st gen for usd buy apple watch buy best android device have best of both worlds iphone not worth it

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you both have the same name how do you know its him and not you look at their location tags scq belongs to the same anonymous guy who keeps defending iphhone in every thread
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post just cause you agree with something doesnt make it fact pal
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,have heard few sd android phones able to render the game smoothly at maximum settings more at maximum settings hmmmm maybe for some minutes idk mean some phones like do have higher temperature threshold before throttling but that game is seriously demanding especially at fps
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,good phone but at here id rather add more and get galaxy fold with much more features
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,says the iphone defender that crops up in every thread defending the weaknesses of apple produ more you both have the same name how do you know its him and not you
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,youre right iphone does thermal throttle lot but that doesnt mean it has piss more you were in every thread bashing exynos when they suffered thermal throttling on series why didnt you make excuses that samsung was running on buggy software ios will not fix this thermal throttling mess the iphone series hype was destroyed after the leaks and further destroyed by the product itself people are more interested in snapdragon based devices now which will arrive in couple of months theres literally no innovation to be found in the apple ecosystem
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,jeez for somebody who apparently wants ios never again you sure do seem to spend lot more says the iphone defender that crops up in every thread defending the weaknesses of apple products in general
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,really other than your semiliterate claim of superiority and referring to grasshoppers do more the reason why google and apple get those things better coz apple is doing their deep fusion while google is doing hdr by default to compensate for tiny sensor xiaomi and huawei dont do hdr mode on default try clicking that grass snail picture with huawei and others with hdr mode on youll get same results as iphones and pixel with grass and other things rendered properly
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,in every other area android flagships so youre agree with the comment ipho more so you agree that iphone lags behind in most other departments apart from your obsession with grass and foliage making the camera not on par with other big sensor flagships the fact that they had to employ night mode as default tells you how good the camera is
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery life could be better but other than that an awesome overpriced phone my pick would probably be pro max just for that sweet battery life
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,where did your friend purchase the iphone pro max as its not released yet some pe more iphone pro may be an inferior device compared to several competing flagships but that does not mean iphone does not have any advantages but the pro just sits in tough spot compared to and pro max pro max hasnt been released yet and anything can be inside the pro max never expect stingy apple to install vapor chamber in the pro max but it can be there
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,except that the pro max hasnt been shipped yet oopsie liar liar pants on fire youre right iphone does thermal throttle lot but that doesnt mean it has piss poor gaming performance though definitely far from best pubg mobile in my iphone at hdr extreme fps does not cause any performance drops phone only gets little warm after matches erangel payload this is running at ios with known buggy issues that drops performance
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,misleading review the iphone camera isnt as good its not only the tele camera and whats more first the ceramic shield glass is advertised to offer better drop not scratch resistance second if you think the review is misleading then try to ask gsmarena or feel free to visit another phone review site
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,really so younre spending just because of tiny little bit better scratch resistant more what do you mean gorilla its corning gorilla is series of glass corning make for phones corning and apple collaborated to make custom ceramic hybrid glass only for the iphone which is tougher than cornings own latest gorilla glass victus th gen which is found in higher end premium android flagships worth the extra money that entirely depends on the situation of the customer
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,is this true look who buys the find pro vs iphone vs
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,jeez for somebody who apparently wants ios never again you sure do seem to spend lot of yo more jeez for somebody who apparently wants ios never again you sure do seem to spend lot of your time on an ios focused comments board this device isnt for you thats obvious so what exactly are you hoping to achieve here with this constant ranting and complaining yes we all seen it hes most obsessed android troll ive seen in very long time hes very comical im not sure if he understand that everyone is laughing at him
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post no use arguing with someone who hates what he cant afford he just have to justify his cheap device against an expensive one to feel good about himself
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hey apple when you ask for more than phone it is not acceptable to put small battery more apple more profit on iphones alone than all other smartphone brands combined so when you write losing badly hope it means extremely profitable what little boys reading specs dont get is that we who actually use our phones while earning money do not have battery problem and if we were to spend time configuring optimising installing icon packs then we wouldnt have time to earn money and then we could not afford iphones spend more of your time earning instead of dreaming up the specs for the next oppo and promise you will think iphones are cheap like only euros pfft earn twice as much per week now that stopped installing hello kitty icon packs on androids
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post more or less the point was going to make to this dude am betting though hell start the old im not fanboy or troll everyone else is nonsense your right though personally im not fan of any of the chinese brands oneplus being the exception and have my own reasons for that as such dont spend all my time on the oppo xiaomi or huawei etc pages every time they release new device like every other day it would seem just to run them down because why would what would it get me
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ill skip pro and go straight to pro max for the best battery life features or ill go with if want to save some money
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,garbage camera setup saw in youtube that main camera have better datail when crop in than telephoto lens this is robbery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,wwwredditcomrsonyxperiacommentsjugbnphotoprodrovshdrsourcemobilecomutmsourc more have you finally come to your senses and concede that hdr can be done well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so you are the grasshopper that complains about grass not being rendered properly in every thr more really other than your semiliterate claim of superiority and referring to grasshoppers do you have an argument it has already been pointed to the snail photo as an example of how grass and foliage are rendered by the iphone and google on one hand and the latest huawei and xiaomi look at it before you blurt out your sweeping strong opinions
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple loves its small batteries
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,thats not true mobile gaming is the future ur joking right
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,laughing with my pro by oppo find pro is one of the best all round premium phones of the year too bad it never launched in my country iphone pro on the other hand is labeled as premium by media but lacks the premium hwsw experience offered by other flagships released this year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post youre really happy with your phones cute gimmicks lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,sure that everybody that has fps uses it how about you interview every person that ha more you sure everyone in the ios ecosystem use all the apps on the appstore should we justify the removal of all those apps that people dont use from appstore applying your same logic how about you interview every person not using particular feature on iphone go invest in buying an iphone since you defend it so much
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,not really amazed by the camera at all with such high price point my poco pro can take more wont be surprised if the poco pro took better images with gcam as the sensor is pretty capable and bigger sensor in size compared to iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,httpsyoutubewbhtfzaufk note ultra vs iphone pro speed test that was pure dominati more totally care that subway surfers opens faster that would definitely make my life happier
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,who uses fps recording people who have it on their phones all android flagships from more sure that everybody that has fps uses it how about you interview every person that has phone with fps and see if they use it eh or if youre this good at predicting stuff stop wasting your time on internet forums and start guessing lottery numbers and buying mansions or better yet spend all that money on your beloved android phones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,point is if you use bayer and quadbayer of same size bayer is better it is completely more quad bayer is definitly better than bayer just try it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,who uses fps slow mo its literally feature that you use once then never again more who uses fps recording people who have it on their phones all android flagships from along with some midrangers and budget android devices people who dont have it iphone users keep downplaying its usage since the grapes are sour
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,can list different points as to why quadbayer big sensors are better what did your xpe more wwwredditcomrsonyxperiacommentsjugbnphotoprodrovshdrsourcemobilecomutmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf take look at these two photos second is when hdr is turned on
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,xperia with hz screens performance xz xzs xz premium xz xz compact xa xa more xperia with hz screens performance xz xzs xz premium xz xz compact xa xa ultra xa plus xa xa plus xa ultra xz xz compact plus lite ii ii and ii none of them had hz enabled at factory
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,really dont understand how gsmarena can find issues about the grass and foliage when more so you are the grasshopper that complains about grass not being rendered properly in every thread in every other area android flagships with bigger camera sensors outperforming iphone camera in almost every department big sensor quadbayers are overall way better than mp tiny sensors
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,no it would not that game is really demanding not even consoles at least the base ones more have heard few sd android phones able to render the game smoothly at maximum settings but it does get very hot like the mi pro some android users might have to tweak the phones gpu drivers as well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,obviously millions dont care and they will buy regardless still cant get over that in late they still have that silly annoying notch
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,fair and balanced review dont know which persons from your team did this but this is the format that needs to be followed for every phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery long last for hours of gaming and you should buy charger and wait one hour and hal more laughing with my pro by oppo
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,quad bayer has downsides sure but most of them have been actively fixed over the years with more really dont understand how gsmarena can find issues about the grass and foliage when the iphone renders them much more naturally than either huawei or xiaomi based on the sample image from the latest reviews here look at the snail photo and the colors of the iphone are much more natural than huaweis and the iphone detail seems better than xiaomis
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple only knows how to design their cpus with large cache to cheat on geekbench run real more just checked the speed test of iphone pro with sd device iphone only rendered video quickly than the sd one other than that every game and app loaded quicker on the sd device specially gam took much more time on iphone so benchmark really dont mean anything
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,why there is no alternative comparisson to other phone like which is better in terms of pric more ye right gb ram vs gb ram hz screen vs hz screen just look at the mate pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,lol gb gb ram not gb gb like phones of less than like realme spe more how much ram do you use
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the socalled telephoto is not telephoto lens but what on camera is normal lens of about mm have searched and looked carefully at full resolution samples on dpreview already for these cameras and the results in jpeg are dreadful indeed they are not as good due to sharpening and noise reduction as the results from my nokia nokias dont sharpen jpegs and wreck them do you actually do images from raw files here
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,quadbayer sensors have downsides if you knew you would not praise them do you want cr more quad bayer has downsides sure but most of them have been actively fixed over the years with clever algorithms the huawei mate and series along with mi ultra have the best camera on the marketall using quad bayer as their main sensor what will you do when sony puts quad bayer sensor as main cam on their phones just like your jaw was shut tight when sony gave hz on sony phones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,im just fair everyones curse exynos and note and you cant do that to iphone more when exynos throttles everyone starts bashing it and when iphone throttles they are making excuses about cpu scheduler the truth is that no amount of cpu scheduler tweaks will prevent thermal throttling as there is no proper cooling like vapor chamber technology nm architecture cpu is probably operating with nm cooling pad as well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,can anybody tell me how does gsmarena test bitrate for video recording thank you you mean at which bitrate phone records or if it maintains it much of the time they do talk about the first one but rarely they check out if it can sustain that bitrate remember that some huawei phones didnt from the iphone plus review which is still valid for at least the gen in my experience the videos carry bitrate of around mbps but audio is recorded in mono at kbps in aac format the videos at fps have bitrate of mbps keeping the same audio while the fps ones came out with mbps bitrate the videos at fps carry bitrate of mbps while the audio is still mono the at fps clips are captured at mbps half the ones the and fps bitrate are also halved at and mbps respectively
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,despite it being fixed doubt the can run smoothly in the same game at maximum settings more no it would not that game is really demanding not even consoles at least the base ones can run it smoothly at fps the pro max probably wouldnt either the ipads on the other hand might my point was that theres been lot of bashing based on yt videos with no major investigation on why its behaving like that and given how many haters are out there and here lolz they prefer to monetize that absurd hate towards apple if you want to read the thread httpsforumsanandtechcomthreadsterriblecpuschedulefora
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,why we do not see info about sensor size in latest gsmarena reviews pixel iphone iphonepro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,at what point does the insane price begin to remove points from the review score not saying this is exclusive to apple samsung has followed in their foot steps despite the mocking and amusing ads
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,but phones dont run on cpu alone other components like storage speed gpu ram ui et more how much gpu does opening apps use eh storage speed is not problem with iphones in everythingapplepros iphone pro vs iphone pro vs iphone xs speed test the iphone had second ram score thats just as fast if not faster than comparable androids with ufs storage and gb of ram
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,cheat on geekbench does apple really care about what some random benchmark ranks their pho more but phones dont run on cpu alone other components like storage speed gpu ram ui etc matter lot which are all taken into account in antutu where your iphone fails badly for example fast processor combined with slow storage will lead to slow performance no matter how fast cpu is so geekbench is useless other than some bragging rights
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont need to rejoice on smaller updates android is light years ahead of ios so more if agree on this with you wed both be wrong
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,but you rejoice whenever your brand decides that it will give teeny weeny update on your two more dont need to rejoice on smaller updates android is light years ahead of ios so am comfortably sitting enjoying all the further increments and optimizations on top of the already polished os
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you forgot to say which mobile gaming apps for example look at the top mobile games when more even in opening apps iphone lags behind as proven on several speed tests poco pro was outperforming iphone in speed tests
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,lol no one wants iphone like software support except their delusional fans apple gives you more but you rejoice whenever your brand decides that it will give teeny weeny update on your twoyearold cute android flagship on whim lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,who bother to read the review im here for the apple lit up comments
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,mobile gaming is the future check youre apps store man gaming apps is the most pr more you forgot to say which mobile gaming apps for example look at the top mobile games when you search google of the games are pretty light games httpswwwgooglecomsearchqmostpopularmobilegamesrlzcchbfenususoqmostpopularmobileaqschromeijjiijijiijljjsourceidchromeieutf which are candy crush among us minecraft clash of clans clash royale fruit ninja subway surfers etc the other heavy games are genshin impact fortnite and call of dutymobile fortnite and call of duty are on heavy decline so the only heavy new game is genshin impact out of like game titles the games that sell on mobiles arent heavy destroyer rpg games that you do on console or hardcore gaming desktop these games are games that anybody can squeeze in little after their work or school the actual hardcore games are gonna stay on gaming pcsconsoles because as phones get more powerful pcs also get more powerful plus billion smartphone gamers out of billion smartphone users means that youre not even counting the other of smartphone users that dont game at all on the other hand every one of those smartphone users is actively using hisher smartphone to open apps and apple beats the competition in that sector
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,youre gonna game minutes on phone who plays hardcore games on phone you more apple only knows how to design their cpus with large cache to cheat on geekbench run real app through and the performance craters
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,does your beloved brand send guaranteed software updates to your highlyspecced phone for more more lol no one wants iphone like software support except their delusional fans apple gives you latest features years late while slowing down your phone and restricting features and battery in the process technically forcing you to upgrade what good is that kinda software support
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,console and pc games are non existent in revenue and continue to go down httpswww more did the article say that console and pc games revenue will go down tell me how many good games with demanding graphics there are in the playapp store that does not hit paywall no ads etc the reason why mobile games exist is because theyre accessible
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,let me shatter that apple lovers pride even more after posting that will answer your more these guys cant handle reality all the greatest parts of the android os are absent on ios sizn jdk are frustrated that their favorite brand isnt the most technically advanced while being handicapped instead like handicapped guy watching someone run they are simply jealous nothing wrong with stating how our android devices are especially with all latest cutting edge techcombined with superior ecosystem of apps
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,bro your hateful comments need to chill its not like your swaying any apple users more and what are you doing wasting your energy on covering up for the shortcomings of apple
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post bro your hateful comments need to chill its not like your swaying any apple users to come towards android anyway so whats really the point of this oh yeah its not like you used any iphones before so whats really the point of trying to poop on apple when apple users will keep on buying iphones and android users will keep on buying androids gosh so many people are wasting their energy trashing companies on internet forums instead of giving feedback and they dont do it once they do it every time they get the chance
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone series has the best in class fit and finish iphone series has the best in class more does it have expandable storage does it have seamless connectivity with multiple devices does it have full featured customizations does it have true multitasking the chipset is powerful but only on paper in reality its handicapped by poor cohardware and ios itself where can seamlessly connect to any device without requiring shtty itunes or bunch of dongles or samsungs dex where can watch netflix and text friend at the same time or take notes while watching youtube video or live translate words from picturetext while doing whatever other activity on the side screen then well talk about ease of use androids are true daily drivers when it comes to productivity multitasking full featured functionality security and privacy in your own hands and just an overall workhorse its not handicapped like ios devices
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yep techtablets youtube channel already shown that iphones gpu throttles too much which more best part of the iphone series update is the invisible charging brick
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,samsung mbps sony mbps apple mbps samsung more op pro mbps sony is little kid in front of it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post lol it took them years to deliver basic widgets and app drawer all of which are still half baked and full of bugs even budget devices are embarrassing ios in terms of software features and ease of use rd party apps are crashing more on ios than android wonder why maybe coz android is simply more optimized than ios all the optimization pr campaign from apple has been badly exposed in the real world handicapped ecosystem of ios will never be as polished as android keep dreaming
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,really hope they will improve the mp on iphone pro max mp is enough to take nice pictu more if you want to view nice photos on big monitor you should not take photos from cellphones all them will look crappy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,thats false compare mobile gaming to console and pc the development of mobile gaming more console and pc games are non existent in revenue and continue to go down httpswwwgooglecomampsventurebeatcomnewzooglobalgamerevenueswillhitbillioninamp quote in report earlier this year newzoo noted that the entire gamin market will be worth billion in mobile will be the largest sector accounting for of that total consoles are next earning billion in to make up of the total followed by pc gaming making billion at basically mobile gaming is the future and the only future
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,nobody forced them to stick to mp camera apple engineers with their algorithms simply could more really hope they will improve the mp on iphone pro max mp is enough to take nice pictures for instagram but if you want to view them on bigger monitor details are missing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,this pandemic is only temporary we will wear masks till vaccine is delivered and applied to most people that can take at least one more year will wait till iphone pro am sure they will improve lot of things hz better camera fingerprint happy that my phone has fingerprint reader this year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,what is that battery life only hz and still performs like that absolutely ridiculous and the fact that phone only has hz panel in must be joke
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple great job
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,someone posted iphone pro with the bottom portion with scratches unlike iphone more where
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ios never again nov this is like saying you are wine connoisseur when youre just drinking grapeflavoured more mobile gamers arent real gamers they just gamer wannabe
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,if this was another andoirs phone would see different review full of critics but being an apple is ok to still deliver hz screen at this price point no charger
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,use be going crazybut could have sworn that there been an iphone out that had hz more ipad pro has had for while
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,welcome to the iphone pro the best iphone ever made we at apple bring you features in thats why we are the best also you dont need charger so we dont give you one in the box we are apple bringing you the same shit since
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,reckon the mini is going to have atrocious battery life am not buying the compact more pixel is small and has great battery life
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,selling phone with faceid only is so ridiculous during pandemy better buy se this pandemic is only temporary
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so in conclusion iphone pro is better buy than this design is better because of round edges which makes it more comfortable to hold comes with accessories in the box almost same camera performance the difference in terms of performance is negligible and cheaper price pro this time doesnt make sense at all and difference between it and is small and looking forward to mini and max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,lol so year updates is more important than everything else they said hahahahhahahahahahahaha more let me shatter that apple lovers pride even more after posting that will answer your question with another does your beloved apple think or care even for minute for their customers or they are just focused on final sales result each time they release new device and for your knowledge also there are companies like google and oneplus and maybe others too that offers updates to their phones for much longer than years even when they are using large scale used hardware and software and not some dedicated software and ecosystem compatible only with one type of hardware and theres more others dont think that giving customers chargers and headphones is waste of money and use excuses like pollution when they pollute more by producing new phones every year yes all are producing new phones each year but at least they provide all necessary accessories with it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,love my pro best phone ive ever owned have to say fantastic review as always gsmarena is my go to for all mobile phone reviews that are always subjective and love them for it ive actually read gsmarena for many years my wife introduced me to it back in when we were just starting dating and she worked at mobile phone store anyway anyone who thinks the iphone is no good should just read the pro list in this review like that dont have to buy the latest iphone every year to have great device have owned few amazing galaxy devices and they have some great positives but support and resale is definitely not one of them
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,gsmarena the stainless steel frame on the iphone pro makes it slippery and hard to hold steve jobs from the grave youre holding it wrong
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the pro uses the same sensor as the iphone and pro and thats why its output is not much different from theirs now you realize whats the importance of an image sensor for image quality then comes the lens and finally the isp
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post yep techtablets youtube channel already shown that iphones gpu throttles too much which causes stutter during gaming well if am to boast that this phone has highperformance soc it would be pain in the if the thermals were not up to the task given the price there are phones that has heatpipes and layers of graphite bigger battery and even have hz screen while keeping the prices up to par or even lower than what an iphone offers thermal throttling on iphone must be an additional feature who knows lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post does your beloved brand send guaranteed software updates to your highlyspecced phone for more than two years or they forget about their flagships once they launch their new one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone pro is not bad phone in my opinion it has one of the most powerful chipsets in the world bright and good oled even though it still have big notch and doesnt have promotion capable camera setup wished apple had upgraded the pros camera hardware like the pro max the pro is almost identical to the pro the pro has flat frame lidar and and the pro and the are also identical except the pro has telephoto and lidar which can live without them if im going to get an iphone will get the pro max or the regular or the pro max from last year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,now fandroids will cry herenow as per gsmarena reviews has performance stability of more no phone on earth can play game for and half hours that too call of duty
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,look like they cut off all expensive items in manufacturing process leaving only high specs where highquality headphones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yes iphone pro is much skippable the design will pretty much be covered with cases anyway
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,relex bro too overacting im just fair everyones curse exynos and note and you cant do that to iphone lol iphone is worst than note
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,we expected more from the iphone pro but it turned out recycled iphone pro more but their pricing is not even matching the upgrades iphone is always preferred as status symbol only
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post relex bro too overacting
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,garbage you sure technick done battery test life and the iphones battery life equalled the more higher is better they still believe in that
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,because iphones are made in china they are not that strict there when it comes to sar values more sounds like poor quality control lack of proper tests
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,video with low bitrate you mean gif lol samsung mbps sony mbps apple mbps samsung allows you do min only
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,wonder why apple is not able to make products with low levels of sar lowest are more because iphones are made in china they are not that strict there when it comes to sar values most smartphones that are made in china though not all have higher sar values compared to nonchinamade smartphones samsung phones are not made in china and are known to have the lowest radiation
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,their goal is maximum profits if they can get away with same sensor as last year they will more and your goal is to go to phone reviews comment section and rant about inanimate objects nonstop
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,isnt that taxing on the system especially with lower bitrate like we have on smart more video with low bitrate you mean gif lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,whats new its the same old camera system still weak ultrawide camera weak more who uses fps slow mo its literally feature that you use once then never again its widely regarded that iphone is the best at video in the tech community cause it aint need no gimmicks plus its got even better with dolby visionwhich is lot less of gimmick than audio zoom that sometimesworks and fps that youre never gonna use
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,as usual garbage battery life despite hz screen garbage you sure technick done battery test life and the iphones battery life equalled the op only rog phone aced the test with large amount of battery remaining
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,even worse than the
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,and small icestorm cores working at ghz with turboboost capability to go to ghz more despite it being fixed doubt the can run smoothly in the same game at maximum settings lets see how the pro max handles the game because its also the biggest phone not only apple limits the temperature threshold their internals are badly designed but anything can be in the pro max as its even the only model with upgraded cameras and sensorshift image stabilisation
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,suppose you know it is impossible to record with mp also if the cpu cant handle more nobody forced them to stick to mp camera apple engineers with their algorithms simply couldnt get the software right which is required to extract better image quality out of larger megapixel quad bayer sensors so they decided to stick with mp sensor even on the pro max version besides they had to put night mode on as default like the pixel series to compensate for small sensor
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,exactly why im going back to android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post as usual garbage battery life despite hz screen
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so didnt find any of thoseall forum of apple is complaining for throttling but guys didnt find anything httpsyoutubeutvgmjdvaa httpsyoutubelacqgoumjg
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,conclusion if you have iphone pro sit still relax and wait for next year iphone pro with hz screen and other improvements if you have iphone or older then yeah its very nice upgrade if had xs though id wait for pro think the real best sellers will be the iphone and mini and some will go for the pro max of course because of the big battery and better cameras
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,looks like some downgrade from the awesome pro unfortunately apples undoing the greatness from the pro because they did not listen to the customers unlike what they did earlier pro got fast charger after consumers asked for it now gone from pro pro and regular had graphite cooling under the motherboard now gone as well from pro thermal throttles quicker than pro worse for gaming was very good for it magsafe was not what consumers asked instead causing the iphone to overheat in some cases it does not attach very well and theres risk of killing credit cards etc despite being safe with users using pacemakers battery life was supposed to be equal to the pro but was found to be much shorter no hz screen notch is not smaller as result its decent phone one thing admire is the build quality tested it and it feels extremely premium no sharp edges to be honest
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,not for my budget
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,screen has delta of while other phones can reach sony and oppo worse battery than pro despite the nm and small difference of batteryscreen size camera performs worse than pro also outside usa it costs more than dollars for base storage option
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,please wanted to get an iphone please do you recommend pro or pro in battery aspect pro for battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,pro or need honest answer tia this is the best iphone ever better than all the series
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,this might be my favorite iphone hands down
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,my wife is using an iphone pro max gb silver with bh running ios purchased in sep used im using an iphone pro gb graphite with bh running ios purchased in oct apple cpo
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,im getting it next month what colour should choose silver or graphite want my phon more white the sides are shiny silver
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,has anyone updated this phone to if yes please tell about battery performance after upda more the battery works well being updated to it took minutes to go down percent but that may vary depending on what your on
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,lets face it apple hasnt changed things drastically this time when it comes to the design but the iphone pro does bring in new processor and improved cameras if youre an iphone pro user the pro isnt really worthy upgrade it also faces rivalry from its own siblings the and the pro max and sort of gets squished in the middle that said its still the best option if you want new iphone with all the pro features that isnt too large
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,should get pro or im on rn if were to go for get model with higher storage but if were to go for the pro might as well just get the the is better value than pro as it has quite number of advantages over the pro like larger main camera sensor and reduced notch just to name few
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,which is better camera quality iphone pro or iphone is better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone pro or iphone cn someone help me to take the decision get the
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,why my pro sound is too low and not clear same for ringtone media try putting some isopropyl alcohol on syringe and drip single drop on the earpiece speaker then play video with some bass at the highest volume level after about seconds of playback flip the phone screen side down and let the video end wipe the rest of the isopropyl alcohol using dry piece of cloth or paper youll sure note the difference
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,think should try and save up and go for the
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,is it has good battery life apparently not

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hi got new replacement mobile under apple care without no warrantyits literally more is it actually good change your battery thinking bout changing it it is at
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,pls between pro max and pro which one is better batery is much beter
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,this or iphone please help iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am curious about this phones battery performance im thinking of buying it cu more not good last short
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am so disappointed my phone is years old and think pics quality has changed for worse night pics dont look battery is just shocking really it shows health yet it doesnt even last all day
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,read this carefully anything above iphone pro max is completely pointless coming from an iphone xr user the iphone seems completely pointless the battery health is absolute bullshit the only good thing is the camera hell even my past samsung casually has better battery health than the iphone best way to go is if you want heavy usage iphone then the xr and plus is amazing if you want the quality then go for iphone nobody cares about some slight pixel difference
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,how is ios on this phone is there anybody here who updated already their phones to ios working absolutely fine without single bug
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,please is anyone having issues with the brand new iphone pro battery health degrading fast more charge your pro when it comes to keep the phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,it shows that the battery health is after you change to new battery thanks lot am guessing it has to be an apple service center
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,please did you mean you got new replacement battery for your iphone if yes does the more it shows that the battery health is after you change to new battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,got apple replacement device for my apple warranty with battery last month st ma more please did you mean you got new replacement battery for your iphone if yes does the new one shows battery health percentage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yes is true is shit brand have an reg iphone the battery is worse what is the battery health currently mine was brand new as at mid last month and now its already
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,have one in it works even better than expected come from an iphone xs you can te more was the xs unreliable think of buying one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,anyone having problem with social media notifications am not getting notifications real time
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,pro or mini if you prefer small phones mini is fine but if you dont care about it the pro has better battery life but both phones are almost the same thing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,what would you reccomend this pro or xperia iii probably the iphone have one and it works well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,this phone sucks the battery life is joke like going back to plus goof camera terribl more yes is true is shit brand have an reg iphone the battery is worse
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,how is the phone performance for gaming planning to upgrade from android to ios my phone redmi note
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,how is the phone performance for gaming
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the battery will last you on heavy usage like hours its good but the only thing that frustrates me is theres no promotion like its phone and samsung has that with hz
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,does the battery last you through the day yes the battery will last you through the day on my hard use was getting around hours day of screen on time just dont upgrade from an pro because the pros battery is noticeably worse than the pro and pro max but if youre upgrading from and below ill definetely recommend
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so on the of feb would have had this phone for two years and my contract will end love the phone does what need it for use it for work email and notes and pictures of things and still finding things out now that did not know mine is the which is fine came from xr phone and that was also great phone in fact am not sure why wanted flagship phone in first place dont think will upgrade to the or or even the as it does what need scan documents with it and use social media and banking apps it works fine only ever used the lidar sensor few times to be honest forget it is there and shortcuts once its solid phone build is good with the latest updates it can only get better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,anyone have same problem with telephoto not focusing seems like fixed focus
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ive had the iphone pro since shortly after it was released theres truly only more its only in the pro models of the and that has hz it doesnt fully use the hz it can go as high as hz and go as low as hz when you dont need high refresh ratepro tip its called pro motion which can save you battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,if you like the overall ios experience go with the iphone honestly sony is dying brand on more dont agree with you have sony xperia and it is very good phone one of the best
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,honestly wait for bit and get the pro trust me the hz screen will be worth the upgr more thanks
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,jave xs and thinking about upgrading to pro since you used both do you think its worth more honestly wait for bit and get the pro trust me the hz screen will be worth the upgrade the telephoto on the pro is also an added bonus
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,try it was hardcore android user and now cant go back the quality is all there in ip more jave xs and thinking about upgrading to pro since you used both do you think its worth it how is battery and camera compared my concern is maybe should wait for another year and go for pro just because of hz display buying it on second hand market
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,still im using this phone its still fast and camera is still very good video as well battery will get through day im not playing any games on it its only email chats phone calls had battery health
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so long term use of iphone pro and love it have had android and windows phone to be honest cant get excited by the or with only few changes really no point come out of contract next june am going to puck my number over someone cheaper unless apple change the design or upgrade mind blowing will stick with what have got my mate has the max and held it seemed so large and thought would like phone mean bigger screen better for games but dont play games on the ipad so probably wont bother but the other day had to sort out my dads andriod phone it felt so alien to me know it took me ages to find things on it no think will stick with apple it just works
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hey need help between galaxy and iphone pro which should get thanks in advance if you are with camera and large screen go for galaxy ultra camera is awsome playing games is also smooth battery is also good and it has spen
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,im deciding if should go for this and sell my recent motorola edge ultra want to try more try it was hardcore android user and now cant go back the quality is all there in iphones started with xs now have pro then again dont see any difference from one and another only speed on opening apps and speakers so you decide what you want
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hi all im looking at second hand of iphone pro and pro max as the price is very near do you guys mind recommending which should go for if its only the large screen size then will go for the less bulky iphone pro heard iphone pro battery kinda bad
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,can anyone give more feedback regarding battery life today if choose to buy this model more buy the iphone pro you will not regret it the battery is great
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yes let me elaborate have been an android user for years but recently moved to ios and bought an iphone pro honestly think it was the best decision of my life bought second hand phone with battery health but still dont have to charge my phone before to hours with moderate usage with bluetooth wifi always on in short the android was better in term of open environment but the iphone is much much better in every other aspect
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yeah the iphone pro camera is far better than no it literally isnt lmao the has larger sensor larger pixels and sensor shift image stabilisation
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am experiencing difficult that all apps not working properly visited one of service center they formatted my iphone and give back result lost all my data problem still exist then contacted customer care through chat two times they said some procedures when complete that problem will be solved but after sometimes problem again came very bad experience from iphone team
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,should get an iphone pro if upgrade from ip mean see it like reasonable chang more its wise choice
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,need advise here which one is better between iphone pro and iphone considering th more yeah the iphone pro camera is far better than
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hi which is better samsung galaxy as or phone pro am using android system and more iphone pro should last at least years longer it is vastly faster than in as however battery life is better on as camera is subjective as as is more poppy and saturated while pro is realistic personally prefer no notch and hz headphone jack on as
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,people say this was small upgrade but just noticed that they actually increased both the storage and the ram more for the same price
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,because of the better camera battery life and performance do you mean the camera on iphone is better than iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,best battery phone but should include battery charger besides huge amount of purchasing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ios is out at about mb at local time
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ios public is out
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,better in what how is the pro better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,looking to upgrade my iphone and im wondering if this is worth it or should wait for the more if you got the money go for it unless your is broken or the battery has degraded severely would just stay where you are
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,is that even question absolutely go for the iphone pro smart and active
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,is out now
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,why it doesnt have zoom like pro max its great size but that zoom would had made it even better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ios is rolling out at over mb at pm local
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,got the iphone pro silver last march but the battery dropped down to already tt have similar experience too bought silver iphone pro max last year and my battery is already im confused too honestly
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,have migrated from iphone to iphone pro weeks ago what disappointment the iphon more if the fingerprint reader is the top of your ambitions then do your self favor and go get iphone se or just stick to your oldie
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont buy pro its unable to updat its stuck and the millions who updated already
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hi the chip in the pro is battery saving light kind of chip if that makes sense its not more best chip in the market in terms of performance and efficiency then someone like you pops up out of no where claiming its not for gaming dude do us favor and read bit before coming here posting useless comments
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hi hi ive got iphone pro and am not happy with it well its phone is overheating more hi the chip in the pro is battery saving light kind of chip if that makes sense its not built for gaming just general use
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,im bus driver use this phone frequently after hours of shift when get home sti more eat eggs for breakfast hours have past from charge use it frequently battery is have android phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,pro is very nice compecthandy phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ios downloading coming in at almost mb
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,bought it yesterdayits beautiful phonecant wait to try all that it can do and new ios will buy some airtags as well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,please comment whats better iphone pro or if you are not into very low light photos pro is great super battery as well and cheaper
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,give me your opinion please is pro better or they have the same price pro is incredibly nice it works perfectly fine with no problems but the pro max got better endurance than the which is an excellent improvement from the pro series
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am sure some of you guys here are youtuber and you are going to publish my experimentas soon as you have done it yourselves and here we go own pro just brought one of those apple crysta magsafe compatible cases for my phone did some experiment and you may try it too at home and iam sure you guys will be surprised put on my crystal case and tried to wire chargin my phone from up to minutes exactly in order to check how many percent will my charger do in that time frames so with the case on my phone was charger from to in minutes to be exact and without the magnetic case to in minutes yes thats right the magnetic iphone case slows down the charging speed for sure witch have been suspected from long time ago since bought the case have no doubt now that all those magnetic compatible apple cases slows down the charging speed by in every minutes try it yourselves good luck
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,im thinkig to bay this one just one question for owners only how long batery lasting more im bus driver use this phone frequently after hours of shift when get home still have left of battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,better then pro hahahaha never you never had pro even today if we compare iphone pro with pro huawei will win stop spreading some untrue thoughts it doesnt make any sense
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so how is the update any issues after the update any improvements after the update for me the video stuttering bug on fb messenger was fixed im just thinking to upgrade to iphone pro but still hessitant coz many people says not worth the money from pro to pro any suggestions
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,was afraid of the battery after seeing multiple reviews and battery tests took the chance more thanks alot man your feed back really helped was so worried about the battery reviews of the pro like seriously contemplating weather to get the max or probut with your feedback think the pro is nearly perfect phone and am gonna get one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so hows the update anyone please any issues
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone iphone battery for video playback hours hours battery for audio playback more sorry to break it to you but this comment needs to be deleted this is is too much misunderstanding not sure why if youre here to hate but please dont talk so garbage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,removing charger and ear pods doesnt make any sense
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,next step is with same width same ppi ok but why though
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,excuse me price my god for phone with mp camera jesus christ in more also the mp is still better than the pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,mp and yet it still takes better photos than the pro dont listen to this guy he literally misleading himself which is not big deal to agree with that guy so suggest you to go with the iphone pro max or pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,just have question bought the iphone pro model from malaysia does it support cdma since it doesnt have meid
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post it will only be discontinued which you can probably buy from thirdparty stores as for the iphone yes it seems like the iphone pro variants could likely have hz ltpo displays oh and portrait video mode are coming to iphone but limited to the pro models
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,that screen that battery the price okay really like optimization in ios and the gb ram in it feels more faster than previous iphones and especially the cameras are great
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ive used this phone week and the battery is enough to last the whole day with normal usage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone only cable charger included no more no less how can charge without the charge more would say that the headphones and charger are sold separately which is not bad for the environment also would not say that this company is trash they are some disgraceful tech reviewers who says the same thing every year here is deal dont listen to these people
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yes everything is ok except still no news about under display touch id happening this ip more probably because of ming chi kuo
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,my first iphone love it so much compare to my previous android phone especially the camera the best
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,samsung phones have an app called device care which has several features including battery and more yes know about the device care app that comes with all samsung devices but what know how old is my battery and what is my current battery health percentage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont worry youll probably get the pro max soon as it would have touch id aod more yes everything is ok except still no news about under display touch id happening this iphone series specially the pro versions
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,if you have trash low end android model phone surely you cannot such feafure now buy high more youve completely misunderstood the guy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,flagship phone and its got only fast charging cmon apple not even lightning instead of usbc is grinding my gears as much as this
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,have question to ask what is iphone battery health meter and why android phones don more if you have trash low end android model phone surely you cannot such feafure now buy high end model and you will see there the one you are looking for next time dont be bias if you dont owned one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,when all the companies are working on sleek phoneswht iphone everytime making more bulky and wide phones once they lauched iphone and series light and sleek phones even today many people are using them but now they are make things heavy wide and ugly
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,cant believe someone who has right hahahah
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,believe samsung galaxy watch support to iphones too just need to install samsung health more yes it does also work with ios but apparently not all features are compatible have checked with the telstra shop and was told that many features may be missing im really not that concerned though because my is very good really just looking for change and nothing more
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,know another months time we are able to witness the iphone series launch event more believe it or not this years iphone will likely to have these improvements over the last years but remains unchanged for the size if youre looking for new iphone this year you have to wait till the end of
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,not even year only few months know another months time we are able to witness the iphone series launch event but new phone cost high price and thats why mention wait for another year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,wait for another year and buy the iphone pro that will comes with good specs hz more not even year only few months
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,love iphone pro im hoping that one day will get one wait for another year and buy the iphone pro that will comes with good specs hz ltop display smaller notch bigger battery improved camera setup
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,nice to hear good thoughts about iphones am android user and willing to buy iphone more have an and love it but may have considered the new iphone when it is released however am tied to samsung due to my excellent samsung galaxy watch so will probably be looking at the upon its release
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,also is the magsafe cases and usbs has bad effect on battery health
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,just returned my iphone and replaced with iphone pro base model in silver colour which more nice to hear good thoughts about iphones am android user and willing to buy iphone series device have never used iphone device in my life if bought iphone will use years at least
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,really appreciated the article and the facts interlaced with your opinions tend to agree with you recently switched to iphone pro due to various reasons and when discovered that apple music was going to be hd lossless got excited however have discovered that the iphone pro device only supports bit khz output via the lightning connector so if understand correctly can get hz to khz audio sounds from the phone via the builtin speakers or via the lightning port that pretty much limits the additional depth that would be available to influenceimprove the lower audible frequencies in the music think its great that we can get lossless for purchasingarchival purposes recently had my hearing checked and unfortunately can only hear solidly up to khz but it is spotty going up to khz anything above that cannot hear in side by side test cannot tell the difference between the mp version and the flac version of ariana grandes rings or other hd spatial audio songs so for me whether there is factual proof or not it doesnt matter hopefully the rest of your readers have better hearing and can actually benefit from the lossless audio oh and btw yes am listening through sh hd and fiio dac maybe not the best setup but would think sufficient
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,found out today that ios is like android apps are now starting up automatically when bluetoot more you must have messed up the automation settings there are automations on ios where you can allow things to happen on trigger like wifi connects bluetooth connects by default apple doesnt allow rd party automations but this can now be changed in settings and you must added wrong automation from the web go and delete it and please dont accept any thing an unknown site asks for
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,everyone says iphones have the best camera on the market the answer the software is overpr more the software is overprocessing the photos likes pixels that only have good photos because of their processing seethe cope even
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,they removed the charging brick and headphones same goes for samsung you now have to pay ex more cant believe someone who has right
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,what is the difference between international vs middle east version of iphone pro or iphone pro max there is slight price ingress for the international version
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,worst apple product ive ever had my first was contacts dont sync or duplic more this is getting really old but just because its worse product doesnt mean its worse so you gotta go whichever has the right choice for you to consider
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,new phone is elegant and pleasing thanks for sharing really appreciate it but dont really understand why people complain about the iphones camera details even though it looks versatile to some users so why people are concerned about this at first it was decent now they keep complaining about iphones camera details for that matter if youre having trouble with the iphones camera details please get your new iphone checked to see if the issues are there or not
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,finaly person who has different opinions with no regrets so hows your new iphone new phone is elegant and pleasing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,absolutely stunning worth buying and incredible experience finaly person who has different opinions with no regrets so hows your new iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yeah samsung is way more better than iphone apple has fixed the issue twice when the tracking transparency is grayed out in and
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,okay dude keep downloading viruses the only legit way is to actually pay yes if someone can spend bucks on an iphone am sure they can afford to spend to bucks on moving whatsapp from android to ios
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,when you buy iphone pro or iphone pro max what comes with it does it includes headset more they removed the charging brick and headphones same goes for samsung you now have to pay extra the box contains the phone usbc cable apple sticker and sim card remover
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont give wrong info check on youtube there are apps like dr fone etc that can help just more okay dude keep downloading viruses the only legit way is to actually pay
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,there is no solution you have to start off with clean slate dont give wrong info check on youtube there are apps like dr fone etc that can help just see the videos to understamd the process to move whatsapp pls understand there might be people using whatsapp on android for plus yrs and now they need to suddenly switch to ios and need all their chats from android to move to ios
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hey man have the same issue did you resolve it anyhow im sorry but your messages are lost forever if you used the same sim the phone numbers are probably on your new device now so you have to start new chats
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so which version has the better battery life or pro or are they about even endurance rating on the pro and endurance rating on the pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hey man did find the solution there is no solution you have to start off with clean slate
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,whattsapp messages can not be transferred between iphone and android recently made the swic more hey man have the same issue did you resolve it anyhow
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,in my opinion the pro max offers better value because you are getting better battery life bigger and better camera system and larger display if you like the smaller option stick with the pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,can anyone reply to this whattsapp messages can not be transferred between iphone and android recently made the swich androidiphone and the messages are not recoverable sorry
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hi there auto brightness has swear problem just got one pro and on auto brightness more connect itunes and update
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hello want to ask have iphone pro use original iphone charger notice that when charge it the telephone heats very much the heat goes to the display is this normal
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,does the paint chips of the stainless steel frame of iphone pro is there specific problem more didnt hear about that but if you actually want to get an iphone and worried about such things its always safest to go for silver
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,which color is elegent and premium between silver and white am looking for one of them can more both can be seen as elegant or premium guess would say find pictures of both colours you like and really look at themsee which represents you or your style the most but there is also always the route of working out what cases you like too then seeing which colour goes with more cases styles etc myself went for red standard iphone because am have had bright bold colour before then got lime green casejust to be the total opposite of what usually go for you want elegance and premium wanted powerful vivid colour that would make me smile but am also looking at skins for the phone to up the colour game
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,anyone else suffering with very hot devices cant work out if it is software related my device gets very warm when playing games like coin master for mins and the battery is shockingly bad when the device warms up never had this issue with the pro also when it switches between and sometimes the internet stops working and the phone freezes for while believe low signal also drains the battery and makes the device very warm noticed that the majority of the heat is at the back close to where the cameras are hopefully its not just my device and apple can sort it with an update
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,fact lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,its probably gonna be very surprising for you but you know iphone is phone and macbo more have iphone pro and macbook inch
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,which is better iphone pro or samsung ultra looking for better camera and performance iphone pro samsung ultra
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am unable to use swipe gesture for back how to activate it by swiping left or right on the white line down you can go between the pages you recently opened hope that helps
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,have and im going to upgrade to either pro or pro which would you recommend lidar more have iphone pro fantastic phone lasts full day battery very good and charges fast the different the
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,very good very fast its imagine fully satisfied
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,gb ram in an iphone would perform better than gb on an android fact
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphones are the best
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,perhaps personally never had an iphone so dont know but you maybe youre right would not say am right everyone has their own tasteopinion when it comes to this tbh
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,think ios makes apps better as far as my experience goes perhaps personally never had an iphone so dont know but you maybe youre right
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,guess youre right about that one but from what know their optimization more think ios makes apps better as far as my experience goes
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,oh and they have better hardware integration and they can easily find out what has to optimise more guess youre right about that one but from what know their optimization downgrades apps and perhaps even closes other apps when only in background to conserve the ram
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,yes but this does not need that much ram due to the tight integration as far as my knowledge goes oh and they have better hardware integration and they can easily find out what has to optimised since they are only working with one set of phones ur free to correct me on anything and add on to what said
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,that could mostly depend on use cases if youre multitasker more ram is still btter yes but this does not need that much ram due to the tight integration as far as my knowledge goes
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,or just dont be poor and buy both bruh thats exactly the same as telling blind person to look or not be bilnd
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,just look at all the professional isheeeple here
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,gb and only gb ram instead off gb ram what ripoff gb ram in an iphone would perform better than gb on an android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,living in tanzania bought iphone pro gb yesterday very nice phone nice camera gr more have too everything you wrote is true
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont buy iphone pro instead of iphone pro go for macbook macbooks are great with more its probably gonna be very surprising for you but you know iphone is phone and macbook is computer
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,its not case of being poor or notiphones are not symbol of wealth more sym more hahaha
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,its been over month since bought and used this phone on daily basis honestly do not have problem with it its compact fast and reliable my iphone pro max had better battery for sure but the iphone pros battery is more than enough for me also switching between apps while keeping them running in the background is noticeably better on the pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone camera flicker on video recording pro with update making video in the dark with flash the same problem with at fps the video flashes and many light sources make noise on the screen youtubecomwatchverstiwbjg youtubecomwatchvvqmyirofgu youtubecomwatchvnvsxqmyu
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,good phone but have noticed the device does get very warm when doing certain things like vi more all phones are same lol later you can get high end android phone and just try playing some games and render some videos then you can see
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,my first iphone pro and got disappointed by the camera quality my previous phones xp more buy nikon camera
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,usage battery at screen included about mail weather forecast facebook notifications about minutes of talk time have mobile phone for days the battery is solid for me
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,mah what joke euros ticket energy efficiency am proud of iphone it battery life last longer than android phones with more battery capacity

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,please presently thinking of getting the gold iphone pro please how does it look the gold one is too gaudy when saw the demo unit on the apple store the good looking pro models are the graphite and blue colors bought the graphite one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,or gb iphone pro which that depends on what do if normal user would suggest either gb or gb cant seem to find reason to have gb version unless take lot of video
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,superb phone dont believe all these bs comments if there was problem with your phone appl more or gb iphone pro which
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,days since its arrived can say its very very handy came from ipplus and xsmax this is new to me and love it

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,couple days ago switched to the pro from the and im pleasantly surprised at the impr more please presently thinking of getting the gold iphone pro please how does it look
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,new iphone max suddenly will not charge although have two different chargers and extra lightning cables im in the province so its all day trip back to seller seller does back room magic returns saying problem was inserted the lightning cable upside down my bs meter goes off the scale know this was not the problem also have topnotch otterbox case for my iphone which is also advertised as waterproof next my waterproof iphone protected with waterproof otterbox case living in my dry pants pocket suddenly will not charge again why the error message is liquid detected in the lightning connector once again my bs meter goes off the charts so sorry bot iphone big expensive time burning mistake hope this is not you too
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,no charger in the box end of the road welcome to capitalism
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,very disappointed this time returned the iphone pro and went back to pro too expensive no charger and headphone and bad battery life really believe that apple should reconsider the price target especially nowadays
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,think all of the iphone were missed opportunities if they had more competitive sp more camera mp count doesnt matter pixel binning is rubbish id rather sensor was inch with max mp for good size pixel site mp is overkill for sucky little sensor if youre fine with so so fine detail and not really doing much with your images then any camera will dobut pixel binning is and will always be rubbish
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,charles it with my ipad charger no problem dont need always on display or any led notifi more using an apple watch or any apple device isnt flex
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,will lett see mah baterrywhats thata joke hmhow to charles it with finger or more charles it with my ipad charger no problem dont need always on display or any led notification because use apple watch flexes
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the mp sensors are unnecessary because if use those or mp modes they look softer more oh and hole punch cameras are super dumb and just straight up interrupt the screen and do not think the notch is going away cus they pretty much locked in on face id the ram is not that necessary can do perfectly fine with gigs and they pretty much made the entire iphone keynote verizon ad so ya even att wont stop talking about them having the thing lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,heyum am android user want to switch to iphone but dont know which is worth to more am from android too bought iphone pro very satisfied with the phone battery life is not an issue for me so have both android and iphone together my android phones that still used are huawei mate and xiaomi redmi note you will feel premium feelings for the flagship phone just buy with plan instead of cash
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the reason for this release is just to increase the price too expensive for no features
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,between iphone pro and iphone pro max which one would be better choice depends on you pro max if size doesnt matter you get bigger battery and newer and better sensor pro if pixel density of screen matters this seems the perfect size personally out of the and more worth if your just usual user and not media hub
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont go for any of them tells you now iphone is bit strong
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,worst design price more than double high side
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,just tried an iphone pro what an incredibly clunky piece of hardware it looks and feels more what load of crap you just wrote about iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,feel like just to wait for ip think they will upgrade the camera from mp ip maybe the battery and ip for maybe teardrop notch
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,since the xs max did not upgrade to the pro just got my hands on the pro and must say its piece of art feels like slab of glass in your hands and the quality of the product from the touch and feel to the display and the cameras is just perfect remember the feeling when first had my and thought it cant get any better than this and here we are with the pro setting bar to what the new age phones in should be like no doubt it is the absolute device to have in your pocket for day the pro max just felt too big and unpractical for daily quick use and buy xl gloves so my hands are considered fairly big
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,see lot of people here whining about specs and price it is simple people you dont more will lett see mah baterrywhats thata joke hmhow to charles it with finger or something else led notificationnoalways on displaynowell smart people who own iphone new whats is coming newdisplay inchthat size is for iphone pro enafwell half inch is noch so it inchmade by lguntill nowand now display made some now name factory in chinaand then send to another factory to finich whole phonein china of course telefofoto zoom stupid huawei made pro and pro zoom earphonesnowho need that you can imagine how its sound thru eaphoneslive wallpaper on home screennoof coursechange icon sizenoput new theme for home sreen to change look of phonenowell some stupid phone with price of in europe realy can made and offer only iphone enoy in pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,right im using iphone pro max nightgreen love my phone never used any android till date well im using iphone since very much satisfied with iphones features but this time im really disappointed with their new selling scheme as theyre not providing any charger or headphone im not going to buy this one for sure
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,thats why everyone hate iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,mah battery seriously im buying nokia
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,how many gb are available out of the box apple says it needs gb so im wondering what is the actual number out of the box
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,very expensive phone terrible battery life why apple what the proof that the battery is bad
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,best iphone device
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,im from asia this pro gb model cost around nearly usd in my country
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,nice phone with cheap price but bad battery performanace very expensive not cheap
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hi guys just ordered mine but am thinking of sending it back have been watching some revie more say give it some time for the devs to update the apps for the this was an issue for and too when it came out
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,recently came to know that there is no charger and no basic headset inside box forget about headset they could have atleast include charger inside so much cost to pay and this is all we get handset and cable may be one day the apple will get smart enough to sell each piece of the handset separately as far as there are buyers to buy anything that they sell
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,shrink new ipad air into phone touch id and no notch otherwise will never buy iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,using this mobile from october awesome battery life im charginf only once in hours and im using both wifi data
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,while samsung already start using mah in mm body couple months ago also put more quick and simple if you earn enough to have an iphone you dont have time to bottom mah battery only kids have enough time for that larger battery means an unnecessarily heavier larger phone which busy people wont like or need still apple will come out with large high endurance phone the pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you need to drop it from meters to be able to break this phone pretty tough to me you dont need scren is break easly fro half meter try
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,very poor battery life disappointed
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,please do battry endurance test spoiler alert its worse than iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,its always nice to watch these phones come out from distance iphones and other flagships are too expensive for of people the good thing is that these phones raise the bar each year for the best specs this allows for last years top specs to trickle down into mid rangers and mid range tech to trickle down to entry level phones that is amazing to me take an entry level phone from and it will be better than flagship from years ago for real take the iphone and compare it to moto play and you will see for yourself httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,they will always come with tiny battery because they want you to buy their battery case and alot of licensed rd party usb power bank
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,even though its nm is low the battery is still small not good for heavy gamer and internet user
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,rather go with the pro because it has bigger battery that will last me long the more what the is not better thank what are you smoking
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,well really like the phonebut cant afford it now due to current financial instability in our countrythe phone is very very good for all purpose
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,guys am now tired of this icrap its and still no usbc no hz panel no more ikr they use the same old school hardware since five years ago android hardware are evolving so fast that idk apple is gonna catch up like come on
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,it is totally rubish all companies are making in display fingerprint and apple had removed it more have been using faceid for years and have to say it can replace fingerprint seriously think no android manufacturers except huawei want to bring faceid to their product since the cost is too high there are some comments that faceid cannot be used with mask yeah just like you cannot use fingerprint with gloves
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,while all ppl around the world spend most of the their time in house bcuz of corona stayatho more ps part of their big free time means many of time
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,why such bad reviews no one is forcing you to buy buy yourself huawei for the game while all ppl around the world spend most of the their time in house bcuz of corona stayathome how they wanna fill their time with gaming so they must consider that the phone that they wanna buying it must have good result in gaming todays whether like it or not even if you have not been person that playing games before will get attracted to play games
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,asus rog mah poco nfc mah anything with about mah will probably get more in games the iphone and iphone pro run only hours minute while the iphone pro lasts hours minutes the iphone hours minutes and even the iphone se can play games for almost hours xiaomi mi pro can work hours when playing games in the browser runtime test the situation is much better the iphone and iphone pro showed excellent results slightly behind only the xiaomi mi pro when playing youtube videos the results of the iphone and iphone pro are comparable to those of the iphone and iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,can know which phone can be heavy used for hours because im heavy usage user and more asus rog mah poco nfc mah anything with about mah will probably get you through the day if you dont play any high end game hour everyday
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,bet you are joking with installation of mah battery for gb ram and connectivity but anyway it shows how possibly easy it is to fool customers all the times
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,total rubbish heavy usage hours is joke with iphone pro it drains about an hou more can know which phone can be heavy used for hours because im heavy usage user and im looking for phone like that please reply me honest answer for my question because each and everyone who has brain knows that they need some hours to sleep to eat to do there works because no one is jobless unlike you and thats takes half day and rest can be taken to use phone thats how everyone life goes but dont know how is yours
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am just disappointed by the magsafe charging the socalled fast wireless charging which takes about hours to charge phone with less than mah battery imagine on the pro max should take closer to hours waste of money would rather stick to wired charging
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,small battery and just to be honest the battery aint gonna last long sad
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,full day hours pretty heavy usage total rubbish heavy usage hours is joke with iphone pro it drains about an hour under mix of medium usage and idle conditions gets worse if mainly on even if were generous and say it drains hour thats hours day so will get you from am to pm laughable for phone thats the fastest smartphone in the world without big enough fuel tank to run it properly
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,same features of pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,they all have same battery backup no need to improve with battery need to three time charge ev more yes now in android new mobiles come with charger and iphone fast charger only watts and same times need to charge dont like
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hello question for all the people that already have the iphone pro on hand how is the more moved from iphone to pro battery wise would be identical pro runs slight longer then but that maybe because the is already years use to last till night with left pro have left after am to pm usage time but again it will depend on usage pattern my main consumption of battery is outlook youtube phone whatsapp background and others screen time around hours daily
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,display and the battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,mrwhoistheboss done battery test for iphone and pro iphone pro wins by significant difference what is this joke
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery suckss need to charge two times daily am soo dippressed after buying this bull shitt
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,good battery in your one just not in anyone elses they all have the same batteryplease
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the best phone ever bought the low light photos is incredible nice battery too in my one how is the battery performance have seen youtuber did the battery drain test and the result is the pro lasts longer
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple needs to change the design of their flagship phonesthey have using this design for ye more its been years and month since they released this design
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,telephoto in hmmm pathetic
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,when is the review coming up
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,given the battery capacity of the iphone pro it is not worse than the pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,high specification but why compromising batter power just bought the pro and came from thepro have to say that the pro gives me better battery life than what my pro currently gives me my pro has battery health being at home most of the day on saturdayi only burned though all dayon my pro at work my pro dies by the time get out pro only used up coconut battery reads my battery at mah my pro started off at mah and now is at mah after all degradation new phones always have high capacity than what is rated someone with an old iphone will see better battery life with their new phone do wish they added capacity size like the way the pixel did would have paid extra bought the and wish would have waited
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,please remove the notch and increase the bettery remove the notch means removing faceid do you want technology to go backwards despite apple themselves not talking about faceid nowadays it kinda feels like this is peak selfie camera tech huaweis not able to make them improve because theyre banned anyway
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont understand why someone would want to buy phone with this small of battery you know bigger battery weights more if you are not all day on the phone why would you want to carry bigger battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,for camera iphone high specification but why compromising batter power
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,heard htz display and in display fingerprints coming for iphone so im gonna wait for that rather than wasting money for this because there is no change between series and series if both those features comes to iphone mini my next phone will be that phone love compact phones because my hand is small and need phone which suits for my hand
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hz and an apple logo you can have of these but not with mah battery nope
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so it has lesser battery life and slightly faster processor which cannot be used due to screen limitations and lidar sounds great but battery life should have improved not decreased
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple loves number so much and keeping all the camera forever in mp till iphone what great idea so many number in your iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,should go with iphone pro gb or iphone pro max gb would use mobile for atlea more its not really worth to get pro max model unless you record videos lot might just recommend regular with gb then replace it sooner
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery downgrade compared to iphone pro and in battery upgrade mah does not tell the whole story brother you are one of those that are are willingfully ignorant httpswwwtomsguidecomnewsiphonebatteryliferesultsareinandtheyrenotgreat
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,agoswami oct the strong ram will enhance the efficiency of the phones performance along with the new more gona drain this phone only hour ggwp
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,trolls be trolls buy pro have had iphone se about years very good but seems too small now go with pro would reccomend newer hardware etc im considering myself pro too
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,think they drop the charger intentionally so that people use cheap chargers and destroy their batteries so they will have to buy new phone next year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,technical specs need to be judged by engineers and not by ignorant trolls battery life nee more trolls be trolls
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,anyone who is annoyed by the lack of charger they wouldnt buy with the charger either way was most peeved by apple not including charger even when purchased magsafe applecare iphone pro grey iphone pro silver which makes your conjecture to be not credible
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,worst battery performace everif gona use this phone not gona last hour
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,thank for that comment thats what said as if when buy the charger and eyepiece separa more anyone who is annoyed by the lack of charger they wouldnt buy with the charger either way
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,why battery it too small very disappointed yeah though it would be bigger and hdr is alot of consuming energy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple not include charger with all iphone lines is freaking lame and show its greed to the more thank for that comment thats what said as if when buy the charger and eyepiece separately it will not come in pack this is pure greed period
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,even have been using apple phone since long time backbut at one place totally unsatis more you know that battery is consumable item and it can be replaced it doesnt matter what phone is battery equipped they all end in same place after while to recycle bin
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,question why the battery units are not in specifications answer because apple wants to more technical specs need to be judged by engineers and not by ignorant trolls battery life needs to be tested not judged by mah start doing your thing when official numbers are released in the mean time find yourself something else to do
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,theres review now on verge and the battery last only hours lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you pay for this thing then you are already crazy and the price of the charger is irrele more they are selling it for
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,whats the battery size
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,is there hz display no
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the strong ram will enhance the efficiency of the phones performance along with the new processor
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,absolutely love the camera experience as well as the processor choice in this smartphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,wow the bionic plus
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,hey if any of you have enough money to buy me one yeah mate will do
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,still you cant deny the fact that they slow down old iphones you like that one dont you only iphones that required battery replacement were slowed down to avoid phones crashing for the same reason when the battery is replaced the phone goes back to full speed fact is this was not malfunction and the phones were better off with the fix they were only fined for not clearly stating that fix was in place the worst that ever happened is that users got new phone big deal to most of them that would have gotten new phone anyways and the buyers of the old phones replaced the batteries would love to see companies and individuals getting sued over placing malware on their phones and applications android os and most of the manufacturers would need to shut down altogether
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,lame to not have touch id in this time of masks for medical safety how do you want them to change design that was probably planned before the pandemy started haha
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the size of the screen is ich supposed to be similar to iphone isnt it why the body size is depicted differently is this really another design
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,without touch id wi stick with my iphone until they get some sense lamo what joke
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple has changed their skin to provide more android like functionality so you wont miss more still you cant deny the fact that they slow down old iphones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,still no fingerprint sensor lame to not have touch id in this time of masks for medical safety
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,like that they bringing back jobs design the iphone era there was mockup image circulating couple years back about the se and it looked like this except the bezel but dont get why apple is not taking the screen all the way out to the edges prices are disgusting tho
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,no uwb
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,been using it for month now solid design but damn you apple for not including the power brick hz hzhz
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,how painful is to switch from android to ios am on android for approx last years or so more took me about day to read about all to understand how to do thingsyou will see that is easier vs android fool easy phone to make good setup not all is ok with defaultespecialy some security settings you must have just take an iphone from up so you can have decent battery at least good luck
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post you wouldnt mid to read this would you httpswwwandroidauthoritycomfastchargingexplained
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,everything is ok how apple think without power adapter they will sell the iphone after waiting for long time for iphone this apple decision was really disappointed now again need to think for nd option either samsung or any other
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,you already have charger laying around or your laptop or whatever you need to buy nothing more well have unused wall sockets and headphones jack lightning in the original package in the boxes of my iphones from the last years can sell them if you want im actually happy to lose them use the headphones want actually with bluetooth since ages so dont miss jack either why would buy them if apple spends the money to design an even better phone im ok with that lets see after the first reviews
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,deleted post yes man but they do on an iphone thread its very hard to find an apple user bothering android users their android threads no point on doing so if you know what mean
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,dont really get why every time apple releases their new iphone bunch of android users more totally agree with you every time apple releases new iphone you see bunch of android trolls that start trolling around
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,where are battery mah
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple seems to be getting in the thieving business modules where they are removing basic acce more you already have charger laying around or your laptop or whatever you need to buy nothing forget about the carbon footprint dont even get upset apple really wants you to they do it again and again the notch the headphone jack the cameras the prices they will get away with it all and post record profits yet again make use of the intelligence that you were given for once and desist you either want the phone or not if you dont just buy what you want and forget about this people like you are one of the main reasons apple sells their phones so well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,wonder what kind of battery they will place in their ebola phones no worries this thing will cost you like year well driving car
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am surprised though whereas latest android phone has gb ram
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the phone isnt released yethow do you have come to know that the battery drains fast am surprised though
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery is draining so fast do not buy how come person commented the battery for iphone pro is draining fast and how silly fellow is he
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,iphone is overhyped
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,no video
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,whr is battery sizenot indicated
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,where in the stats of the phone does it hint towards fastdraining battery ive looked through it thrice and havent found anything like that unless youre talking about the charging time for it to get from to of minutes
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,think that the season where we used to see huge improvements over previous models are over more apple products were legends but not anymore the features and quality that apple provides are already provided by other companies in much better ways and also at cheaper prices
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,they should banned apple the greedy patent trolls to not use on their phones apple would rip
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,surprised nothing new unfortunately think that the season where we used to see huge improvements over previous models are over for some years now its been just minimal improvements apple could have easily come up with new design but decided to stick to the old iphone design am not camera fan and since purchased the plus in its only now that want to upgrade its just been camera improvements guys guess that season is over the only reason am upgrading now its because of
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the battery really stuck
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple should first solve his instable ios issues instead of releasing new devices im more thats what they do in order to push you buying new phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,assumed this pro model would have the same camera model as pro max with sensor but only pro max has the newest camera so im going to skip this year and keep my pro for at least another year was ready to hand out dollars to apple but guess they dont want my money any more and no im not going to buy huge phone its too big
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery size best mobile
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery size good
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,in case you not noticed were during pandemic with face mask on everyday no touch id
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,agree this underwhelms so more powerful chip but weaker battery the whole thing relies on the battery and no mhz screen clearly puts it behind competitors yet the price is ahead of the competitors half baked
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,battery size
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,without high refresh rate in good job
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,apple almost reached the technical level of chinese competitors from this should be joke outdated camera no fingerprint sensor fast charging wired really the mainstream is already over the flagship phones are at no high res audio this phone is joke apple released the new iphone with some upgrade
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,disappointed that the pro is somewhat inferior to the pro max camera wise and was hoping for hz display as just spent lotsa money to upgrade my office monitors to hz ips need very fast and expnsive ips panels to avoid ghosting at hz it is so much better to scroll through long documentswebsites was hoping for tb storage as well just in case suddenly want to record long kfps video not too happy but all in all the improvements re significant over my pro ordering on friday
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,oh just hate that big notch ohh you just hate that it cost more than
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the haters gonna hate whts there to hate its same as iphone lmfao
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,no charger or earpods
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so nice and like the colour
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,so there is no power button touch id like the leak said hmmmmm
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,does it come with air pod charger
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,the apple we all know died since no different between pro and pro same ugly notch more the apple you know maybe the apple know died with jobs that company would launch new category of products every years ever since jobs died we got what apple watch contrast it with late aio pc the death of pc towers for many people early ipodsitunes store synergy the death of conventional music industry first true smartphone capacitive apps the death of cellphones the tablet as distinct category instead of mini pc if not for jobs death the death of laptops jobs dies tablets remain an unfinished idea and apple goes on to trully invent nothing new and reovolutionary one that kills the old ways new and better ones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,fo an expired usb port
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am dissatisfied as apple didnt add screen with hz or even hz they chose to go with instead
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,it is lighting to usb type
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,whats the battery capacity obviously or mah
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,not seeing anything new same old things
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,ram
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,its just pos if it does not have at least qualcomm modem
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,does it have qualcomm modem what size of the battery and the ram
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,good performance
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,am getting this phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,in this quarantine time no touch idwhy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,no one talked about the battery and the ram great device love it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,cant wait for its comparison with the note
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro,im glad apple doubled the storage and still priced it at
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,are you serious yes need it so much
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,iphone is the best
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,this iphone doesnt have call record for security purposes are you serious
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,good phone loved ok
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,it is good phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,become lag and slow after ios apple always do that
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,trying to use find my phone is stupid if you ask alexa to alexa found my phone they ask for code they sent to your phone if you one where your phone was you wouldnt need cide why do they not just send bing or ring just in case you are not in the same room as your phone just make it ring until phone is found
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,so what this does not mean iphones are great everyone have their own choices his company ma more this surely doesnt make but proves iphones great the ceo of the one android users frequently mentions as their torch bearer uses iphone if it doesnt prove that iphone is better than xiaomi what does
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,still this is only good if you want good camera smartphone and then you are apple fanboy tha more even screen auto brightness doesnt work properly on most android phones let alone neck to neck
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,which colour would you approve to be the best
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the phone which am using currently is phone pro max which have had for almost mon more my question and reaction is how can the phone be damaged by small splash of water when you are advertising and according to technical characteristics the phone is waterproof ip dustwater resistant up to for mins and have no problem with which apple loses its authority over other brands when talking with many users of other brands of phones have the conclusion that most of them are put in water until now the phone has never been put in water and wet although according to technical specifications it is waterproof
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,got it yesterday so amazing ip pro max are exellent
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,verry nice bought
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,sucks that it doesnt have an optional button or feature for unlocking the phone not only with face masks but people who only wear glasses part of the time readers etc have problem getting the phone to recognize them unless it is the perfect picture you took either with the glasses or without or with the mask or without very annoying as would say of the time have to put in my passcode
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,maybe less sharpening and more efforts on highfrequency detail instead of hdr would help couldnt agree more with this statement the amount of oversharpening effect from the photos is totally unbearable its only great for social media upload thats for sure would upload the fullres photos on flickr or even use them as desktop or laptop wallpaper definitely not
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,definitely not for heavy games like dblminecraftgeshin definitely for medium games like moba games even chipset is bad in handling throttle stability
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,great phone but please improve on battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,good one you got here too also mr bert blevins trading strategies have proven accuracy more lot of people dont want to fall for this crap cause youre trying to scam people that are illegal mean this is the internet there are some bad things that are happening this year which is pretty nonsensical and complicated because is
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,but after looking through lot of greenery this is probably the only tiny difference more want to add that larger sensor larger lens does improve the signal to noise ratio but this doesnt necessarily make difference if the spatial noise reduction isnt reduced
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,this is so lovely err you do realize that this is tech site not dating site
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,these people are so nonsensical dont mind reading those comments they were so jerky more this is so lovely
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yeah they really are guess well have follow the rules before our comments get deleted
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,even lei jun used iphone he even cant make xiaomi looks premium to other executive peop more so what this does not mean iphones are great everyone have their own choices his company makes very good phones he uses it because he likes their software as xiaomi sofware is just like iphone clone copy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,overrated phone unacceptable absence of decent macro picture capability we are in this more even lei jun used iphone he even cant make xiaomi looks premium to other executive people the price is wise but that lose all kind of limited and luxury that flagship need thats why xiaomi ceo even not brave enough to use xiaomi as the executive business phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dose this phone has imitation bought online what am seen is different it looks the same more had this iphone for about two months after it was launched due to health concerns in and dont quite understand why people complains about it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dont care what anyone said about iphone pro max just got one for business purposes more iphone pro max is going to have these problems solved by adding hertz refresh rate decent camera quality great battery life and enhanced performance
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dont need to see the review for it have it and its on par with ultra only in ultra more dont care what anyone said about iphone pro max just got one for business purposes and love it am very comfortable with apple products am in the process of buying another phone for every day use this time it will be samsung am throwing away no am paying for quality stop criticizing companies that providing us with good quality products love you all peace
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,looked again at the sample images of the pro max and am quite shocked how bad the details more there is also pro raw option to make the details look decent
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,camera is superb photos look mediocre to me really bad even midrange androids have better quality looked again at the sample images of the pro max and am quite shocked how bad the details look even in perfect light conditions apple uses lot of aggressive and ugly noise reduction google nexus in its hdr on mode is far superior in such light conditions the nexus usually combines raw files with the same exposure settings in areas with decent signal to noise ratio this leads theoretically to the base iso performance of mm sensor
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,you are damn right bro they couldve included something more than the usb that pin
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,am going to say it again photos look bad with smudged details even iphone took better photos doubt that it will look bad even though they were on par with each other so what more could you expect in this iphone is without doubt the best iphone on the market stop being selfish
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,megapixels dont actually count so just stop complaining also its not medio more am going to say it again photos look bad with smudged details even iphone took better photos
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,did you read the review main camera photo quality is mediocre at best so shut up dont need to see the review for it have it and its on par with ultra only in ultra wide camera and zoom the ultra is on par but other than this iphone pro max gives the best looking shots even in low lightning conditions so you shutup and open your damn eyes as image processing on iphones is the best with the work done by its processor and its software
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,such an amazing phone really liked it when bought this monster camera quality is just su more camera is superb photos look mediocre to me really bad even midrange androids have better quality
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,are high or what pro max produces some best quality photos that cannot be found on any more did you read the review main camera photo quality is mediocre at best so shut up
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,daylight image quality quite bad due to noise reduction definitely worse than google nexus more are high or what pro max produces some best quality photos that cannot be found on any other smartphone as its image processing is the best in the world so just shut up
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,mrs feb this is my th iphone purchase previous to this have had the plus and plus was more no matter what flagship phone you get you still need screen protector and strong care available easily not cheap plastic case this is my th iphone and use it rough pocket bag and after months of heavy usage when sell my old phone and the buyer checks by removing the protector and cover not single scratch ever has been found

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,and an iphone that doesnt require an additional screen protector
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,superb battery life great phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the perfect iphone just doesnt exist yet unfortunately its just like you always have to more and an iphone that doesnt require an additional screen protector
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple should stop playing gimmicks of shortchanging customers by not giving them the charger more agreed if they really cared about the environment they would stop changing the connections so you have to keep buying new cords chargers wireless chargers earphones that can only be used with the apple connector etc
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,very very beautiful and nice quality mobile

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,any of having issue with touch screen while touching any issue on pro max yes
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,iosneveragain nov thank you android you stated have periscope zoom camera that does zoom almost as good as on ppro optical zoom correction almost isnt even accurate it is not as good someone that takes photos will know the importance of zoom both pros and cons because using that feature changes the outcome of the picture drastically especially when printed periscope with zoom is poor quality zooming not just relevant for phones but professional cameras zoom option is not only necessary feature but optical zoom is critical for the quality of any picture zooming in isnt ideal unless its used very little it actually ruins the quality of the image which is the zoom you refer to optical zoom with great quality telescope lens or telescope lens features with optical zooming cell phones offers great quality photos anything else ruins the picture very little manual zoom with that wont make huge difference but is joke id get into the reasons and the importance of pixels and then the importance of pixel quality pending the telescope lens and type of zooming but enough has been said apple iphone pro max is almost comparable to professional level camera basic digital camera provides average quality pictures it usually has with the option of manually zooming in but ever notice the more you zoom in manually the quality of the image gets distorted the pixels and sensors regardless of zoom make the difference add zoom into the equation and the periscope with the option of manual if used compared to quality lens sensors and optical zoom there is absolutely no comparison might look great on your phone might look semi decent printed in photos put that same picture next to professional grade option printed picture it will speak for itself
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,lol here is the typical android fanboy who runs off the specs to make him feel better about hi more lol look at the apple insecure fanboy who would buy overpriced phone just to show to his so called friends that his rich and smart pathetic same as samsung fanboy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nice mobile nice
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple is doing wrong by not supplying charger and headphone with sky higher price people expect more accessories
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dont care about the cons specially the refresh rate people who cant live withou more the perfect iphone just doesnt exist yet unfortunately its just like you always have to make concessions my perfect iphone would be iphone pro max with every spec the iphone pro max has plus some specs of the best samsung oppo oneplusphones or more mah battery or revolutionair new chip and screen that needs times less battery if anyone could do its apple they did with the mchip watt wired chargingand watt wireless charging oneplus can do it they claim so why apple not even with the superior magsafetechnique how can you plan to delete the chargingport from the iphone when wireless charging is still on watt max it will be downgrade at the chargingaspect of the phone downgrade even compared to the iphone and all the other models with charging port you can charge with an pd usbc charger at watt unless they can add it magsafe with at least or wattquick charging refresh ratescreen but the perfect phone seems impossible as said
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nickb nov man my android is march model and it has ultravision engine amoled qhd resolution more lol here is the typical android fanboy who runs off the specs to make him feel better about his phone lol the series isnt even getting android until january lol yah you got android cause oneplus only updates the flagship phones of their current year cycle come back to me next year and lets see if you have android before everyone else lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,iosneveragain nov dont change the topic to these are the words in your previous post that more would be pretty nice on iphone but android phones are absolutely terrible at video recording
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,this phone sometimes volumes up and down automatically and while watching videos screen was on and off itself after restore stopped screen onoff but still volume was up and down just sometimes anyone has this issue
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,haha last comment was so good sticking to the metal sim pin next year it might not come hahahhaajajaha
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,obviously good device but not for middle class family actually it is for rich
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,too wide and heavy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,your android phone is an android its not an iphone its subjective to say its better its more absolutely correct oranges and apples are both fruits but are different fruits iphones and androids are smart phones but are different phones there shouldnt be comparison cause its an unending dispute
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,after read your blog think will buy this product thank you solving all my doubts keep it up congratulation great choice
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,iphone is brand in itself every new release brings even more better features and class to more lol good joke
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,and yet you seem to spend the vast majority of your time on apple related threads defending th more the difference between me and mr ios never again is dont spend all my time trash talking about products by my own admission have absolutely zero interest in ever owning have no issue with actual ios users critiquing the platform have my own points on that nothing is perfect after all maybe should though eh head over to couple of the articles concerning the or so xiaomi devices that have been released since this time last week and just drone on and on about how awful think them do be and how much never plan on using any of them
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,ives is currently predicting that apple suppliers will ship million iphone units in the initial launch period with sales just less than million possible but on the outside edge of the prediction model crazy iphone sales coming
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,new things and features on iphones are hardly useful they are gimmicks magsafe lol wea more magsafe type gimmick will soon find its way on android as will the absence of an included charger and think you know that well have to see what you have to say when it happens im betting youll change your tune quick enough then and what is with you droidheads and this lidar thing youve all been quite quiet about the do nothing tofs that have been thrown into the back of various droids along with useless macro and depth sensors etc this all just so claim of multiple cameras can be made what is all that if not total gimmick like said earlier am willing to bet that ios and its ecosystem find practical uses for lidar way before anything noteworthy or practical actually gets done with these tofs on android and they have been there for couple of years already in some cases
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,was proving the iphones dont get better every year argument false of more new things and features on iphones are hardly useful they are gimmicks magsafe lol weak magnets dont provide any safety proven gimmick designed to make users pay for some cheap magnets lidar to get portraits cheap looking background blur to compensate for small sensor people in dont need lidar or potrait mode anymore the sensor size is big enough to give natural background blur that doesnt look artificial nobody uses ar on smartphones not even on android what else is new new design no they stuck to the old look with that terrible notch what else ohhhh no charger in the box what else in new ohhh the same old fast charging speeds from and the battery life got worse compared to iphone series anything else ohhh the chip which is marginally faster than and got beat by the rog sporting nm chip in speed tests also throttles badly compared to technically every new thing is nothing but gimmick which is why most reviewers not recommending iphone users to upgrade
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,jokes on you similar things can be said about the video with some rather small di more dont change the topic to these are the words in your previous post that with bad picture quality debunked your claim just accept that you are jealous as you dont have on your iphone and android already has great footage mi pro that this site hardly had any complaints with unlike the footage from galaxy ultra your claims of being gimmick or bad have been debunked
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,current new iphones facing display issues with too much yellowish tints out of iphones ratio
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,checked the mi ultra footage the footage isnt even better in fact when turn more jokes on you mi pro is the latest flagship from mi not the mi ultra heres what this site had to say about that footage we are hardpressed to find any issues with the video colors are punchy dynamic range is wide notice the detail in the shadows it plays smoothly contrast is great and theres no noise sharpness and detail are impressive
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,your definition of apples products other peoples definition of apples products more did even mention apple products that was for all smartphones ill label any android with garbage battery life as garbage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,real upgrades yep that fps that youre going to use once that wi more people who dont have fps recording capable phones cant use it at all not even once rest of us use it when necessary its one touch away go and check out the footage out of xiaomi latest flagship and lg
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,well have pro here and can tell you that just aint true its battery comfortably ge more your definition of all day device light usage other peoples definition of all day device moderateheavy usage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,you do realise that iphone goes lot easier on local contrast saturation and shadow boost more as far as have seen iphone photos have exaggerated colours and unnaturally warmer compared to pixel just bad quality photos overall from iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nickb nov lidar is for depth scanning for better photos where are these better photos nobody even goog more if lidar is marketing trick then its only much as the tof sensors that some androids have id be willing to bet that practical applications will be developed for the iphones lidar scanner long before any such uses are figured out for the droid tofs and they have had head start
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,then why are you even here honestly every ios or apple related thread on this site and more thank you
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,only iphone pro max can last all day rest have to be charged in the middle of the day well have pro here and can tell you that just aint true its battery comfortably gets me through the day granted dont do lot of gaming mainly because fell smartphone gaming to be ridiculous concept for anything beyond the likes of crossy road and candycrush etc not going to say its battery champion but it is an all day device
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,and they say how iphones last all day too only iphone pro max can last all day rest have to be charged in the middle of the day
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,gsmarena has already said how androids last all day are you questioning them get off thi more and they say how iphones last all day too
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,they dont understand its too hard for them hz ios device is already smoother more lol owned hz iphone pro max previously with my current op pro its night and day difference never going back to pedestrian hz ever again if you dont believe me almost every unbiased reviewer in including this site during their iphone review has mentioned about iphone being not that smooth compared to android phones with hz display and above have you even experienced hz touch sampling rate or lowest response times on android flagships
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,another bogus argument where did the article say million people switched from android more where did the article say million people switched from android to ios then where all these new iphone users are coming from the space what other choice there is than most of them coming from android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,deleted post another bogus argument where did the article say million people switched from android to ios also give me stats about number of ios users converting to android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,you are jealous that iphone doesnt have hrr so you go to sleep by convincing yourself more what is it will this jealousy thing are you really so simple that you believe an iphone user that craved hrr so much wouldnt simply get an android no the truth is that ios users might desire such feature on future iphone but are quite content to wait its only one feature after all such people who are quite happy with ios would at present need to sacrifice plethora of other features that drew them to the platform in the first place just so they could scroll slightly smoother on an android device am an iphone user right now had hrr been the be all and end all for me would have picked an android that featured it after all if can afford an iphone then the vast majority of androids are also an option for me it just isnt that important so jealous nah will leave that kind of thinking to simple minded drones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,on the other hand you dont have any proof besides your biased experience th more gsmarena has already said how androids last all day are you questioning them get off this site since you clearly cant digest garbage battery life of apple
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nah my stays on hz it is crazy smooth my fe stays on hz all the time tried hz but is pointless at hz the battery life is very good and right youre just the minority who cares about hz do care hz is enough hz is passable if the color balance is great besides iphone screen supports dcip color space
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,where are you getting your bogus data from million people switching links or didn more the number you requested is zero
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,its exactly like that apple is getting average million android switchers yearly more where are you getting your bogus data from million people switching links or didnt happen make sure you also mention amount of people converting from ios to android users
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,and youre not the majority ios will never be as polished or advanced like android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,when talking about pro max compared it with mi ultra not the pro the differences is more color can be easily tweaked by changing ai mode or other tweaks small sensor from toyphone cant compete with big boy sensor from xiaomi
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,buddy no one is moving from ios to android its only the other way around that it happens as you say so sir my phone is dancing around my fellow college iphone pro am better in so many ways and dont talk me performance and speed lk at gbgb oppo find pro my phone benchmarks first they tell the true this phone is flying no matter what you do on it write message play game listen to background youtube on my airpods probest compact bluetooth headphones best smartwatch is apple watch got it too but iphonenowhere near the best phones oh sorry apple dont have background youtube or all together at once but as you almost said it iphone is best phone yes rofl
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,lidar sensor and performance lidar is for depth scanning for better photos where are these better photos nobody even google cant find the better pro max photos compared to pro also compared to pro max they are like the same marketing trick wait future ar needs people change their phones once year what future ar you pay for something lidar you wont need performance they all the same in all apps games ui read pro max pro max over same speed in real life not same on android you get real upgrades every year even every months
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,have you actually looked at the pics from the mi pro no because have the iphone more you do realise that iphone goes lot easier on local contrast saturation and shadow boost compared to iphone series right
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,android is billion users and growing every phone above is android ultra premiu more that really doesnt change anything what said earlier lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hahaha is that so is that why ios is stuck at nah thats not why its because cupertino doesnt have candybars for the broke folk average selling price you know what that is google it with only apple makes the most money in the market isnt that funny know im laughing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nickb nov if you ask pro max owner what is upgraded over pro max silence not so in android wor more lidar sensor and performance
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,am an android user and dont see lag when scrolling at all on insta facebook yout more did said its amazing when said its amazing when when when
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,only its price is top of the bill
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,httpsmgsmarenacompiccmpphpidtypeidphoneidphoneidphone more have you actually looked at the pics from the mi pro no because have the iphone has lower res but much better color balance and much less processing artifacts and skin smoothing the mi has snapchat filter look at maybe you are happy with photos that pop on phone screen but those of us who view photos on large screens dont like the garish colors xiaomi does and to somewhat lesser extent huawei
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,stunner but worth fortune in india apple should really think of toning down the cost of more ask your govt not apple
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,gas burner design with ugly notch on the front is eye catching more like an eye sore does not look like an eyesore but the mini to me either only screen is not that eye catching because its locked to hz
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,if you ask pro max owner what is upgraded over pro max silence not so in android world move now and save your cash
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,how are you putting screen on hours on your phone and why wont be surprised if that guy is getting hr screen on time with rog it is beast phone with gigantic mah battery it can literally serve as powerbank for other phones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,with the integration of the apple bionic chipset there is no doubt the performance of the more gas burner design with ugly notch on the front is eye catching more like an eye sore
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hz good for android phone so can void seeing lag when scrolling am an android user and dont see lag when scrolling at all on insta facebook youtube chrome it only drops frames when my battery is below really like android specially for youtube and chrome and the file management which are better on android than ios and coming to the high refresh ratenow you are saying its gimmick but when apple will give it maybe years later please telle you will not say that its amazing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,am running hz on my rog hr screen on time plz take your lies about android users more how are you putting screen on hours on your phone and why
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,what the heck does that have to do with the refresh rate high refresh rate is an experience with your touch its not the same on non glass device its not the same on non touch device like high refresh monitor as well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple bionic chipset along with the amazing camera setup of the phone are two of the best features while the battery could have been better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,while the rest of the specs and the features are pretty top notch apple should really focus on getting bigger battery spec for the phones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,lately it feels as if your constant reposting of dxomarks plugs is starting to impact more httpsmgsmarenacompiccmpphpidtypeidphoneidphoneidphone base on details artifacts alone both mate pro mi ultra surpass your beloved pro max huawei mate image processing are the best turns to lowlight it looks like mid ranger vs two flagship phone pro max image processing are too much smudgy yet have lot of noise with oversharpening come along
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,lol fold doesnt even have solid glass display afcourse its not going to of more what the heck does that have to do with the refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,used fold for about days didnt feel this way at all also an implementation more lol fold doesnt even have solid glass display afcourse its not going to offer same touch experience as regular glass screens
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,lot of these phone have terrible after sales and other issues havent been using io more go ahead and submit your list of which phones you think deserve in those respective categories
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,youre not answering my question did you compare the raw images side by side or not no did not compare raw images when was talking about garbage quality meant the output from auto mode and garbage in comparison to other big boy sensors
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the refresh rate on ipad dials itself down in various apps to conserve battery its not more used fold for about days didnt feel this way at all also an implementation which doesnt murder your battery life is the best implementation
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,highend flagship smartphone of the year samsung galaxy note ultra snapdragon mid more lot of these phone have terrible after sales and other issues havent been using ios for while but where are all the ios devices am sure some should have made the list
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,its garbage sensor compared to other sensors on the market like imx more youre not answering my question did you compare the raw images side by side or not
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,garbage sensor are you saying that after shooting photos in raw in those two sensors then com more its garbage sensor compared to other sensors on the market like imx imx imx
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,its spec gimmick to make the stupid feel that they have something better than apple or more seems like comment coming from person who never seen hrr screen on mobile phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dont even understand the obsession with hz yes its obviously nice to have no que more the refresh rate on ipad dials itself down in various apps to conserve battery its not the perfect implementation of high refresh rate use any hz and above flagship phone as daily driver for week or more youll never go back to hz ever again
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,garbage sensor garbage processing garbage photos the imx is much better more garbage sensor are you saying that after shooting photos in raw in those two sensors then comparing them side by side or simply making it up
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,true that tested it in the shop it did not impress me they exaggerated with the size it more its nearly identical to the pro max you just have tiny hands
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,thats probably because the iphone pro max is the better phone at least it came with more true that tested it in the shop it did not impress me they exaggerated with the size it is very uncomfortable to hold it while the pro is too small think would have been better choice liked the straight lines the lack of hz is embarassing did not expect that hope next year they will add that and much better camera
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,preordered the day and got the phone last friday from apple while setting up found more noticed the same in germany in shop the display looked bit yellow even though turned off the true tone had the same problem with my iphone last year and returned it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,while majority android users disable their hz and just to save battery nah my stays on hz it is crazy smooth
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,im using on hz and the battery is more than great all day using the phone without problems want to buy an iphone but only if it has hz or more without that dont care how fast it is or anything
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dear iphone department have observation recording in built call recorder its expansiv more phone recording is illegal in many countries so apple choosing not to get into any legal issues thats why not giving inbuilt call recording even android is allowing only incoming call recording through google voice app or thirdparty app similarly apple is giving the option to purchase thirdparty app from the app store
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,actual proven tech let me guess according to you its the verge right thi more nah not just the verge any site including gsma has better ideas of which phones are great compared to the blue anonymous guy and now you
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,android is also safer if choose not to sideload apps true man sideloading apps is the way to go update them every days google play services remains frozen behind firewall not allowed to connect to the internet removed google play services dependencies for certain apps using lucky patcher privacy is in our hands on androidthings like these are not possible on ios in ios the system apps and others end up automatically connect to the internet with no provision of putting them behind firewall and the stock firewall is terrible
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,wow its almost and apple is still stuck with hz panels thats just an more while majority android users disable their hz and just to save battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,no one has mentioned the zoom capability for regular photos is it only measly times my more lol please that and zoom is still purely digital the zoom in this phone is pure zoom since it has its own sensor
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,did not updated my iphone only coz of face id its so annoying to enter password or sl more so doubt if apple will go back to the fingerprint scanner that is why im still eyeing the iphone plus to this day facial recognition is still big joke especially for android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,think it is decent phones but for the prices when look at the specs im good sticking with my samsung note the same reasons didnt go for samsung note ultra lately we can get more decent pretty good phones for way lesser price but of course packing with the latest iphone will definitely sign of prestige
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,saw the actual photo samples on the internet and also the comparison chart on gsmarena to se more garbage sensor garbage processing garbage photos the imx is much better than the imx
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,no device is safe but ios is little more safer android is also safer if choose not to sideload apps
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,biggest bs ive ever heard if theres bug with brand new graphics card do you return it more hes talking about lens flare at night and focus issue which is hardware thing not software ultra had this issue software cant save you and apple is notorious for not bringing any camera features to older iphones heck the iphone xs series did not get any night mode support
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,exactly but the youtube reviewers are not gonna point these out simply because they dont know this stuff
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,you keep on listing the same laundry list of phones problem is we care more for an actual more actual proven tech let me guess according to you its the verge right this site is far more comprehensive in their review and pro max camera are letdown according to this review given the sensor size its used even the ibis are just marketing gimmick no difference sometimes worse than other good camera stability the good part can see are their proraw dolby vision support
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,techradar nov try the huawei mate pro like hell its even possible to get one in the first place lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,seems to me like the iphone pro and promax take better pics at night than during the day wa more try the huawei mate pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,had mine for days and ended up returning the phone main reason is the camera it had bu more ha ha lets say that you are not one of those losers who is just here to advertise about pixel and that the problem you mentioned is real in that case dont think its widespread issue otherwise more people would have mentioned the same in any case going to pixel is ridiculous in its own right as that pixels are the worst device in terms of quality control am not an iphone user by the way and my previous two devices are pixel xl and pixel xl but am never touching that unfinished piece of garbage that the pixels are
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,good detailed review but expected section of longer exposure photos like or sec ones more thats right
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,which os are you using you think your device is safe with ios lol no device is safe but ios is little more safer
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,for one am excited this year is my once every years update to my phones so my outgoing note and iphone plus are being replaced by the iphone pro max and note ultra
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,just one flaw in your post all of those phones are running android thanks but dont us more which os are you using you think your device is safe with ios lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,maybe its just me but ive found that the problem with integrating the ear piece and the loud speaker is that one too many times ive put the earpiece to my ear for call only to find out that ive unwittingly enabled the calls speaker option when answering then my ear drum gets blown out by the first sound of the caller next to my ear ouch it stunningly hurts and with how loud these phones are it feels like its really doing some real damage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,bro thats just lazy entering passcode is so
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,looks like watercolor party mushed details everywhere
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the stabilization doesnt seem to be better without night mode the pro max chooses the same exposure time with night mode it chooses shorter exposure time than the pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,here in asia you can buy pcs poco pro on the price of pcs iphone max poco pro snapdragon fullscreen super amoled mah battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the one in the iphone is sony imx this was disclosed by apple but not officially ass more at least on iphone pro the main cam is apple isight mp camera
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,where is mate pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,and cents for gb lol thats another phone with sd
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,iosneveragain nov gsmarena can you tell us which model the main sensor is imx even in teardown people more main imx uwa imx telephoto imx
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,lede buried the headline should read no reason to upgrade unless you really really want
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yawn guys why dont you review the apple devices
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,does the pro max have native bit display
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,as an android boy feel this iphone isnt too bad was afraid for that battery but more highend flagship smartphone of the year oppo find prooneplus pro midtier flagship smartphone of the year samsung galaxy fe glg vmi pro budget flagship smartphone of the year poco pro compact smartphone of the year sony xperia ii midrange smartphone of the year redmi prorealme pro budget smartphone of the year poco foldable smartphone of the year samsung galaxy fold gaming smartphone of the year asus rog best design lg wing best battery asus rog best screen oppo find prosamsung galaxy note ultra best software experienceui oxygen os android best camera mi ultrahuawei mate pro plus smartphone manufacturer of the year xiaomi
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nope imx are quad bayer mp sensor at size all iphone excep more all the iphone series except the pro max using last years sensors imx iphone pro max using imx according to kimovil this sensor is far weaker in quality than the sony imx on galaxy series and the xperia ii its probably similar in quality to gw sensors from samsung
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,this is true the best of the best plus one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple has always been super secretive about the sensor module so no one except apple themselv more the one in the iphone is sony imx this was disclosed by apple but not officially assume it is also imx in the iphone series except the pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,its sub par piece of crap but will still sell like hot cakes sad yet disturbing truths
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,surprising that apple still uses watercolor noise reduction looks so ugly
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,check the exmor page on wiki to see if it is there already doubt it is any variant of the more there is nothing on the exymor page regarding what iphone pro max is using imx didnt see that either
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,do not knowmif anyone else has noticed this brands do not seem to have same efforts to ultra wide for example the uwa of has similar hardware used by cam of but even if you use with option it still performs better than the uwa of
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,wow review score is worse than iphone pro max thats probably because the iphone pro max is the better phone at least it came with charger and headphones in the box the design also made it more comfortable to hold the pro max doesnt do anything better than last years phone and battery life is worse this year as well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,night mode for portraits works only on the main camera meanwhile other phones have dedicated potrait lens that give excellent portraits day or night without needing night mode
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the fact that you need night mode turned on by default tells you how meh the camera sensor is by default compared to other flagships this year other flagships like huawei pro and mi ultra dont even need night mode
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,if your display isnt dolby visioncapable but youve transferred original dolby vision files those will still play they appear with low dynamic range and duller colors compared to nonhdr or converted most compatible files but theyll play translation dolby vision is gimmick and better to turn it off
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,gsmarena can you tell us which model the main sensor is imx even in teardown people havent mentioned it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,so what the fuss that apple make about new main sensor in pro max see no different from the rest of ip series dont get me wrong they are still one of the best on the market right now but you literally can get the same experience with previous gen ip
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the camera qualitysame as what dxo describe they were right after all
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,pretty much perfect phone battery life is surprisingly very good imo the rest speaks for itself own mate and pixel but can appreciate good phone when see one silver would be my choice and of course no case too nice to hide it in case honestly haha
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,my phone lasted pm to at pm wonder if have faulty battery have off and bluetooth
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the lens is still mm of course its not the same lens larger sensor no matter how large wont capture more light per time from an object if you use the same lens the iphone has focal length of mm whereas the iphone pro max has focal length of mm with the same number thats the reason why it captures more light per time from an object the sensor size has nothing to do with it its very common misunderstanding
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,how measured deltae deviation when evidences that it shifts up to with lower brughtnessthis year panels are worst then models
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,worst photos among all phones above way low sharpness on the edges compared to center many shots shows turf and leaves all smeared few shots have ghosting ultra wide has same awful performance seen on those midranges that use mp it is weaker performance than pro max camera
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,if it had qhd or screen score would be less than
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,its much better value for money than the inferior pro its big and lacks hz screen but its still very good phone the camera hardware is not up to my expectations however if you want compact iphone just buy or
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,absolutely awful camera quality from apple

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,pro max and pro max which is durable both are actually but if you are going for new features and update go for pro max but if you just want phone that will serve you for work or anything your not bother about the feature or update just get pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,skip to pro max instead if your going to buy it in why bit longer ios support if more pro max can still use the latest update not only pro max

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,which iphone to choose phones are same price nd hand look like newi want gb but know more double storage screen size and mildly better battery so if you are moderate user of mobile phone then it is better to have bigger screen and bigger storage so pro max is better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,why shouldnt will there be any problem if update my pro max to
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,you should take pro max mainly because of the hz display and the notch will be smaller more and have green screen
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,smooth but should upgrade to ios
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,go for ip pmax bro much better refresh rate screen etc not better cause has many screen issue with hz

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,inaccurate comment youve mentioned your brother using pm and later pmobviousl more dont you know what tradein mean how would they use that same phone and compare it to newer models
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,im stil rocking pro max il do gaming genshin honkai pubg moba still worth and daily use super great im stay ios great smooth and no issues however this is the best upgrade ip plus to promax
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,maybe dont flagship samsung in gaming samsung is much better cuz playing pubg more inaccurate comment youve mentioned your brother using pm and later pmobviouslyyoure trying to discredit the product and your story is unbelievable
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,get pro max with bonus green screen lol
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,im really hesitating between iphone pro max and galaxy plus what di you recommen more the pro max will be better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yeah true however the pro max is gonna last longer if you want reliable phone get the ip more would say both are good for last longer time
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,galaxy su exynos overall for the bigger screen and larger battery otherwise the for more yeah true however the pro max is gonna last longer if you want reliable phone get the iphone if you want better phone for the time being get the samsung
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,never had an issue with an update on my note or my note well was talking about note ultra and thats the only scamsung phone brought have no idea how note or worked but note was total disaster for me heat lag unresponsive even temple run lag used it for months and resale it in of total value compare to purchase value got iphoen pm them and just upgraded to pm this feb both are doing great awesome performance and timely updates
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes you can go for pm anytime am using this since launch and it delivered the best rec more never had an issue with an update on my note or my note
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,because both are flagships from the same year both have or years of regular security upd more maybe dont flagship samsung in gaming samsung is much better cuz playing pubg on my brother promax and the screen dim lower but the doesnt battery is better his iphone tho but my ultra last longer than his pm on gaming
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,why would bring samsung here ultra is more fluid than any smartphone right now because both are flagships from the same year both have or years of regular security updates purchased both however the experience is very different like mentioned in comments yes su is an ultimate phone but lets see about the updates after months and samsung definately not for gaming my tab perform far better then its mobile
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,is it worth buying in for gaming and camera better buy ipad air if wanna playing game like genshin
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,of course the galaxy ultra is better than the pro max because its the latest flag more it doesnt check the tests
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,httpsyoutubewbhfhv that what you think apple soc still kills snapdragon you cant compare scores from different os systems since both use different apis to measure the cpu performance also real test is often more accurate here
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nice joke the galaxy ultra is better choice than the pro max its like saying that more of course the galaxy ultra is better than the pro max because its the latest flagship by samsung now if you compare the ultra to the pro max the iphone pro max edges the ultra in almost all specs from camera to battery and overall performance
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hello there am considering to buy iphone pro max is it worthy recommending right now in more just received hand me down iphone pro max and am loving it it does everything need it to do and more it definitely is still monster phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,isnt against the ultra httpsyoutubewbhfhv that what you think apple soc still kills snapdragon
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,pixel pro or pro max pixel pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,but its better than ultra tell me thats joke
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,it is mine in jesus nameamen
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,purchase second hand iphone pro max gb upon checking in other website like iunlocker more most likely the back glass got destroyed or the body so they replaced it with the different body whilest the original color stays on the motherboard cannot be changed in the system settings as far as am aware
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,anyway iphone still the best choice isnt against the ultra
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,sure in everyday use will understand why apple is the choice for the most people common ha more samsung us just optimized in every detail as well
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,note ultra because it has better camera than iphone pro and has zoom for gaming ap more gaming is similar on both
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yeah an year old iphone pro max to beat in performance the ultra or the xiaomi more sure in everyday use will understand why apple is the choice for the most people common hate to say that but iphone is just optimised in every detail love android especially oneplus
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,how much updates will get iphone pro max have it but want to know it is worth to pay more well it came out in and should be around till so if you plan on keeping it further or so years then yeah it is worth it not worth it if you plan on replacing it in year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dont think you read my comment welli meant that theres no way an iphone pro more anyway iphone still the best choice
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,beat it on what beeing broken dont think you read my comment welli meant that theres no way an iphone pro max will beat in performance or benchmarks the ultra or xiaomi ultra
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hey guys pls iphone pronot max or note ultra both priced around the same in my coun more note ultra because it has better camera than iphone pro and has zoom for gaming apple wins but it doesnt matter note ultra can run alot of games on high settings plus its cheaper the note has an built in pen and has laser focus and its like ultra front look wise
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,what you think about pro max how much updates will get for me this phone is monster and more yeah an year old iphone pro max to beat in performance the ultra or the xiaomi ultra dont see that happening
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,samsung actually dont have battery health so we will never known what the battery is at install accubattery app and youll know
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,pro max most secured phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,ive been using my iphone pro max for and half year now its now at battery health have no problems with it money was worth so far its still usable im planning to upgrade to iphone pro max when it comes out next release
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,my iphone pro max battery heart still
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,year month hong kong dual sim varient of iphone pro max with battery health of but still works like charmnever face any issue with dust water or any issies dont know why people complain so much about their fone maybe the fone wasnt handled like it should be handled dont think this will need any upgrades in next years
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,also have the iphone pro max had years now and its been dropped in hot tub number of puddles and been rained on multiple times and it still works considering work outdoors im surprised at how well its held up and that theres virtually no scratches on the screen had put cheap case on it from the get go and even that has survived if your iphone has water damage from light use then its either manufactures error or theres more to your phone abuse story then youre sharing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the phone pro max is complete rip off the phone disconnects constantly and after abou more have iphone pro max for years and my wife have pro and we dont have any problems maybe you were abusing your phone too much
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,definitely not ok first of all even apple recommends that you change your battery below more then why not just replace battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,shalom sep im an android user and about to switch to ios please anyone help should buy this one more go for pro max if have the money
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,my mom has gb pro max in pacific blue shes at ios and this phone is barely years old but is at bh my samsung is more reliable than this
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,still using pro max one and half years and still work very well im thinking to upgrade to pm but its feel buy new phone with same design so stick with this phone until series think
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple is just the best thing that has ever to humanity you rock guys
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,im an android user and about to switch to ios please anyone help should buy this one or iphone instead thanks
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,plus guys is it safe buying pro max with battery health am afraid very soon could more definitely not ok first of all even apple recommends that you change your battery below second of all the iphone pro and pro max are maximum years old phones in general if user takes care of the battery and doesnt push the iphone the phone should loose around per year having less battery on years old iphone that means the person who had it before didnt took care of the iphone or the iphone was used extensively all the time maybe charged times per day constantly third of all buying an iphone with battery health means you are getting far worse battery life than if it had trust me verify this with some iphone models and the difference between battery health and battery health is very big saw years old iphone pro maxs with battery health so is too low in conclusion do not buy this iphone pro max this will not be day usage phone not even with medium usage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,esim support in
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,prefer iphone pro max over iphone pro max dont see any upgrade for example the tele more what is the colour of your phone

Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,friend of mine has one before but he replaced it with samsung ultra which he is regreting now pls is he regretting cuz im planning to buy the ultra
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,my ip pro max suddenly decreased the battery healtu from yo in just week im not more nothing wrong with your phone and the battery percentage isnt accurate tool but it keeps improving as you use and update your phone besides several other aspects that could affect battery health such as overheating over night charging and completely depleting or fully charging your phone this habit can consume you more cycles of your phone battery so calm down your battery is acting normal and just as expected
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,been using iphone pro max since the day of launch till now present my battery is capacity is down to however am planning to keep using till it drop to change battery and it still might hold strong within more year later might upgrade to pro max hopefully they will change it to typec pray am heavy user playing games epic seven artery gear and seven mortal sin from hours streaming twitchtv youtube etc the battery is fairly good love media consumption on this baby because the display of this phone is phenomenal heck it dont have hz but its still very snappy going in and out apps and scrolling pages overall this phone is still great choice for everyday drive
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,does this support zoom meeting change background even without green screen
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,have iphone pro max gold and been used for months and battery health stays percent just make sure charge it at not below percent and only charge at night before sleep im happy with it except for the purple color of front cam but apple fixed it for free
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,never had that happen to the older models plus lost of its battery health but thats over span of years plus only lost in years xs lost only
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple please update your batteries my mom has this pacific blue gb asia model and its now at battery health after only year same thing happened to my and my dads pro these seem to deplete quite quickly all of us are running ios
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,which colour would you choose pacific blue or graphite graphite
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,whats the color of your iphone pacific blue
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,really wish apple to remove battery health info in some of future updates got sick off al more not true im actually upgrading because my battery on the pm doesnt last like it used to see few people here who dont have the battery healt issue on their pro max but they do not say which color they have think the battery defects is with the colors too
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the iphone pro max is so sweetfast and great have been enjoying mine since the day got iti dont think it has problem
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hi am planning to get something either this phone or regular which one would you rec more hello im currently useing pro max and have lot of friends with regular and its just not worth it think pro max its the best option because of the display and max options or go with pro max depends on your budget
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,does any body has experience using esim in this phone any issues or improvement with signal strength
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,everyone asking if their low battery health is normal yes it is the longevity of the battery on this phone sucks and you should see if you can trade it in for the pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,havent had any issues with mine not once battery is pretty good and the camera is stellar
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,horrible phone motherboard problemsignal ic is deadits trash
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hello guys bought iphone pro max on th december almost th month completed but more got it december and have left heavy user and charge with original charger and samsung plug try to keep it between and stopped updating the phone software after iphone came out since then no more battery health drop could be just scam from apple to make people buy new phone would just ignore the info or just change the battery instead of buying new phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,amazing phone switched to the reg iphone went back because there were so many advantages the battery and size difference is huge for me not to mention the camera is amazing great phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,im currently using my pm almost month and my battery health just drop two days ago more have hear about this iphone pro max will like to buy it how much
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,just used for year and battery life
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,honestly just go for the pro max you get hz and much better battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple should increase their phones ba life and make it to stop overheating when in use
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,best iphone not upgrading to iphone pro max it can easily hold for years good luck when it starts doing the black screen of death thing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,me too iphone pro max is very fantastic phone in the world but the problem is the battery strength is very low
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,got this phone on sale today and its working wonders love iphone pro max me too
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,strongly agree tell me about it these brats drive me nuts and feel like they should at least calm down and do some research before purchasing
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,how is it lie when persons sharing their experiences ah yes it is the more strongly agree
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,how is it lie when persons are sharing their experiences how is it lie when persons sharing their experiences ah yes it is they always lie and spread way too bs just to ruin the purchase they also whine too much and would call these troll feedersfanboys kids who are underage to comment on this fourm why not just have comment section without these brats commenting something inappropriate
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,overall this phone is beast
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,keep spreading lies bet some people never had any complaints or issues with this device bu more how is it lie when persons are sharing their experiences
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,good phone doing clear photo has beautiful design especially flat screen makes its handy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,anyone here had they phone stuck at the hello screen if yes how was this fixed more my new phone is rather too complicated its stuck on zoom and wont pen although it says swap up to unlock
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,good day house between this two phone which one can you advised someone to go for more pro max if thats worth the storage space
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,firstly im not good at english hope you understand what im trying to write about also im more precisely but its way too soon to say that the problem is resolved with the pro max or not there are several reasons to point out of why the pro max is by far the best phone from apple
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,did the latest software update which was for calls etc on this and it is still dropping calls and going dead
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,pro max is junk dealing with bluetooth connections and now hardware issues only had more luckily they fixed some of those issues with the pro max so its really not that bad at all
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,careful to those who are bashing apple and their products youve been warned someone is more mean apple is great company their products are good especially the iphone but why the hell would anyone else to bash apple or talk trash about it bet the pro max would be fixing the issues but no one cares that much all they want is seamless and flawless experience at this price point
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,anybody on this thread actually seen the inside of these phones iphones are cheaply made proprietary to the point they are difficult to repair and are designed for the technologically illiterate so if you want phone thats easy for you get an iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,planning to buy love the phone yea but coming from the pro max upgrade later to the pro max after the demand is over let alone crapvid
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,after iphones cant believe that may be switching to android samsung or pixel more hi you complain about battery life and the solution you propose will make it worse did you know than transistor size affects battery life because information needs to travel less and less energy is dissipated in heat the nm process you wrote about would take twice the electrical energy to operate making the battery life half of what nm process smartphone could achieve the solution for your problem is not to grow the transistors in size its to have less transistors then we could talk about sustainability and real life transistor usage using half of the transistors
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,then buy pro max best phone ever
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,why dont like about this phone price is too expensive does not include charger more then buy pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,at tick talk they said won at iphone so didnt get any
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,is never again oct keep dreaming pal was tired of waiting for swiftkey and poweramp to be available on ios more these guys think android is still in gingerbread because they are still stuck in xd
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,android is rubbish it doesnt have good apps google play and every droid market place is fil more keep dreaming pal was tired of waiting for swiftkey and poweramp to be available on ios android apps are lot more polished and they just work
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes am here to prove point but you proved another point because the average iphone user more most of the executives in most android manufacturers as well as at google use iphone heck most silicon valley leaders do so thank you for proving nothing other than the fact that you are bitter about your jittery android
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes yes every android user who comes to the iphone topics claims they can afford one but don more yes am here to prove point but you proved another point because the average iphone user has more money than brains
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,oh belive me we dont need it lol and yes have the means to buy one or maybe two even more yes yes every android user who comes to the iphone topics claims they can afford one but dont want it yet here you are
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,desperate is you coming all the way to iphone thread to come convince yourself you dont wan more oh belive me we dont need it lol and yes have the means to buy one or maybe two even if necessary but need something that gives me my moneys worth
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nope it requires less ram since the os is lightweight lacks true multitasking and doesn more android is rubbish it doesnt have good apps google play and every droid market place is filled with junk even google apps are better on ios than they are on droid
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,lot fanboying here in this overpriced phone see well thats expect since apple more the iphone pro max is beast and thats final it worth the money if you have it splash it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,price too much not practical
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,bigger screen more better for business people big battery ram gb internal tb battery more we want phone not fcking tablet
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,sure but why do you need inch screen it probably wont likely to be featured on more bigger screen more better for business people big battery ram gb internal tb battery mah screen inch ratio slime
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,desperate for what same half decade old design language brain what your community need the most desperate is you coming all the way to iphone thread to come convince yourself you dont want it and lie to us go ahead its hilarious
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,you android guys are getting really desperate now nice try though desperate for what same half decade old design language brain what your community need the most
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,would love to see apple having mandatory security updates and other optional updates instead of impregnating their devices with updates that many will not need like update to access their tesla and home pods miss the days where we had phones for productivity and others dealing with sales or field job while using an iphone is tough game if you have to charge it every or hours will prefer getting simple productivity phone and if want gaming can have dedicated machine for that
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,according to reports the iphone and pro are said to be launched in september but mi more dont think they will double the base storage on the pro models again but it would be nice if the nonpro models also got gb base
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,thanks man youre welcome but to be fair dont necessarily think that apple will ever raise the price for the iphone lineups which would likely to stay the same if some of those rumors were true considering that samsung has reduced the price of the this year which im hoping for the iphone to get decent deals
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,can it come today and like your phones
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,good joke if hz last hours with heavy usage like playing games will be great hours max if battery size stays the same and doesnt overheat
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,are there any rumors so far on the iphone according to reports the iphone and pro are said to be launched in september but might be go on sale for september or th if these rumors are true then the pro models are likely expected to have hz ltpo tb storage option at least eliminate the need for base gb and start with the base gb for the same price wifi and etc however the problem is that the pro max and mini are not gonna be launched in september but might be released on either october or maybe next year time will tell
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,nope it should last at least or days with hz good joke if hz last hours with heavy usage like playing games will be great
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,with hz on days possible with moderate usage but with hz maximum day or less depend more nope it should last at least or days with hz
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,no hours at most to hours of sot would be nice if the iphone pro max lasts as much as possible for the larger batteries
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,they will have hz display but there is no chance in hell it will last days days at max with hz on days possible with moderate usage but with hz maximum day or less depends on the usage days impossible
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,expect the iphone pro and max to last days with single charge and have hz displays they will have hz display but there is no chance in hell it will last days days at max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,ppl didnt put the sensor size of main lens
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,why my moms new ip pro max keep restarting everytime we installed the sim cardcan anyone tell me how to fix it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,ive got my iphone pro max since feb and saw that my battery health is at now
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hye used this iphone after complete survey thanks am now facing an issue its more mine doesnt which is good sign however it will be fixed with the next round of iphones this year as we are getting closer to the end of this year which is very trash compared to
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,too believe this iphone pro max will be the next battery king year yeah but having hz display on the pro and pro max is something that everyone would want which is good move for some however it turned out that the rumor is true hz displays is likely to be featured on the pro and pro max
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,not exactly sure why this is happening to everyone but expect the battery on this iphone more too believe this iphone pro max will be the next battery king year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,guys anyone having problems with their battery health ive got my iphone pro max sinc more not exactly sure why this is happening to everyone but expect the battery on this iphone to last days with or without single charge
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,use one use them all nothing new or exciting on new iphone nowadays nowonder why xiomi is no more what your referring to is the operating system but all android os is the same to but you dont have to spend time in ios you just choose wot you want to do browse web play games photos etc besides most ppl dont look to phone for entertainment its purely tool with the bonus of other features
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,everyone is waiting for the iphone series launch event next month hz ltpo display with more yes all the things you said are correct the iphone pro and pro max will be welcoming upgrade for the modem ultra wide cameras portrait mode video bigger batteries plus smaller notch wifi and hz ltpo promotion displays hope this convinces people buy the right iphone that already has promotion display
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,just because iphones are boring doesnt mean its bad but guess what the iphone more everyone is waiting for the iphone series launch event next month hz ltpo display with aod smaller notch bigger battery hope this features more than enough for million devices to be sold globally
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,youre right we all have different opinions and feelings about the iphone but to me more definitely
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,its ok buddy we all have different opinions but it depends on what we like as now iphon more youre right we all have different opinions and feelings about the iphone but to me its really not that hard to buy the iphone or it just depends on what choices are right for you
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yeah but im hugely disappointed that huawei is cancelled the and mate range due more they finally released the
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,oops sorry dude but im just bit exaggerated am very sorry for making my mistakes more its ok buddy we all have different opinions but it depends on what we like as now iphones are not coming with any innovation they are just perfecting things and thinking of getting more money so we choose what we like
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,first dont give rubbish claims second what said wrong pro max is also great more oops sorry dude but im just bit exaggerated am very sorry for making my mistakes but hopefully you can forgive me
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,absolutely hate iphones and ive used all of the older versions up until iphone they we more dropped your phone more than times that is about once day careless you
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes if you are into old school design better cameras and faster speed then you should otherwi more ill take the iphone pro max because of sleek design which suspect that this is welcoming upgrade
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,does it worth to buy this over pro max yes if you are into old school design better cameras and faster speed then you should otherwise leave it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,true but suspect that the lightning port will remain the same on all iphone models at more yes dont think apple will bring type connection hope next year portless connection wireless
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,smaller notch aod technology wired charging reverse wireless charging upgraded ultr more true but suspect that the lightning port will remain the same on all iphone models at least this year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,agreed the pro max is by far one of everyones favorites but with the iphone in more smaller notch aod technology wired charging reverse wireless charging upgraded ultra wide camera waiting for next month launch
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,as long as it has larger batteries than the predecessor would recommend the iphone pro ma more iphone pro max will come with mah battery capacity with ltpo display increases battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,bought ip promax za version dual sim almost months its really fantastic more agreed the pro max is by far one of everyones favorites but with the iphone in the horizon guess you should wait for this model to land in month or two if you really want hz ltpo displays
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,deleted post what are you talking about the iphone pro max could provide some brilliant pictures other than the fact that it was probably because of optimization
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,deleted post is that the fault of the device
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,at this point yall should probably hold out for the pm this is an excellent phone and havent had any problems or sticking points yet months in but the new stuff comes out soon and the pro feature set will probably be worth it for those that were holding out on pro motion type displays on pro models
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,which believe it or not the iphone pro max is by far one of everyones favorites especially when it comes to reliability and safety also believe that the iphone pro max should be decent upgrade which im saying that it is likely to have hz larger sizes in battery life smaller notch wifi and etc
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,its absolutely amazing if can afford then go for it which
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,still iphone is super duper best but ultra features are good apple iphone pro max is best phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,harjassingh aug why dont you like the iphone still iphone is super duper best but ultra features are good
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,have pro max gb can switch to ultra why dont you like the iphone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,why is it not good is going well but some people say that ultra is better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,some of them would but would not anytime soon am happy with my ultra as iphone will be beh more even though but as soon as we get closer to the end of this year may also be normal year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes it is but their claims could also lead misinformation to you as person who already more some of them would but would not anytime soon am happy with my ultra as iphone will be behind in the league of zoom and camera features for sometime till apple finds way to adopt better zooming sensor and obviously their front deisgn containing the notch
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,kinda cool phone tho bit overpriced
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,this phone is amazing it has larger screen good for watching movies ang playing video games
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yup still like iphones dont get me wrong its still one of the best smartphone more yes it is but their claims could also lead misinformation to you as person who already had the means to make switch from the pro max to pro max covid is more like crapvid
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,ill never knock the ultra the pro max is my own choice but the ultra is beast more yeah but like the ultra more apple have that brand valve thing but ultra does the job better with the best display and best class cameras
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,ok well considering that phone could well have been well over year old at that point more yup still like iphones dont get me wrong its still one of the best smartphone out there but with ultra you are getting more for what you are paying for so am happy with it and as note is not coming this year so su will remain samsungs powerful device until su will come
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,no brought it in used with battery health in march and with full box and accessories and more ok well considering that phone could well have been well over year old at that point battery health indication would seem to suggest it was doing rather well but in any event you appear been able to sell it for decent price and you are hopefully happy with your ultra so alls well that ends well guess
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,then assuming you bought it brand new and not used it would obviously have had fault and more no brought it in used with battery health in march and with full box and accessories and in june it went down to with up with recalibration but just in weeks it went down more and sold it out for and bring ultra at home for brand new deal
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,did nothing had pro max charged it with its original box charger and charge it from more then assuming you bought it brand new and not used it would obviously have had fault and should have been returned
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes youd better hope so cause if they do and it works properly youll find the ex more did nothing had pro max charged it with its original box charger and charge it from to every days but it fell down drastically dont know why and my usage was normal
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes their software is the best but have certain restrictions which you be under and my main pu more yes youd better hope so cause if they do and it works properly youll find the exact same thing assuming lose it every weeks means you saw drop in the battery health percentage every weeks then got to ask what the hll were you doing to it have the pro max had it since th january its its only recently dropped to health and use mine al lot
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,tell me about it iphones arent even that bad especially when it comes to software the more yes their software is the best but have certain restrictions which you be under and my main purpose of switching to android was the battery health which was just terrible losing it every weeks was an disaster but after coming on android it is whole new story hope google dont implement this battery health indicators in their software
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple gives years of ios software updates while google gives years of android software upd more any brand use ios than apple android had plenty brand using it and like realme or vivo or xiaomi that introduce new product every few month too much product means more work for their software delevoper and if they focused product like apple phones every years they cam focused software on the product beside there are many custom android out of the brand that keep update the android version ex redmi note custom os already got stable
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,you mean monthly security updates or major os updates as for my knowledge only apple give more apple gives years of ios software updates while google gives years of android software update same as samsung and oneplus
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,the pixel phones will receive software updates for total of years the oneplus pho more you mean monthly security updates or major os updates as for my knowledge only apple gives more than years major os updates to their iphones other brands years maximum
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,most people keep their phones for long time most people dont some want to change with more its so obvious that people are saying anything bad about this phone which suspect that these people didnt own one have it and its one of my favorite especially when it comes to reliability of this phone
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,well my iphone still working fine till now most people keep their phones for long time most people dont some want to change with the existing technologies so everyone have their own thinking of keeping their phones and in them iphone are the ones which stays long for ever as its the brand of life which stands on the logo of it
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,no buddy then how come starting to go downhill than rather go to different places other than social distancing which it feels kind of dumb and boring anyways
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,guys bought iphone pro max pacific blue gb on th december iphone pro max more within very short time battery drains like capacity am using pro max dual sim still showing battery capacity its alarming
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yes iphones are very reliable they are good more than one year or years use pro max an more well my iphone still working fine till now
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,but to be honest mostly think that the iphone would be slight upgrade from the more sure it will be
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,my biggest gripe was that they should really add hz display to the iphone range but in todays leaks it looks like that the iphone standard and the mini will be sticking to hz display the pro models could likely get hz display but im not exactly sure if this could be deal breaker or not but well see in the end of september after the release
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,so what do you want now buddy but to be honest mostly think that the iphone would be slight upgrade from the however there is lot more to learn
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,then why should wait until the end of the year it feels nonsense cuz there was lot of peo more so what do you want now buddy
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,still in display fingerprint notchless design and periscope zoom does not exist on it so peop more then why should wait until the end of the year it feels nonsense cuz there was lot of people who havent been vaccinated which they made the year trash than feel like im being frustrated and pissed off by how garbage the year was than like omg was by far the least year after ended
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,grams is too heavy for phone dont say anything bad about this phone it looks fine to be honest
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,im not entirely sure if anyone else who has the means to make switch but in my opinio more still in display fingerprint notchless design and periscope zoom does not exist on it so people who wants features will definitely stick to android and iphone owners will make switch as usual
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple now days always try to make things better and with every year they will always be back more im not entirely sure if anyone else who has the means to make switch but in my opinion personally think the iphone pro max should do the job better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,why should care when these people nowadays are being nonsensical if listen to those more apple now days always try to make things better and with every year they will always be backward with features and thats why we have many choices in android world but none in the iphone one
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,which iphone do you used is it reliable enough in year to year yes iphones are very reliable they are good more than one year or years use pro max and its still get in
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,indeed only the pro models are getting the hz display from hz which is used in ult more which iphone do you used is it reliable enough in year to year
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,thats honestly pretty bad imo my old iphone plus was at after years have bought that brand new on lanuch date till now its battery health with original battery
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,hi wait for iphone it will be available after tomorrow thanks greetings from france eder actually there isnt going to be an iphone butvin my honest opinion think the iphone range should likely be an improvement over the iphone range such as smaller notch hz ltpo display always on etc but the biggest change is the battery capacity which would likely be larger as well as the pro max which could practically last you through day with single charge even after days
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,same thing happened with the iphone which they got rid of the home button to let you scan more hi wait for iphone it will be available after tomorrow thanks greetings from france eder
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yeah thats what said above him like before but they adopt an ltpo display to scale more indeed only the pro models are getting the hz display from hz which is used in ultra and oneplus pro
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,phone this size doesnt even have mah battery there is thing called optimization they do it to save battery life and save money and dont go for big batteries because it will give you whole day battery without any hiccups
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,dont know why they delayed it but looks like it didnt pass their perfection test so same thing happened with the iphone which they got rid of the home button to let you scan your face using face recognition im surprised that the iphone range isnt going to get touch id all because of so called crapdemic that ruins peoples lives after what to expect to see in
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,yeah right but they could at least put it in display with the pro models so it would be more dont know why they delayed it but looks like it didnt pass their perfection test so
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,touch id will probably come next year as still apple is testing the fingerprint for making it more yeah right but they could at least put it in display with the pro models so it would be welcoming move
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,thats great phone ever iphone pro max will be more better than iphone pro max smaller notch hz ltpo display bigger battery improved camera setup but we missed the touch id
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,which one is iphone plus it nice phone but the battery must be terrifying
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,had same with iphone xs brand new had it about months before sold it and it was down more thats honestly pretty bad imo my old iphone plus was at after years
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,do just go ahead and buy this or do wait for the pro max or the pro max or whatever more which one is iphone plus
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,can someone explain to me why my friend ip pro max after check its imei the expired date more havent experienced any issues about the warranty being earlier than usual but maybe its because its out of warranty and technology has evolved faster the iphone pro max will likely have these improvements over the predecessor which gets to have bigger batteries hz ltpo oled display always on retina display decent cameras and smaller notch the standard iphone will lack the third telephoto lens lidar sensor hz ltpo and always on display
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,punch holes ok and personally like huaweis idea on putting tof in it to make the more yeah but im hugely disappointed that huawei is cancelled the and mate range due to global shortage
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,this is most choice for some people but prefer way android better
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,never was an iphone ios fan and have been an android user since though had an ipod before that and nokia before that as well but android is way better for me but because the nature of my job being web developer and our client mostly are using apple products was forced to use an iphone to compensate for my multiple project test and such given that find the environment quite good not superb compared to my note ultra but still great for what it is made for
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,or maybe they have different needs wants or likes but think its about time to addre more punch holes ok and personally like huaweis idea on putting tof in it to make the face scanner safer
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,under display finger print reader on progress in there iphones the question is this year more iphones will get indisplay fingerprint sensor as this year it will be update so they will only have change in notch refresh rate and minor camera improvements
Apple,iPhone 12 Pro Max,apple will not do this how are you so sure mean theyve already added side mounted one in the ipad air
Apple,iPhone 13,is the phone new or used is the phone work in middle east and africa you can still get brand new they work well in globally thats the model you should look for
Apple,iPhone 13,does ios support airdrop apps telegram airdrops and misses browser
Apple,iPhone 13,about meeting at home because till now not sure can will send you the money have to can do that have no one else to iot the account number was the to the door to understand the other is great experience to be good fit for you and your family very good time with you guys to the account is in the hospital would like to get quote from the door is the best way possible to get the other ones are lot of people whom it was pleasure meeting you if have to get the other end if this bring to you if you have to go through all the other is locked the front door to get good idea to the garage is good day at home because would be
Apple,iPhone 13,really want this iphone because my father need this iphone for my family because knew that phone to come back then because my phone want the iphone for free because it changed my life to talk to my mum and dad
Apple,iPhone 13,bought new and since that have login my icloud on it if receive call it only shows nu more sign up
Apple,iPhone 13,please have question will be able to still use face scanning for bank stuffs or opening of account if am using an iphone with face id
Apple,iPhone 13,is iphone support physical sim yeah
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone pro max is iphone support physical sim
Apple,iPhone 13,want bigger phone iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13,iphones are overrated like bmws and tiktok
Apple,iPhone 13,still keep sellimg this in middle east
Apple,iPhone 13,the last notch design from iphone with dual cam flip hahaha
Apple,iPhone 13,so ive been locked out of my iphone for couple of months not somehow my phone is getting calls or making how is this possible if have to go to apple to get it factory reset got the number changed so couldnt go on the internet an do anything with it till got the new number in the mail by then bill went to collections
Apple,iPhone 13,it cant the iphone is using mah battery while the samsung is using mah battery iphone havent it is mah battery
Apple,iPhone 13,is it normal for my iphone to have battery health after months of use because more yes cause my iphone ended up at per after months of use
Apple,iPhone 13,in phone camera not so good call recording not available call history only day and also hanging problem
Apple,iPhone 13,haha if the quality of iphone isnt upto mark why dont stick to toy phones
Apple,iPhone 13,worst phone because the quality of the product is not good purchased midnight black and now its colour is changing the product body is not good they need to improve the quality of the colour coating its ridiculous that they say waterproof and dust resistantbut its not worth buying this product they are charging us high fee then manufactured the cheapest material
Apple,iPhone 13,need suggestions or pro
Apple,iPhone 13,so the battery can blow up after year of use samsung phones are garbage quality look at this one have you heard the news of it
Apple,iPhone 13,full charge on cable requires minutes which is bit absurd as the iphone reaches in minutes and the last charge require additional minutes to top off this is because in settings there is something called optimised battery charging to reduce battery ageing iphone learns from your daily charging routine so it can wait to finish charging past until you need to use it
Apple,iPhone 13,what should buy iphone or iphone good choice
Apple,iPhone 13,go for it bluntly so the battery can blow up after year of use samsung phones are garbage quality
Apple,iPhone 13,need suggestions should buy or iphone go for it bluntly
Apple,iPhone 13,hi actually same issue which am going through make sure you check your background data and battery access for each app also go through your siri settings as by default siri is active for almost all apps installed which find pointless for most apps that dont require siri integration have you checked things like if you email is set yo push or pull never have emails psuhed as it seems to always be looking in the background for emails if you dont need or is weak then switch to within your network settings otherwise it is case of fine tuning your phone to what you need on and what you can either disable or just run only when you are opening the app or service yourself lot of stuff is on by default and some of that stuff really isnt needed to be always on or automatic am medium light user emails social media web browsing camera spreadsheets etcno gaming and could easily get full day and half out of one charge when had my iphone standardnow am using pixel because fancied change but do miss how good iphone ui is
Apple,iPhone 13,recently got the regular iphone and its been weeks since got it the camera is amazin more hi actually same issue which am going through
Apple,iPhone 13,obviously you havent tried the samsung ultra macro hold up against your jeans and more you obviously havent used real quality macro then because lets just keep assuming things before asking ive been with samsung flagships since and got iphone as second device by the way this is an iphone section and compared to real camera samsung suck in every department dont assume someone hasnt had experience with brand just because you have nothing to add to the argument real macro lens on real camera beats phones hands down its just phones pamper to the people who just want bright saturated shots out the boxbut go and try to print that image on some like size at or so dpi
Apple,iPhone 13,thanks
Apple,iPhone 13,its not macro mode and the pro models have af in altra wideeither way macro on phone more obviously you havent tried the samsung ultra macro hold up against your jeans and you will see every thread
Apple,iPhone 13,its interesting
Apple,iPhone 13,in which world does flagship means it must have every features all other phones have some jus more and like he said if they really want that they could easily go for cheaper budget android phone that ticks the boxes im not spending that amount of money just to get just normal phone that does things nothing special if im paying that amount of money expect the highest quality possible then again iphone fanboys are brainwashed and trapped if get into it it will harder to leave
Apple,iPhone 13,tell me that when android solved all issue of notification not shown due to bugoverzealous ba more lol just because you bought cheap buggy android doesnt make all android phones buggy
Apple,iPhone 13,very good phone even has some of the features that are only supposed to be on the pro models more its not macro mode and the pro models have af in altra wideeither way macro on phones suck for proper quality macro showing high fidelity details we need higher mp than mp and hopefully with good physical sized sensor any digital even budget one when attached to real macro lens like my old sigma mm prime macro or any better lenses will blow away anything phones can do you can pick up dslr dirt cheap in second hand market if new isnt your thing
Apple,iPhone 13,best iphone super cool
Apple,iPhone 13,im pretty sure no apple employees reads comments if they did they wouldnt be more true
Apple,iPhone 13,wonder how people keeps emphasizing on the fact that iphone battery last longer than an andr more it cant the iphone is using mah battery while the samsung is using mah battery
Apple,iPhone 13,selfie camera does not have an autofocus right serious
Apple,iPhone 13,apple is ok but the keep using the same design from to no difference it is just nasty com on change the damn design im just waiting for to launch
Apple,iPhone 13,no macro samples only the pro can shoot macro photos vivo the selfie camera is with fixed focus
Apple,iPhone 13,is security patches that important theyre overrated as hell its not like youre gonna downl more is security patches that important theyre overrated as hell hilarious expired root cert signed your os updates years ago no problem security patches arent important now you get free updates from whoever owns your phone not you btw
Apple,iPhone 13,never trust on the display of iphone have numerous hairline scratches all around the display since left it is now had to invest on the gadgetshieldz screen protectors to cover the scratches
Apple,iPhone 13,android is even more simpler than ios and everything just works without having to jump through more tell me that when android solved all issue of notification not shown due to bugoverzealous battery management which happen in almost every brand
Apple,iPhone 13,thats only because you are only viewing things from your perspective there are people who pre more android is even more simpler than ios and everything just works without having to jump through ten different steps come back when ios gets proper file management
Apple,iPhone 13,samsung making the displays doesnt mean apple dont have anything to do with the way these end more apple dont have anything to do with it they simply order based on their specifications and requirements samsung is the one delivering only thing apple has control over is quality control checks they are failing in that department too
Apple,iPhone 13,even budget devices offer smoothly and troublefree experience these days and he never menti more im not saying everyone using android is flashing im just stating examples that everyone uses their devices differently there are advance user who do flashing and there are also people that just want simple devices that works and is getting updated few years down there just things that android phones doesnt offer while iphone does and vice versa so its just plain blind ignorant to claim one is superior to the other and btw im android user for all can remember but do see merit in iphone being superior in some way
Apple,iPhone 13,think ill wait for the pixel pro instead
Apple,iPhone 13,ultra exynos is great please dont spread lies new updates have seen great improvem more those flagships have already matched the overall feature set and offer lot more than samsung flagship all that at lower price there is reason why samsung was toppled from the no spot in india the last great phone from samsung was the galaxy note ultra comes close but the exynos variant is still behind the snapdragon variant even after updates
Apple,iPhone 13,or iphone pro pro max you have good sense of humor
Apple,iPhone 13,huawei is bad example here they are the only company that copy that ugly notch for more you are incorrect huawei may have copied apples notch like all others did but they did it best because they gave you the option to hide it or keep it apple did not do that score huawei apple
Apple,iPhone 13,some people dont want to to be trapped with ios yeah true im one of those as prefer the flexibility of android phones and the extra choice of brands however lots of people love ios as well where live google is banned so it is lot more hardship to use android as everything has to be sideloaded whereas ios is lot more straight forward dont mind using workarounds to install and use apks but think lot of people wont want the hassle
Apple,iPhone 13,damn android makers has to think about how to utilise the resources they have instead of increasing numbers everywhere possible which is under utilised look at the battery life having such small battery yet it has delivered much more than other flagships which has much bigger battery dont know how much impact resolution has on it but iphones other android flagships has almost same pixels to power the os hw optimisations is what missing in android same goes for multi tasking but not sure whether both os has same multitasking capabilities apple could hold more apps than android with gb ram
Apple,iPhone 13,no thank you iphones are not my cup of tea android flagship feel like few generations ahe more yeah always go for android phones myself but can understand why some people might prefer iphones
Apple,iPhone 13,poco with is not giving slowdowns or lag while the iphone with the topoftheline more first of all poco doesnt come up with it comes with and snapdragon for pro model which costs more second of all have used iphone pro and optimization is not there they rolled out half baked product yet again the refresh rate reaches maximum hz no smooth scrolling no optimization for third party apps doesnt reach hz when it should because of poor optimization by apple poco not having ltpo stays at hz most of the times except in video player where it drops to hz and offers smooth hz premium feel every time you touch it
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post who cares who is in charge people just enjoy their devices it is an individual choice find it silly that people are still debating ios vs android one thing is clear every company out there is making profits just that apple has the highest profits while people here criticizefight over apple it is just laughing all the way to the bank am neither an ios or android fan buy devices which like for my needs my comment on hz was from an average user perspective have an iphone and apple watch previously had note ssss nexus oneplus honor plus iphone iphone moto
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post poco with is not giving slowdowns or lag while the iphone with the topoftheline chipset is biggest joke of the year tell me have you even used an iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,before spending the money no matter how much it is will do compare any comparative phones more sometimes you take gamble trusting the hype and glorified reviews and you lose
Apple,iPhone 13,since you are from india can you recommend me which flagship phone to buy this festival seaso more are you looking for budget flagship or proper flagship there are plenty of options between rs kk for budget flagships the list and choice on android as usual is too long if you want proper flagship avoid the overpriced ultra with exynos whose camera and thermal performance is weaker compared to its snapdragon counterpart depending on your needs and preferences you can make your choice between mi ultra oneplus pro vivo pro
Apple,iPhone 13,that would actually depends on what emphasis you want iphone aint about being the best more iphone are appealing to those not looking at paper specs and just want things to work things just work is the biggest lie on ios things just dont work as easy as android besides if you just want basic things to work then you might as well go and buy budget phone everything just works on those phones too plenty of people happy with their devices but we are talking about flagships here flagship must live up to the level of being called flagship have owned several products as mentioned and found the whole ios ecosystem to be overrated and its claims by these so called tech punditz to be highly unreliable
Apple,iPhone 13,to let you know thirdparty repair of this phone is completely impossible if you crack your screen only apple can repair if the front facing camera fails only apple can repair logic board replacement only apple can repair if you replace anything even with apple original product from another phone you are out of luck something will not work anymore like faceid brightness etc etc break your phone only apple can fix it this eco friendly company is not so ecofriendly as you think
Apple,iPhone 13,still using lightning port the lightning por hast stayed the same since the iphone but considering that people have criticized apple for not bring the usb port to the iphone only machooks and ipad pros do have usb port but the iphone doesnt so dont take this reply too seriously
Apple,iPhone 13,louis mentioned this but still has to be said the new iphone has one of the highest quality cameras and video recording capability but is still using decade old transfer speeds technology lightening while super convenient in terms of connecting it hasnt improved since and you still have very slow transfer speeds compared to usb
Apple,iPhone 13,its inferior according to him in my opinion its great phone let him keep his trash xiaomi yes its his opinion thats the point
Apple,iPhone 13,the xiaomi lite ne is supported for until sept has hrr all hdr formats unlike more supported until nah man it only gets os updates and years on nonuseful updates
Apple,iPhone 13,cant you read he clearly stated that the iphone pro max was an inferior product even the owner of the comment understood what my reply means and the proof if heshe understood is that heshe reply me as well and you just ask me can you read it you may be the same person anonymousmaybe
Apple,iPhone 13,hz is so overrated ios is much smooth and normal user would not figure high refresh rat more overrated how so you havent even got it yet which suspect that you dont even own this phone if its true then no one cares what your opinion is
Apple,iPhone 13,you sony fan and big camera fanboy he wasnt even talking about sony phones
Apple,iPhone 13,in conclusion your wallet tell what you should buy from your comment if you really boug more cant you read he clearly stated that the iphone pro max was an inferior product
Apple,iPhone 13,have access to an iphone mini and noticed major camera issue when you take photo more noticed further camera issues even when you use exposure compensation sometimes the iphone camera makes the face of person brighter and more orange than it really is when you look at the live photo animation the face looks realistic also noticed that my hair looks artificial when someone takes portrait photo of me iso apple seems to use watercolor noise reduction which makes images look artificial
Apple,iPhone 13,the new non pro iphones are just subpar the hertz display alone is big reason why even more hz is so overrated ios is much smooth and normal user would not figure high refresh rate yes the hz panel is good to have but iphone otherwise offers well rounded phone that works well for most users and you also get years of support cheaper androids have poor sw implementations android is more like specs race without refinement am sure many will jump on this comment as has been the norm on this site
Apple,iPhone 13,this new colour reminds me of the pinksand model of the nokia
Apple,iPhone 13,this site is pretty nice but has so much toxicity in the comment section its unreal yes and it has always been like that
Apple,iPhone 13,then what for apple adding hz to iphone propro max if everything already smooth li more mean its even smoother in hz
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post unoptimized ha how so oh except for the week long software bug android has plenty of those bugs too
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post samsung gives natrual output mean oversaturated output big jokeee has been caught
Apple,iPhone 13,android better specs better experience low price ios outdated specs handicapped ex more better experience hah the best selling android phones were the least good in specforprice even worse than the iphones theyre just cheap
Apple,iPhone 13,in the past couple of years samsung image processing is leaning towards less saturated colors more they have gotten better but definitely nowhere near one of the most natural looking
Apple,iPhone 13,do they also plan to give monthly security patches because not even ultra is updated mon more is security patches that important theyre overrated as hell its not like youre gonna download some videos from nsfw website security patches aint important cus it makes people not safe from those shit
Apple,iPhone 13,you need to get your eyes checked samsung give natural photo in the past couple of years samsung image processing is leaning towards less saturated colors than what they used to traditionally output and iphone which was known for natural accurate colors is producing output like samsung
Apple,iPhone 13,satisfy my need and the wallet sorry just make your sentence complete lol more ofcourse why should pay unnecessarily more for subpar device if iphone is perfect for you go and buy it its not for me dont be assuming wont buy chinese flagships if they are expensive than iphone am not swayed into the direction of subpar device just because someone else thinks buying phone for logo is good deal over an actually better device
Apple,iPhone 13,hardware of iphone pro gb costs
Apple,iPhone 13,nah everybody else judges product by how much of complete integrated and consistent pac more android better specs better experience low price ios outdated specs handicapped experience high price this is exactly why ios marketshare never went above in the last decade
Apple,iPhone 13,oh thats unfortunate goodluck tho are you jealous that some can do it or just spiteful am also inching toward the big iphone it seems like the perfect balance of what is currently available am just waiting to see the new pixel but am already not enamoured of the design plus am pretty disappointed with googles services right now as googlefi has become too buggy lately inability to make calls the voicemail tab has disappeared and most voicemails are unable to be transcribed might want to move to the ios ecosystem at this point because it just works
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone would be perfect smartphone if it had hz refresh rate you do realize that the pro versions of iphone already has hz panel which think that the panel is far better although it might drop down as low as hz to save battery life when reading ebooks but goes back to normal when the screen is tapped
Apple,iPhone 13,new iphone is design catastrophe that bezel is fugly cmon apple
Apple,iPhone 13,this review has convinced me to get the iphone oh thats unfortunate goodluck tho
Apple,iPhone 13,back then no money to buy apple phone now no money to buy any flagship phones
Apple,iPhone 13,poor battery hoax battery life is fine on the even on the pro max which lasts through the day without having to worry about it
Apple,iPhone 13,androids desperately need hz to hide the lag iphones are smooth for many years even on hz then what for apple adding hz to iphone propro max if everything already smooth like butter in hz
Apple,iPhone 13,it seems they still havent done anything to reduce the ghosting in the camera its ridiculous after all these years look at image the building with pektopat written and the other pic containing the same image its all over the place with all these rd thats just pathetic
Apple,iPhone 13,they are also the first one from the android crowd to implement faceidlike facial scanne more you sony fan and big camera fanboy
Apple,iPhone 13,poor battery
Apple,iPhone 13,please compare low light shots iso of the lower part of the dollar bill and especially the london subway map of iphone pro max iphone pro and samsung galaxy if the photos are correct then iphone images are far less usable accurate and natural compared to samsung
Apple,iPhone 13,poco more like poco costing works flawlessly dropping to hz only in videos no more working flawlessly and guess what tinting issues check the reviews and facebook
Apple,iPhone 13,most chinese phones also cut corners in software department especially xiaomi so take that int more the xiaomi lite ne is supported for until sept has hrr all hdr formats unlike iphones and few extra features
Apple,iPhone 13,yeah ill buy chinese flagship phone even if they are more expensive than iphones as more this is the problem with ios fans if its expensive it must be good thats their logic judge product based on how good it really is brand name doesnt matter for me these guys are married to their favorite brand apple which is why they cant digest someone leaving the ios ecosystem for greener pastures am not interested in spending above rsk for an inferior product made that mistake with the iphone pro max after lot of hype and reviews was disappointed eventually am not married to particular brand my loyalty is towards the best overall product on the market am not using subpar hardware and software of iphone just because it is expensive or comes from apple was looking forward to ultra but after the exynos disaster was in no mood to pay rsk for ultra then waited for the find pro which never released in my country so opted for the oneplus pro which is basically the same phone minus periscope lens and charging instead of paid for that then switched to mi ultra the following year paid for that would have happily paid and above for these devices some people here would think its not fair to spend on oneplus or xiaomi because its chinese brand have no such misconceptions and dont buy based on brand name but the quality of the product itself but some people are too influenced by some companys brand name or logo
Apple,iPhone 13,lol im sure that you wouldnt buy chinese phones if they were actually more expens more yeah ill buy chinese flagship phone even if they are more expensive than iphones as know id be guaranteed my moneys worth something know isnt going to possible when using the iphone which part of the globe are you trapped in is it north america also which era are you trapped in this isnt year when people were still skeptical of buying chinese phones in the west and dont care what phone huawei ceo uses tomorrow if he starts using basic phone youll do the same buy devices that satisfy my needs dont buy based on what some random irrelevant celebrity is using btw the iphone is also made in china in similar factories as other smartphones stop looking at the logo and judge these devices on honest basis
Apple,iPhone 13,everytime there are articles about iphone particulatly and there are rooms for opinionscomments there are persons who do not like or even hate iphone and or compare it with android ones it is apples biz no matter how you dislikehate iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,what do you mean exactly by cheapest quality ive got and my next phone more there is no such thing as an iphone display all these panels are from samsung
Apple,iPhone 13,midrange android like poco have working hz oled display and emphasize the word quo more poco more like poco costing works flawlessly dropping to hz only in videos no need for ltpo and one still gets hr sot what else you need
Apple,iPhone 13,cant justify upgrading from android due to the fact apple failed to make all new models with more huawei is bad example here they are the only company that copy that ugly notch for no reason they even make deeper notch than apple
Apple,iPhone 13,if iphones are that cheap why do them cost more than chinese phones to be made the iphon more do you even understand how much money samsung and apple save by using in house processors and other stuff chinese manufacturers always have to pay more for samsung screens or camera sensors than when samsung uses them for their in house devices simpler things like ip rating is cheaper for companies that already getting the certification for bulk of their devices like apple an samsung the quality of apple and high end chinese flagships is same their bom is similar its just that samsung and apple choose to charge more for more profits
Apple,iPhone 13,no need to educate people who deny the fact that cheap phones indeed have cheap quality if more turned off ads on my phone and didnt receive single ad since then it has been already two years
Apple,iPhone 13,the cheapest quality flagships on the markets are iphones chinese brands put their heart and more lol im sure that you wouldnt buy chinese phones if they were actually more expensive than iphones youll simply forget that heart and soul concept and yes huawei ceo himself uses iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone camera havent improved at all since iphone pro max other than no night mode photos they all same processing same al even then night mode they look exactly the same
Apple,iPhone 13,the improvements are more tactical than anything else id imagine the changes are just peacemeal because they had to get phone out this year we can only take rumours at face value however if the introduction of sidemounted fingerprint reader is the way forward then what else could be in store notchless design
Apple,iPhone 13,galaxy series is super popular moto series as well everytime see someone comment more you can download it on almost any device includeing devices other than xiaomi using an app called gcamator
Apple,iPhone 13,realme users we do oneplus users so do we nokia users what about us galaxy series more only redmi note users do it have seen it tested on flagships like oneplus and samsung series way less than of the photos were better not worth it is only effective on very cheaper phones because brands do not give software polished as the one for expensive phone brands simply do not care those flagships perform much worse than the phones from same brand even with same cpu same isp and when use same cam reno pro does not match find both with sdimx
Apple,iPhone 13,more like nobody else gets gcam as its available for the most popular phones galaxy series is super popular moto series as well everytime see someone comment to have gcam it is xiaomi user
Apple,iPhone 13,wow gsmarena listening to nier replicant soundtrack thats nice all day long big nier replicantautomata fan here
Apple,iPhone 13,pro with barely pass fps for this game how phones with can run well accordi more it is kept locked at fps in that game by default by the manufacturer to prevent the snapdragon from throttling you can run it in unlocked high performance mode where the fps cap gets removed
Apple,iPhone 13,only xiaomi users install gcam on their phones nobody else cares more like nobody else gets gcam as its available for the most popular phones
Apple,iPhone 13,gsmarena can you please add low light portrait and bokeh balls test it would be much appreciated
Apple,iPhone 13,bought an iphone few months ago would never go back to androids with flash new technolog more so you bought phone that isnt even out months ago huh think not
Apple,iPhone 13,great allround photo and video quality across all three cameras are you kidding me ultrawide camera shots at night are simply terrible
Apple,iPhone 13,features and value yes they use cheap materials to make cheap phones and they pretty much do more no need to educate people who deny the fact that cheap phones indeed have cheap quality if phones are too cheap then where will the manufacturer gets revenue from xiaomi have to resort to forced ads which can be turned off but will automatically turn on in months dont buy phones with ads
Apple,iPhone 13,im no fan of the iphone but even can see that their soc is way ahead of everyone else more here can agree apple knows silicon their soc and battery life are insane now the display and cameras are up there too this is rock solid phone the iphone pro series are really best overall smartphone not like the series that had smaller battery than the series and the soc was little bit hot the is so much better than in terms of handle the heat and the battery
Apple,iPhone 13,ngl the new iphones daylight photo quality seems to be much better than before have more disagree
Apple,iPhone 13,what can tell form looking at the photos taken with the is that the processing is not even close to pixel phone if you zoom into photos you will see white lines and staircase effects along all edges which basically means the processing is creating fake details and the dynamic range is worse than the iphone series what is going on with apple
Apple,iPhone 13,like it or not dong troll xiaomis much cheaper phones stomp all over iphones in terms more features and value yes they use cheap materials to make cheap phones and they pretty much dont pay any engineers to design their product because they copy everything from the competition
Apple,iPhone 13,even though cna only say one thing rhta isapple sucks the iphone mini are bad compa more no one cares the reviews are pretty good
Apple,iPhone 13,and also noticed in ultrawide night time shots with night mode auto turned on there is an extreme blue tint near the main building in the st photo and the st and nd photo of selfie cam had this yellowish tint too
Apple,iPhone 13,true its just bit hazy look at the building even my sub mediatek phone takes more only xiaomi users install gcam on their phones nobody else cares
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone better than iphone pro max youre not very convincing tech blogger if you more you must try to hold it in your hand you will find difference between iphone and iphone its totally sleek and borders are more defined as well
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post iphone better than iphone pro max youre not very convincing tech blogger if you think thats the case
Apple,iPhone 13,regarding video quality really wanted to be excited when read the video quality from the main camera is spectacular the detail is excellent but looking at the provided sample in the video compare tool the detail looks lacking compared to the vanilla am missing something
Apple,iPhone 13,its surprising how they managed to make no improvement in still image quality over iphon more the improvements are more tactical than anything else
Apple,iPhone 13,this phone wouldve been mesmerizing had it had some of the tantalizing amenities that are only found in android phones
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post aaa media was fanboying around android as an os he never said anything about xiaomi in this comment section but yeah get it you do seem to love xiaomi more than anybody else on this website so its totally understandable that you cant help mention them
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post yes lithuania making up lies dont recall india saying anything about xiaomi phones only about some of their apps which were pretty much lies as well
Apple,iPhone 13,what about lithuania also india has reported many faults with xiaomi phones people dont more what about lithuania what country that is having an increasingly more dreadful relationship with china do you genuinely believe that report was not at all part of their political tactics
Apple,iPhone 13,youre wrong im no fan of the iphone but even can see that their soc is way ahead of everyone else and the us blocking huawei from making their chips just lessens the competition in the soc race
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post like it or not dong troll xiaomis much cheaper phones stomp all over iphones in terms of features and value so much so governments have to make up lies about them to keep people buying iphones
Apple,iPhone 13,five years support is good if you are one of those people who doesnt change until broken keep in mind that you will be in the iphones golden cage ecosystem with battery health dropping with each new update that you get for myself speed camera and the battery was the only thing that liked about the standard iphone no pro or max as it seems battery is no more and dont like it at all
Apple,iPhone 13,am thinking about this one and iphone pro max what do you guys think can have them more get the new iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,yes minor upgrade thats why max and pro are best selling in the lineup
Apple,iPhone 13,apple is still king when it comes to processing power no company is coming close to replicati more youre wrong
Apple,iPhone 13,power to do what exactly ios has better apps including better games and productivity tools more apple is still king when it comes to processing power no company is coming close to replicating the performanceefficiency of their cpu cores and now their gpus are killing the competition as well they are basically miles ahead of the best designs from arm which soc makers like qualcomm samsung and mediatek base their soc designs on the only way these soc makers can catch up is to ditch generic arm cpugpu designs and implement their own custom cores and gpus which qualcomm and samsung are reportedly going to do but even then itll take years to perfect their design in bid to take down apple
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post power to do what exactly ios has better apps including better games and productivity tools it has uniformity between the different cameras thats unheard of on the android side and it has arguably better processing power actually use an android for work and pretty much as daily driver but the stupidity and ignorance of some android fannies is getting really annoying
Apple,iPhone 13,lol still stuck in with that ancient hz rr they keep this at hz to push buyers towards buying the more profitable pro models it also helps with battery life which is not great even though its still hz
Apple,iPhone 13,does iphone support night mode portrait
Apple,iPhone 13,that colour is so pretty
Apple,iPhone 13,must be the most boring new phone launch in living memory supremely yawn inducing nah id argue the xs series deserves that title people are complaining that this years is boring but at least theres few new things in design and performance battery and cameras xs series literally only had brighter screens and slightly better cameras
Apple,iPhone 13,and in real world heavy games like genshin impact two year old snapdragon giving more ave more pro with barely pass fps for this game how phones with can run well according to you
Apple,iPhone 13,that geekench though sammy boi and every android oem left in dust wow just wow you guys more and in real world heavy games like genshin impact two year old snapdragon giving more average framerate with minimal frame drops apple engineers forgot to give proper cooling system to extract the most out of the benchmark paper champion
Apple,iPhone 13,the new iphone was producing the same results as iphone but at lowered iso settings could be handy in low light situations however the details in iphone night photos are completely obliterated which is shame really bad
Apple,iPhone 13,small blizzard cores working at ghz with turboboost capability to go to ghz whe more maybe they meant the larger avalanche cores that can go up to ghz
Apple,iPhone 13,sometimes the grass is good and leaves look fine other times they are awfully smeared more but apple cameras have best consistency no
Apple,iPhone 13,the night mode artifacts look terrible when there are moving objects see the third image fr more true its just bit hazy look at the building even my sub mediatek phone takes much better nighttime photos with gcam just wish ois was present to help but sadly it is still rare in that pricesegment
Apple,iPhone 13,thats true just reread the review and it feels rushed and bit shoddy with sligh more well ofc when you pay so much for damn phone who wouldnt nitpick even the get most of the basics right but obv these highend phones need to be looked at with more scrutiny except if its bleeding edge like the fold and then it can be cut some slack
Apple,iPhone 13,when comparing to iphone and pro battery life which has better battery the pro acc to some early testing with the unoptimized rr handling
Apple,iPhone 13,the lens remains the same its not the same lens the iphone has mm more thats true just reread the review and it feels rushed and bit shoddy with slight negative nitpicking bias seeping through absent from the reviews of lesser devices too bad have generally really liked the reviews here
Apple,iPhone 13,good review its really very solid and wellthoughtthrough device am waiting for to see the pixel before pull the trigger and decide if should go back to ios miss it dont see the foliage issues mentioned the iphone shots look more natural than my current xiaomis which is not bad on its own
Apple,iPhone 13,helpful review the pink color looks great like strawberry icecream
Apple,iPhone 13,damn im looking at your camera comparison tool and the iphone looks better in low light than the theres so much processing in action oversharpening that shouldnt be done with larger sensor hope they improve it over time because thats nasty regression
Apple,iPhone 13,people who have or pro see no reason to upgrade to this promax yes nice upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13,the haters are gonna hate and the funboys will love poetry
Apple,iPhone 13,whats the point of commenting on the battery life when by the next update it gets worse everyone was raving about the battery life on the note ultra got it and it barely lasts by sunset on single charge
Apple,iPhone 13,wow great review the best just got better
Apple,iPhone 13,when you say uninspiring standby for battery its bit unclear can you please compare with any more total time of the test seems to be video internet call standby you just need to do the math with the data
Apple,iPhone 13,could someone tell me if iphone has free navigation have never had an iphone so far and if more in canada it can record never tried but it says itll play warning message if switched to some eu countries think its not possible really dont like those locked down limited enshyticated things they all go that way ms googol apple samsung im genx lot of nostalgia when we all had whats called freedom
Apple,iPhone 13,great chipset great storage and great camera ts phone is lit yes buy some as soon as you can before good used ones cant be found anymore pictures not my best dont look beautifulizer for me but its ok they have details they look quite real battery awesome for browse and normal use except modem if bad reception also ios annoyances and lock down spying you ll have to put up with android not any better nowadays they going the wrong all the way too surprised of performance too it holds up sure no great gaming no fancy ai and dont want that no pretentious tempered benchmarks better than the new ones for same price imho also those small size they are disappearing
Apple,iPhone 13,im surprised how that phone holds up in battery is very very good compare to say especially in browsing which is my main use modem drops much power though and gaming no pictures are ok iphone over sharp bland not very beautiful for me but they have lot details look cleaan for what that means fact samsung makes everything more beautiful whereas iphones makes everything more ugly on pictures then can argue about shadows real colors but who cares really dont like sharpening its old trick from bit low colors palate computer looks very digital hz doesnt bother me much neither the face id bar what bothers me lot is ios but android is taking same path locking down everything spying forcing cloudshyt non disabled annoyances hidding many shenanigans in the core os so bought few old phone in premium shape for not much more than battery replacement and ill see what will be in three or more years because right now its all very expensive boring shyytes which are released air ai and all those bs spyware and useless tdp proc tensoshit gpu
Apple,iPhone 13,is green screen comes to iphone only the pro and pro max versions
Apple,iPhone 13,even tho it has mp my friend has one and it was mid blowing like just said my had decent camera and he popped up ultra high diff realistic camera imagine the pro max

Apple,iPhone 13,still worth to buy it in got an apple watch series and cannot work with my samsung more think its worth if you get nice deal on it got one last month at great price and its great to be honest yeah it could be better but it doesnt mean that its bad but look for too if you can get one at great price but the is still good
Apple,iPhone 13,anyone selling in reasonable price
Apple,iPhone 13,the iphone is far better send me even usd buy one ive been reading the reviews since lol
Apple,iPhone 13,hmm its okay
Apple,iPhone 13,said pro didnt you said the series so thought you were talking about the vanilla the pro is more expensive than the even though it has slower chip with less updates
Apple,iPhone 13,the iphone series is not much better than the series yet is almost dollars more get more the iphone is only like more expensive than the and it has gb of storage vs
Apple,iPhone 13,gb ram having apps still crashes from ram is crazy wont be surprise if this phone crashes because of just the ram
Apple,iPhone 13,gb ram in flagship my budget phone from got gb ram lol try to compare your gb ram to gb on ip
Apple,iPhone 13,seriously hope this is ragebait but ive seen like dumber takes on this website today xiaomi agent
Apple,iPhone 13,does anyone else find the blue one looks bit like teal its like it has greenish hin more maybe slightly if the light is just right
Apple,iPhone 13,nah oppo reno sucks can get the xiaomi pro with gb storage for the same price as more this phone is useless no screen you serious just get redmi note for half the price with better camera better screen better operating system and bigger size absolute scam apple only sells the name iphone if not the name the phone is crappy
Apple,iPhone 13,bought it week ago best purchase for me gb for daily use is superb
Apple,iPhone 13,haved an phone yet
Apple,iPhone 13,overall this is the best iphone to buy cost is is available for very good price camera its good camera for daily uses good photos and videos battery enough battery for day support still plenty of support pending considering cost have pm but find this phone gem to use
Apple,iPhone 13,since the last ios update after the update is finished recommend to restart your phone one more time my iphone is going crazy fast it feels super smooth and the apps are running very well the bug for the horizontal line in photos is gone now that was annoying also the battery duration improves despite my battery life have over of battery in the evening in the same conditions before ios update for an years old phone im very pleased
Apple,iPhone 13,from price performance point of view this is probably the best iphone with oled screen since updating the ios do not have the battery drain issues reported in this platform
Apple,iPhone 13,once again the current ios has ruined my battery life used to come home from work in the percent now its around percent if it wasnt for the kids having iphones would change but imessage and facetime is too easy
Apple,iPhone 13,it is my dream phone since my other phones sucked hope can get ur dreamer phone sooner
Apple,iPhone 13,if still worth it wanna buy one yes mate it is for normal gaming and casual uses its def worth it got one in the late december th gets updates till or and it will still support apps till so its good one and worth it remember even iphone plus supports till now even though its updates are stopped way before
Apple,iPhone 13,your iphone may be more powerful than switch but does it have masterpieces like mario kart more they could only play those with competent phone an android
Apple,iPhone 13,my iphone is fastest than nintendo switch oled for both launch release since your iphone may be more powerful than switch but does it have masterpieces like mario kart deluxe super mario odyssey zelda totk xenoblade witcher doom eternal and persona royal
Apple,iPhone 13,have owned iphone much powerful gaming than nintendo switch oled and previous xbox one more sorry mean nintendo switch shader core and gigaflops however my iphone still loved too powerful gaming experience
Apple,iPhone 13,gonna buy this phone on the nd of march so excitedd
Apple,iPhone 13,bro this phone is overpriced coz you can just get the oppo reno and android is better nah oppo reno sucks can get the xiaomi pro with gb storage for the same price as the iphone with only gb storage
Apple,iPhone 13,which phone has better stereo speakers iphone or pro please someone tell me
Apple,iPhone 13,just buy iphone gb its good phone pay in my country about and that is the che more same price as in indonesia online stores
Apple,iPhone 13,this is one of my best iphones so far should be upgrading to iphone next yeari just love the camera style
Apple,iPhone 13,this is just like tecno pop
Apple,iPhone 13,this ice just equivalent to tecno pop
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone also has scratch resistant screen
Apple,iPhone 13,is enough or ill go for the
Apple,iPhone 13,the best deal could find for brand new iphone with gb storage is look on place called back market it is place to buy refurbished tech
Apple,iPhone 13,this was the best year of iphone say you want midranger get the regular want budget get the mini want flagship get the pro want big flagship get the pro max reliable phones with good specs
Apple,iPhone 13,even after years the iphone is one of the best phones in the range its camera more the best deal could find for brand new iphone with gb storage is
Apple,iPhone 13,my recommendation is that you just update to ios because it is good for battery health bec more there goes your storage space downhill
Apple,iPhone 13,not in late which is almost going to be iphone will soon be years old not that soon after whole year to be precise
Apple,iPhone 13,gb variant is enough in todays world no try and go for the gb version
Apple,iPhone 13,wait on network specs still have nsasa support nice mobile used
Apple,iPhone 13,and are still both plenty fast enough and most poor people not specifically about this expensive phone but poor people depend on the cheap plans that immediately roll over to free data because and are so fast you dont even notice the data being utterly wasted on such things like yt autoloading when is more than fine for even in phone screens
Apple,iPhone 13,in data we cant switch to in iphone but it have bands am switching because to redu more were not in anymore lol if you want to save data restrict background access on apps you dont use use data saving modes whenever possible dont download too many stuff dont stream videos at and set data limit
Apple,iPhone 13,yes there is translucent line which is barely visible and mostly it happens in gallery my friend got the same issue after software update but on galaxy the translucent line seemed to disappear after couple days but several more days later this happened to his phones display out of nowhere httpsencryptedtbngstaticcomimagesqtbnandgctdbglzogsaposzdozinlaiiqyaefpvwstnpeblhjuyeaisms
Apple,iPhone 13,have you seen any display issue after update your iphone yes there is translucent line which is barely visible and mostly it happens in gallery
Apple,iPhone 13,currently am on ios ver has anybody updated to ios ver how is the performance more updated to ios month ago its fine but sometimes there is few hiccups just navigating thru the system
Apple,iPhone 13,for me se look ugly because of camerai preffer iphone design because looks like more is all we need prefer look not fish eyes
Apple,iPhone 13,but se will have type whereas this still uses lightning carrying two cables is inconvenient yup waiting for se usb
Apple,iPhone 13,guys is iphone worth to buy not in late which is almost going to be iphone will soon be years old
Apple,iPhone 13,still good phone but heavy users might struggle due to battery and ram capacity rather reco more for me se look ugly because of camerai preffer iphone design because looks like seriesand will buy iphone becuase dont have money for newer
Apple,iPhone 13,have use plenty of phones from samsung series to iphone think in my opinion if you are bored from android you can switch to iphone it gives you premium experience and it has everything which samsung or other brands doesnt have source trust me
Apple,iPhone 13,if you want it now try getting it for in the amazon india sale upcoming thank me later
Apple,iPhone 13,is the camera quality good am thinking to buy ip or should go for mean both are the same except the ip got gb ram but its up to you
Apple,iPhone 13,can anyone has any ides between samsung series or iphone have samsung and my wife has an iphone we both like and prefer our respective phones and both sizes are similar both are good but the has better battery life
Apple,iPhone 13,worth it for
Apple,iPhone 13,guys this or google pixel have them both prefer pixel pixel advantages over iphone from my perspective better photo quality with the main camera and selfie camera faster interface friendly os with more features noticed much more less bugs than on iphone iphone advantages over pixel better videos recorded with all cameras better battery not by much better ultrawide camera in all scenarios camera interface much more fluid flat screen overheats less than pixel
Apple,iPhone 13,not sure why you feel the need to tell everybody here think its good than iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,this exactly copy goggle pixel you can see it pixel date iphone septem more the pixel is already retired and the iphone works as well as it did on the day of release
Apple,iPhone 13,hope my birthday got this present not sure why you feel the need to tell everybody here
Apple,iPhone 13,on ios performance is still pretty solid guess battery life is kinda underwhelming for me since mine is refurbished and just of battery health but still capable to endure hours of screen on times before reaching defends on what im doingmostly web brouwsing and gaming btwim pretty impressed
Apple,iPhone 13,not worth it imo the screen was hz which had to get used to great for average usage however battery life was also not good it would run out quite fast fastest have seen in new phone so far camera is great though and its also great for long term usage
Apple,iPhone 13,would the resale decline percentage on this vs iphone would be the same
Apple,iPhone 13,this or xiaomi for taking pictures and videos
Apple,iPhone 13,apparently ios just dropped but for now im not sure if there is any changesimprovement
Apple,iPhone 13,dennisphone jul this or iphone phone of course
Apple,iPhone 13,is this phone made in china
Apple,iPhone 13,recently am noticing some slowdown particularly when use keyboard there are few hiccups more what ios ive heard it works better with ios

Apple,iPhone 13,great
Apple,iPhone 13,yaskar
Apple,iPhone 13,have mine and it really great upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13,is the battery life good or should go with the pro max version
Apple,iPhone 13,do you think its worth it to go from pixel to this phone mostly for trying the ecos more if can got for pixel get everything but wireless charging but the quality makes up for that
Apple,iPhone 13,it sucks have samsung phone as well and it crashed all the time its years before now samsung is not like that
Apple,iPhone 13,battery is the main course for having this phone aside from that the performance level as well it never failed me lot budget friendly compare to pro only camera added
Apple,iPhone 13,so far used monthswhile watching the youtube video the screen suddenly blankout same problem faced my friends with pro edition of iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,thats what you may think but trust me the iphone way better battery life than the more what are you talking about note did had problems with battery and every phone was send back for replacment iphone didnt had problems with batteries iphones were getting decent battery life with or and every till then were miserable they werent mobile phones they were housefixed phones pathetic and and also plus types also charging joke iphone are like tv screens nothing else to do android phones are not safe yea right
Apple,iPhone 13,very worst personal hotspot connectivity useless function
Apple,iPhone 13,got my last april so far it never failed me from the cam toe the reso batt and the size got my new plus because of the size hope it would give me same toy experience
Apple,iPhone 13,hr sot hmmmm thought id get wish people would explain their usage do you have bluetooth and gps on do you play genshin amd watch youtube
Apple,iPhone 13,really my samsung is now more than years old and still feels like new in fact it see more samsung seems to get better as it gets older this explains how samsung fan brain works amazing job from samsung marketing and trolling army
Apple,iPhone 13,kid man dont be fanboy samsung has some better features than iphones way better always more what evidence you are taking lol we are not talking about note burning peoples house and being banned from airplanes right im in front of judge lmao everyone knows the samsung lag after month or so
Apple,iPhone 13,well my is telling me that need new battery even though its always been backup phone since new theres nothing wrong with the battery in my samsung is rubbish was with samsung for years nothing but trouble replaced times hardwear problems so in bought two iphone minis not problem battery is better calibrated than samsung smaller battery but lasts longer will buy iphone and iphone mini soon samsung overrated and their customer service is rubbish also
Apple,iPhone 13,this nationalism over phones is really petty just be happy you have fancy phone apple or sa more thats one thing we can all agree on
Apple,iPhone 13,this would have to rank amongst the most ridiculous posts that have ever read how gullible more what do you mean by elvis presley was killed by an exploding iphone he died in apple wasnt even making iphones back then what liarr you are
Apple,iPhone 13,had the for days and one thing am impressed with is audio quality when streaming shows im used to stereo speakers top and bottom of screen but this has been surprise only niggle is if im on bluetooth and get call it reverts back to the phone
Apple,iPhone 13,samsung has longer battery life better camera got samsung note for yrs already and more thats what you may think but trust me the iphone way better battery life than the ultra it has higher battery endurance rating samsung batteries has had problems ever since the note which was even banned from airport flights there was case recently about samsung smartphone batteries swelling up and there was video where guy shot an ultra and iphone and the ultra started smoking up from battery compartment
Apple,iPhone 13,note just ever better than this iphone better screen display more functionality productive you cant compare year old phone to the iphone the iphone has better camera quality and camera features as well and packs in more years of system update and has some of the best chipset on paper it even scores higher benchmark scores than the ultra unlike samsung apple make sure their customers get the latest software and features and also make sure their customers get what their money is worth even if their buyers dont realize it
Apple,iPhone 13,wrong buddy iphone has like hrs longer battery life and there is no way that your note more note just ever better than this iphone better screen display more functionality productive
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone samsung has longer battery life better camera got samsung note for yrs already and its better than iphone but in the other hand choose the phone for what you need it maybe iphone would be better for you if it has something you need that doesnt have
Apple,iPhone 13,samsung its not that good like you think after while you will notice and will wish more kid man dont be fanboy samsung has some better features than iphones way better always on display options encrypted secure folder dex mode better gestures more audio options have both theyre recommended smartphones stop talking from fanboy perspective without any evidence
Apple,iPhone 13,yea sure samsungs feel good for first year and after that it feels so laggy but iphone can more really my samsung is now more than years old and still feels like new in fact it seems to get better as it gets older so please do not make foolish unsubstantiated remarks
Apple,iPhone 13,well if you want phone thats good for all your needs well go for iphone since yknow its fast more samsung its not that good like you think after while you will notice and will wish to go back to iphone only if you are kid and want to install stupid themes and having lag then yeah samsung its better
Apple,iPhone 13,are cameras on this better than fe know it would be better but is there significant differecne
Apple,iPhone 13,the best purchase ive ever made in

Apple,iPhone 13,thanks for your comments and reviews own samsung to me it seems that its better more thats the best part of ios is very easy to use
Apple,iPhone 13,do you even know that even apple havent launched the hz display refresh rate its been dis more the pro iphones have hz refresh rates and the new ones also
Apple,iPhone 13,after updating my iphone to ios felt two issues battery drains very faster more saw similar issues but on iphone pro after the ios update frequently loosing internet on cellular network signal indicator still appears full and sometimes even showing but internet on phone doesnt work at all cant even load web page or send message
Apple,iPhone 13,im from india and im so upset that ios still not available for my iphone checked many more pretty sure you can update and even not from the device just download the ios ipsw file for your device from httpsipswmedownloadiphonea and restore from itunes click shiftrestore and point itunes to the downloaded ipsw file and just wait
Apple,iPhone 13,the best ip
Apple,iPhone 13,really never used high refresh rate screen wonder does it make any difference not ha more there is difference massive one just because chipset is quick doesnt mean it can make phone as smooth as it would be if it had hz screen
Apple,iPhone 13,just few hours to go to update to new ios on th sept excited
Apple,iPhone 13,very sad nowbought my iphone days ago and now this model is year old model cant afford new iphone nowi hope ios make some visible cosmetic changes to iphone to sustain few years in my pocket
Apple,iPhone 13,hz doesnt matter on this phone because its snappy enough that it feels fast anyways really never used high refresh rate screen wonder does it make any difference not having it
Apple,iPhone 13,got an iphone max pro all my calls are blocked called customer service times no resol more go to the settings ang fine the phone and click and and go fine again silent unknown calls just turn it off if ever you turn it on
Apple,iPhone 13,if you keep your phones for that long then the pro is worth it for sure you get brighter more do you even know that even apple havent launched the hz display refresh rate its been discussed under the apple hq and you when started to point out the pros of using hzlmao
Apple,iPhone 13,when the screen off mobile consumes about of the batterywhy
Apple,iPhone 13,so ive been using the iphone xs for over years and im planning to upgrade in more if you keep your phones for that long then the pro is worth it for sure you get brighter screen hz more ram better processor and vastly superior camera the hz is the main thing because once you go youll never wanna go back to
Apple,iPhone 13,ios is good but too strict so thats why im staying android could install any rd party modded apps like youtube with no ads telegramwhatsapp mods etc but with ios is not possiblei guess iphone users are mostly into social stuff tiktok insta etc
Apple,iPhone 13,heating issue with some apps and drain battery have to restart the phone anybody knows why more please get it checked at authorised service center it shouldnt be the case
Apple,iPhone 13,battery vs battery wise my iphone runs more than my iphone but not by larger margin had iphone which gave to wife and bought myself an iphone now very happy but camera wise dont see any improvement in iphone

Apple,iPhone 13,my mobile is new only days use and update ios now network not work no service try samsung
Apple,iPhone 13,is hz enough for some users yes hz is enough but it depends on your usage and expectations some users want top tier experience hz and upwards usb and upwards better cooling solutions higher megapixel sensors larger physical sized sensors faster charging than etc regardless of os there is phone for almost everyones taste
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone ultra wide angle camera lens has auto focus feature no and mini ultra wide dont have autofocus only the pro and pro max have that feature

Apple,iPhone 13,need an advice in replacing my se with iphone or mini for sure go with because the battery will last for day easly and screen size is comfortable for eyes the mini is nice but as backup phone not main one because it is small and light with small screen and sure you have to worry about the battery in mini in case you are even soft gamer or using your phone for long time without charging it for camera both has wonderful camera setup and you will love it anyway good luck with your choice
Apple,iPhone 13,yet redmi note pro cant record with mp camera even say the huawei hon more those things are words the camera might even be better
Apple,iPhone 13,hz isnt needed anyway hz feels very smooth until you experience hz when hz more not everyone is addicted to hz ive used it on my samsungs but never feel bad about going back to hzso some people over ham it when they say they cant go back each to their own but some of are more realistic
Apple,iPhone 13,the can easily last over day depending on usage thanks again for your help
Apple,iPhone 13,thanks mate for your kind advice and what about the battery of iphone does it last for one more the can easily last over day depending on usage
Apple,iPhone 13,just switched from an se to the iphone its definitely worth it thanks mate for your kind advice and what about the battery of iphone does it last for one day
Apple,iPhone 13,hi iphone users please suggest good call recording application for this phone have recen more there is one thing you could do and no its not involving jailbreak but first dont tell anyone you can grab another phone and record an audio file of whatever you say into the phone call and what the other person says via the speaker
Apple,iPhone 13,writing this comment from my iphone this is actually my first iphone have so far used more hz isnt needed anyway hz feels very smooth until you experience hz when hz feels normal and you cant go back to
Apple,iPhone 13,gb is enough if you dont listen to music play games or take much photos even gb is spacious for you
Apple,iPhone 13,mp sizes and video resolution is two different things even you can record in mp camera more yet redmi note pro cant record with mp camera even say the huawei honor from could record
Apple,iPhone 13,im using currently having to pay to use most of the apps is killing me the lack of cal more hi im using iphone which app do you mean
Apple,iPhone 13,hello it completely depends upon your preference of operating systems if you want ios and do more im using currently having to pay to use most of the apps is killing me the lack of call recording is really annoying because always record my calls it helps im really not used to having constraints when using smartphone this is my first time with the ios
Apple,iPhone 13,too overrated dhar mann hasnt heard of android im not saying its bad phone in fact its good but could we have more variety
Apple,iPhone 13,it is nice device
Apple,iPhone 13,yet more than hz is highly overrated on phones and eats battery nice gimmick even gaming more yet most people expect more from their device no matter if its useless or not the year is the standards for aud phone should mean that it at least has hz screen the standards are higher now other than that this phone is pretty good
Apple,iPhone 13,so its possible to record video from mp camera mp sizes and video resolution is two different things even you can record in mp camera if your device and processor support the pre and post video processing
Apple,iPhone 13,poor battery umm yes if you are referring to iphone below series but the newer series are well optimized even the pro max model with just mah can do better rather than most of android phones with mah of battery
Apple,iPhone 13,hhhhh same notch finally they put gb ram they didnt
Apple,iPhone 13,overrated wow why exactly have you tried one out
Apple,iPhone 13,overrated
Apple,iPhone 13,would cringe if the next base model iphone does not have or hz refresh rate yet more than hz is highly overrated on phones and eats battery nice gimmick even gaming consoles for long time didnt use more than hz so ill hardly think its needed in phone which is not primary gaming device for someone who can afford it and for anything else its completely useless
Apple,iPhone 13,basically frame rate on screen higher rate smoother thats right have to suffer from the refresh rate of samsung
Apple,iPhone 13,what does refresh rate means and why it is very important this details basically frame rate on screen higher rate smoother
Apple,iPhone 13,question does this come with just hz screen yes the screen panel is hz but ios is extremely optimised with all the apps which feels lot snappy and buttery smooth in daily tasks you would probably not notice the difference between hz and hz until you compare the displays by keeping the devices side by side
Apple,iPhone 13,no you will not be able to access all features of the watch same not fit in days
Apple,iPhone 13,does my huawei watch gt pro will work good with iphone no you will not be able to access all features of the watch
Apple,iPhone 13,lol if ur teen buy an iphone or prolly gonna get shtted on for having samsung or any type of phone coming from someone whose had personal experience having samsung lmfao
Apple,iPhone 13,dont think wil bothercwith apple iphones again sick of spending hours on camera to take more the iphone camera is one of the most barebones basic camera apps if you cant handle that then dont know what you can handle
Apple,iPhone 13,if you buy for show you will regret it the may update is destroying the phone screen ma more buy an if money is not the issue why not the top from samsung
Apple,iPhone 13,if you want girl friend buy an iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,hello am thinking about buying either iphone gb or samsung galaxy and am no more if you buy for show you will regret it the may update is destroying the phone screen many people who bought are recently busy lamenting recommend you to buy iphone you will not regret it
Apple,iPhone 13,question need to order this one for my new boss at work am an android native since fo more iphones are dual sim but one sim is physical sim card the esim is an electronic kind of virtual sim you would need to contact your network provider to make sure they allow esim
Apple,iPhone 13,why not get clone instead they are aesthetically similar to the latest flagship by apple but their price is way more affordable it is possible to find iphone clones at just of the price of the real handset
Apple,iPhone 13,can someone help me dont know if should buy iphone or samsung ultra dual sim do more hello it completely depends upon your preference of operating systems if you want ios and dont feel to switch then go with iphone and if you are using android and then go with su both are really good in their own spaces but would make bit easier for you with pros and cons of each device iphone pros reliable long term software support best bands best speakers video recording is unbeatable optimisation of apps and system htz screen but feels really snappy because of optimisation cons notch very limited customisation options than android cannot download apps other than app store works great only with apply products but will be pain if you have windows pc or other companies products like smartwatch no proper file manager no call recording need to pay for using almost all apps su pros display is usp best android phone till date lots of customisation options like choosing system wide colour pallets native call recording htz screen feels buttery smooth years of major os upgrade and years of security update selfie and camera pics are really impressive along with night photography builtin pen cons display has random stutters and lags speakers are bit let down compared to su camera performs well in most of the conditions but lacks details in certain shots samsung needs to work on video recording as its no where near to iphones even after spending so much is good but not stronger its pretty heavy and massive phone for people with small hands need to be used by hands sorry for the very long reply but hope this analysis helps you to choose the best device for yourself
Apple,iPhone 13,plan to buy this can anyone from india suggest how is heating issue how is battery more hi man great battery got sot im heavy user great camera one of the best camera on the market no issue problem go with this model one of the best mobile phone ever had
Apple,iPhone 13,very attractive in green colour
Apple,iPhone 13,what do you all recommend between iphone or the better camera and better battery life
Apple,iPhone 13,depends on phone as well my galaxy didnt age in years simply powerful cpu didnt care more ive the se and it realy didnt age so bad but can feel how its beginning to struggle bit and batterylife dont want to talk about the main reason why want an upgrade batterylife got undoubtedly worse
Apple,iPhone 13,not understand why android getting slower day by dayi am using android from starting ne more depends on phone as well my galaxy didnt age in years simply powerful cpu didnt care about newer software apple doesnt have weak cpus unlike android where there are weak and strong phones but most new phones now arent even weak anymore they will age better cpu speed has become non issue
Apple,iPhone 13,if you are tech savvy go android if you are professional go ios dont think most people who bought phone with android are tech savvy lol that or almost everyone is tech savvy nowadays
Apple,iPhone 13,battery of both are the same in time display in better than iphone but in the long term more went on store yesterday and took live demo of bothyes it is the software animations are looking much better on iphone than samsung though it has hz displaybut liked the bigger display moreso decided that this time will be moving for ios to give it try for the first time and as dont have the budget to go for pro max it will be good enough to wait for the iphone max which will be new model from this year with big screen and affordable for meso will wait for the launchthanks to all of for ur replies and suggestions
Apple,iPhone 13,same dilemma get samung same specs par tout
Apple,iPhone 13,the apps use are available in both platforms its only about device best in batter more battery of both are the same in time display in better than iphone but in the long term display of may cause issue like screen inappropriate color comes out camera in better than iphone but ios camera software better than android camera software because ios iphone has cinematic mode you can focus on every character alone
Apple,iPhone 13,first off do you need android apps if yes go android do you need ios apps if yes go ios the apps use are available in both platforms its only about device best in battery display and camera which are my top prioritiesand will be using flagship for the first time so have no idea on this before am using an android midranger now
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone in my own opinion cus ive used them both my will be charged twice befor hitting more thanks for the suggestion
Apple,iPhone 13,which os earlier used if photo stylus lover go with ultra or go with have been using android and never tried ios beforei dont have the budget to get ultrain my region the price of iphone and plus are close with discounts and offers
Apple,iPhone 13,android feels good since samsung is nice since maybe bit earlier but its not great like apple apple is nononsense approach the philosophy of not being in your way and being device to assist you and not dominate your life big difference to the philosophy asian tech heads have which do not support life isnt about tech life is about living and tech is just assistance and nothing more
Apple,iPhone 13,yes too want either or iphonei just want suggestion between these twobcos more iphone in my own opinion cus ive used them both my will be charged twice befor hitting pm in the evening while my ip last me til pm with battery left and doesnt overheat like the galaxy
Apple,iPhone 13,yes sure if you want android device then you can go with samsung but prefer yes too want either or iphonei just want suggestion between these twobcos the price of both are close in my region with offersand it is snapdragon version of spreference wise camera display and battery backup
Apple,iPhone 13,in my region series has snapdragon versionso will be good option really
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone pro models are best for few exclusive camera features and hertz smooth scroll displ more you forgot to mention that iphone pro and pro max have one gpu core more than iphone or iphone mini so that makes it better for gaming
Apple,iPhone 13,after times buying samsung switched to apple and for first time didnt wanna have more in my region series has snapdragon versionso will be good option
Apple,iPhone 13,which will be good option to buy iphone or samsung sin my region im getting more after times buying samsung switched to apple and for first time didnt wanna have suboptimal cpu that heats up too much various disappointing things read including subpar performance compared to other android devices apple simply has best cpu right now the camera is excellent as well though they have both good cameras the biggest selling point is maybe the software that is way better with apple for me at least if at all would only buy the version with snapdragon cpu which wasnt option where live
Apple,iPhone 13,my iphone takes good photos when taking shots but after captured and while reviewing photos in photos app iphone change exposure or sharpness kind of making auto adjustmentssome times making photos weird and ugly how do stop this
Apple,iPhone 13,do not use camera lense protector best thing to use is the ringke camera styling im using more really
Apple,iPhone 13,my iphone is month old and has its camera lens paint chipping in spots use the phon more do not use camera lense protector best thing to use is the ringke camera styling im using it and it works flawlesly it does not cover the camera lense hence it doesnt reduce the camera quality even at night with flash that is your ultimate solution
Apple,iPhone 13,its solved in thanks to apple seems to have heard the battery issue and resolved it now the battery last for more than hrs
Apple,iPhone 13,those who bought iphone indian variant kindly drop your reviews battery life camer more camera and build quality is best and stunning performance
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone on upgradation to ios battery is not lasting for more than day any sol more its solved in
Apple,iPhone 13,is it only me or the camera quality of iphone is really bad it is somewhat grainy and ki more make sure you bought an original product because camera is one of the strongest features on ip family
Apple,iPhone 13,really you know theres nice review on this site
Apple,iPhone 13,apple and other phones use machine learning or often called ai to improve image quality its more really
Apple,iPhone 13,any solution not to lose whatsapp chats when switching from android to iphone any trans paid version works like magic
Apple,iPhone 13,cynicnymous apr ai artificial intelligence what can this help me in this dialogue apple and other phones use machine learning or often called ai to improve image quality its basically always used nowadays when you use the camera big part of apple cpu is just for machine learning
Apple,iPhone 13,interesting this means your camera usage uses the cpuai core lot maybe buy one of those more ai artificial intelligence what can this help me in this dialogue
Apple,iPhone 13,while using camera app for only clicking indoor photos just for minutes on my iphone it more interesting this means your camera usage uses the cpuai core lot maybe buy one of those phone coolers dont put it in normal case that would make it worse
Apple,iPhone 13,that kind of battery never seen on an iphone before amazing really
Apple,iPhone 13,depends how you use it my iphone never gets hot when use those things im very surprise more maybe it depends on the climate that the phone gets heat up or nt
Apple,iPhone 13,httpswwwgsmarenacompostopinionphp whats up jijiiii
Apple,iPhone 13,httpswwwgsmarenacompostopinionphp
Apple,iPhone 13,your question was no sense so the answer will be no sense didnt ask any question that was someone elsei was just trying to understand what you said to the other person
Apple,iPhone 13,you made no sense in that reply your question was no sense so the answer will be no sense
Apple,iPhone 13,bro there is quotation in arabic that says the sagesse is hidden under tiny grain it more you made no sense in that reply
Apple,iPhone 13,seriously bro there is quotation in arabic that says the sagesse is hidden under tiny grain it is not that am only android fan boy but respect companies that make premium devices remember how much suffered in galaxy note for example even though my previous galaxy had super camera and nice seamless navigation but in other way iphone in the era of galaxy note was better in android it is super customization and secure folder with freedom of work but iphone is serious likewise do your task and forget the buds of iphone is better because it is connected to device which is serious but android headphone jack sometimes you get voice and sometimes ppl talking to will tell you remove the earphones and lets talk normal also if you open the speaker ppl who you are talking to will tell you close the speaker and speak attached to ears am tired want to get iphone normal and ssd with encrption like will be nice
Apple,iPhone 13,am planning to buy iphone because of its ear buds seriously
Apple,iPhone 13,bigger sensor doesnt determine photo quality or minimum focus distance actually it does bigger sensor means more light captured what youre referring to is post processing which is done after photo has been taken so you might not like post processing itself but photo itself is better thats why flagship phones seems to do better photos than dslr but if you edit dslr taken photo it will be better one since dslr barely has any post processing
Apple,iPhone 13,if the pro is not pro max and you dont need the telephoto lens then the is pro more any solution not to lose whatsapp chats when switching from android to iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,have questions am an android user and am planing to use iphone first question is more try smart switch to transfer files across
Apple,iPhone 13,great device upgraded from the iphone great battery life and nothing to complain about have used android devices like samsungs xiaomis but no phone is like the iphone dont care about refresh rates of the display as this consumes more battery hz on iphones is not like the hz on my xiaomi mi for example ios is much better in terms of optimization had lot of issues with miui fortunately im not using the xiaomi anymore id say go for the iphone if you want at least years of ios support
Apple,iPhone 13,absolute shit ive bought it days ago to replace my iphone what found is battery performance is shit and the display performance always went down whenever tried to check the updates im not done yet we dont talk about the camera can say my iphone could even take more good picture than the iphone itself
Apple,iPhone 13,bigger sensor bigger sensor doesnt determine photo quality or minimum focus distance
Apple,iPhone 13,my iphone plus finally gave up bought iphone model for replacement to my surprise th more bigger sensor
Apple,iPhone 13,am highly annoyed to think of de fact dat some phones below here can have battery life more it doesnt depend on the battery size there are many important aspects that define battery life such as cpu efficiency optimization etc you could see on battery tests how the iphone pro max got the best battery life on phone even compared to phone with mah battery
Apple,iPhone 13,the screen scratches really easily for an unbreakable glass who said it was unbreakable
Apple,iPhone 13,more pixels dont means better cameras there is poco for example mpx camera really sucks more dont think you understand zooming after you take photo or blowing up image to size from digital photo the more pixels you have on the camera the less the photo will degrade when you zoom into picture you have already taken mpxl is not enough if you want to print an copy or zoom into the photo on your phone you really need mpxl to get little photo degradation when zooming in on already taken photo
Apple,iPhone 13,prefer the design of the vanilla iphone over the pros but this really needed high refre more trust me when say the hz is subtle improvement you have to be looking for the difference to notice it had with hz screen only time noticed it was scrolling instagram and concentrating on the screen to notice there was no difference browsing web pages than hz screen
Apple,iPhone 13,hows the battery draining with this one considering having done the latest updates since it more iphone pro models are best for few exclusive camera features and hertz smooth scroll display except these points all series iphones have almost same performance but if your primary concern is battery then iphone pro max will be the best option as none of the smartphone in market androids or other iphones is able to beat it in this department
Apple,iPhone 13,had any else noticed slight crushing of the shadows blacks only noticed it when transferring few images via shared folder between my iphone and pci will have to try and rule out my pc screen but am guessing it might be the lack of hdr on my pc monitor and the full time hdr on the iphone or am being stupid
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone is not for all people that knows apple brand is aware about battery and dont care ma more with my usage my iphone standard version lasts from charge up to for days my moto charged to as its my iphone camera backup battery bank and general work phone lasts easily days people should research before buyingi knew my usage patterns and knew what devices meet my requirements saying apple users dont care is bit offsome of us do care but also some of us dont stick to living in eco system of one brand
Apple,iPhone 13,will android user adapt ok nothing like in android so want to try transferred over from android after using them for pretty much my whole life didnt struggle at all really just spend day transferring all my stuff over and setting it up how like your mileage may vary but at the end of the day smartphone is smartphone most apps features are available on both
Apple,iPhone 13,was going to purchase memory stick or dongle in order to drag photos from my iphone without using computer but decided to link my iphone directly to my android moto using the bundled type to lightning cable admittedly you cant do much but what it does do is allows to access to my photo folder on my iphone via my moto screen the required screen pops up automatically cant seem to find it manually but anyway once you link the phones tap trust this device on the iphone screen you enter the dcim or whatever folder its called via the android swipe down to refresh the page and then your iphone photo folder is accessible where you can long press and select images to either copy or move from the iphone to the android device the android can also charge the iphone so my little moto is now my portable photo storage and back up charger
Apple,iPhone 13,think the is better overall because it has newer soc better battery life better main more what forgot to add is that the pro has lidar and gb of ram so multitasking and stuff like measurements with the camera will be better the on the other hand has cinematic mode seems like gimmick to me but havent tested it and photographic styles which are useful because think the current processing makes daylight shots bit too bright and saturated so maybe it can be set to not make that
Apple,iPhone 13,found almost new and pro almost new at the same price which is better if both same cost think the is better overall because it has newer soc better battery life better main camera and will get more software support but if you prefer the design of the pro with the matte glass back and stainless steel frame as well as the telephoto camera you should get that one
Apple,iPhone 13,it annoys me when someone called me on imo then volume after calls got stock into low sounds if you play videosmusic no other way but to shut down back then to normal any concern please uninstalled imo to get rid of it
Apple,iPhone 13,upgraded from to this days back battery aint impressive rest is the best stuff always make sure disable news apps and limit personal assistant integration with other appsi hate how both android phones and iphones always come with almost everything enabled out of the box on initial start up the siri integration with individual apps can be independently enabled or disabledi cant stand siri so it gets everything disabled then there is the email sync options whether to set them to push pull manual is up tp you but have always set all my phones to manual sync to save any battery life can as well as being able to not be annoyed bothered by emails pinging away while get on with other stuff
Apple,iPhone 13,hi love the iphone pro max apple but im not going to upgrade every year just for an update
Apple,iPhone 13,liion batteries already is past so powerful phone with so cheap battery thats why li ion batteries degrading so fast hope they start to use lipo batteries
Apple,iPhone 13,not major difference bw iphone and would rather say go with iphone if theres good deal
Apple,iPhone 13,which phone better this or iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 13,you are right but if people have iphones they prefer using imessage because of the variety more not totally truei have never used imessage with my friends who also use iphonenot one of us is bothered with it its either whatsapp or fb messenger or standard sms
Apple,iPhone 13,who do fanboys let themselves be robbed by crapple for the ishite would be nice if you wrote in english
Apple,iPhone 13,lets start with the obvious the only people having this conversation about imessage are amer more you are right but if people have iphones they prefer using imessage because of the variety of things they can exchange through it
Apple,iPhone 13,if you dont want very heavy phone or think stainless steel is slippery dont get more and sometimes black but also grey is good choice
Apple,iPhone 13,here can see bunch of hater android user haha
Apple,iPhone 13,yes totally and ive never experienced using pro or pro max version of an iphone if you dont want very heavy phone or think stainless steel is slippery dont get pro iphone and if you want my personal opinion think starlight white is the best colour followed by blue but you might prefer pink
Apple,iPhone 13,thanks for responding to my query really appreciate my pleasure
Apple,iPhone 13,are you torn apart between the phones because of their colours can tell you pro max has more yes totally and ive never experienced using pro or pro max version of an iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,the is my very first iphone have always bought cheaper android phones but decided to mov more in your opinion the iphone looks nicer than the ok buddy and nice thought you were so trapped in the ecosystem that you needed apple maps
Apple,iPhone 13,help needed hi guys currently own an iphone and due for contract renewal with my more are you torn apart between the phones because of their colours can tell you pro max has better battery life and telephoto but it is heavyweight phone and half as gsmarenas says other than that pro and pro max have stainless steel frame which while being durable is slippery to hold without case and maybe marginally better gpu performance
Apple,iPhone 13,pro if you want something thats compact has great battery life and hz pro max if more thanks for responding to my query really appreciate
Apple,iPhone 13,with chrome profiles you can separate all of your chrome stuff create profiles for friends and family or split between work and fun
Apple,iPhone 13,think every phone should have form factor like this yeah true
Apple,iPhone 13,the phone is all the same design from the iphone to no difference but still ok but prefer
Apple,iPhone 13,hi guys does anyone has experience unusual issue while you are playing youtube or spotify the more this was happened because of face detection in iphones dont worry this is great feature of iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,is this politics love apple products and thats it you clearly dont so why you are here more the post made wasnt to hate on apple personally have no grievances against them think they make good quality devices replying to your original comment the problem is that you love apple even though as you stated they dont innovate this seems to me bit of company bias even if you love them if apple doesnt innovate you should at least have some criticism for their lack of finding something new you should say yes apple products are great but their innovation is not great which is not great for the long term
Apple,iPhone 13,thats the excuse you have to apple not innovating often bet if samsung or xiaomi didn more is this politics love apple products and thats it you clearly dont so why you are here in first place why
Apple,iPhone 13,why do all iphones starting with have set of holes at the bottom of the phone know the more the other holes are for the microphone
Apple,iPhone 13,getting it next week
Apple,iPhone 13,apple is not chinese company to believe on being an unlucky number bro are you ignorant unlucky number is western thing based on christian origins the chinese know nothing about it theyd treat as just another number of course the western world is largely secular now so no one really cares about it anymore
Apple,iPhone 13,tbh im bit surprised that apple didnt skip and go for iphone instead even more apple is not chinese company to believe on being an unlucky number
Apple,iPhone 13,yea but despite all the issues that note users have was because of the lack of snapdragon va more what type of issues talking aboutim using note for more than years exynos came with android till now upgraded to android and android still working fine and will be getting android by next monthits running as smooth as have been using since day onethe only thing have to change maybe battery which can still be used for months and it is common that it will be nearly years old
Apple,iPhone 13,use galaxy note ultra year and im very satisfied with my lovely phone battery is good more yea but despite all the issues that note users have was because of the lack of snapdragon variants that were sold if they dont sort out the issue with exynos next year unless they sort out the issue with the fe then its really deal breaker for me
Apple,iPhone 13,ultra is great but its behind the launch date so why wait till the series will more glass back yuck plastic or like this better always break
Apple,iPhone 13,if you never used to samsung phones then go with the iphone pro max cuz think it has more use galaxy note ultra year and im very satisfied with my lovely phone battery is good camera is excellent performance excellent all the phone work perfectly and wouldnt change it for any phone else
Apple,iPhone 13,stuck in loop of type in apple id and passcode create new apple id passcode wont accept my email invalid this is email use all the time currently open useable disgusting
Apple,iPhone 13,macro required third lens hardware not by software impossible macro requires an ultrawide which the iphone has its just that its ultrawide is not as good as that of the iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 13,hey there everyone im not old to this app but this is my first time posting comment more note ultra will be best bcos comparing note ultra with pro max is ok but have mentioned iphone so note ultra is all round better than iphone in every aspectcamera display etc everythingbeside will have the support of spen too
Apple,iPhone 13,plz advice which colour of iphn should buy pink blue white red starlight would be flashy pink will be girlish black will be traditional blue would be different finally colour is personal preference
Apple,iPhone 13,blue would more attractive agree blue isnt too flashy
Apple,iPhone 13,will the iphone also can get macro feature by next update macro required third lens hardware not by software impossible
Apple,iPhone 13,no because it doesnt have the proper hardware for it actually according to reports on ios the toggle of tulip flower will be just in the native camera app on the pro series
Apple,iPhone 13,so sus beacuse iphone needs an upgrade man like cams bruh thought the iphone will more ultra is great but its behind the launch date so why wait till the series will launch next year when the pro max and the ultra are both good enough and think its safe to say you wont be disappointed at all
Apple,iPhone 13,no reallyasus rog phone black sharkred magiceven ultra its better all of them are better but the pro max is still capable and far from causing issues because apple optimizes their current iphones to make them not run slow even on demanding games it will still run perfectly fine
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post trash yet some are buying it and didnt face any problems with it
Apple,iPhone 13,the notch is too tall why have they changed it if knew this would just have got the
Apple,iPhone 13,thats because apple is so far ahead of lagdroid at this point every cpu update is dimi more no reallyasus rog phone black sharkred magiceven ultra its better
Apple,iPhone 13,well well apple seem to be getting cheeky because the iphone marks shift for apple not ma more thats because apple is so far ahead of lagdroid at this point every cpu update is diminishing return
Apple,iPhone 13,sad reality that google will never have good message app rcs failed apple wont budge apple will win there
Apple,iPhone 13,no in other words we can afford one or even if we wanted we are just smart about spendi more oh you are so very smart especially because you said so
Apple,iPhone 13,mohd rabbani nov when receive always on screen how long wait iphone probably maybe
Apple,iPhone 13,when receive always on screen how long wait
Apple,iPhone 13,in other words you cant afford one no in other words we can afford one or even if we wanted we are just smart about spending our money
Apple,iPhone 13,your beloved iphones are built by foxconn in china iphones are million times better but sti more can you elaborate on what youre trying to say
Apple,iPhone 13,still got that big ass notch and charging in finally someone noticed that
Apple,iPhone 13,you should definitely go for it unless the lack of an sd card slot is deal breaker iphone more your beloved iphones are built by foxconn in china iphones are million times better but still no usb superspeed but lightning which has the same speed transfer of mbps like my old redmi note and supervooc watts flash charge iphones are too overhyped and too overrated for my taste ok iphone fanboy
Apple,iPhone 13,if you can make it at inch screen size with max mm width thickness is ok at then of course you do not need mini otherwise its too big for smaller hands pockets etc then of course it makes sense to make max model but with and mm width is not covering lot of people
Apple,iPhone 13,love thes phone but no funds to purchase the battery capacity and the functions of the phone are goodthe is the best
Apple,iPhone 13,beyond gb ram is overkill and wasting resources this is make sense series think
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post yawn you do realize that apple is doing the right things not just making the wrong things theyve done great job but you know nothing about tech so just think you need to relax and have cup of tea
Apple,iPhone 13,deleted post sounds like you need to do research before coming back
Apple,iPhone 13,and that low res camera could still take better photos than phones with literally the res more you can install the render software
Apple,iPhone 13,omg you are buying phone to use do you want every year innovative devices lmao iphones more thats the excuse you have to apple not innovating often bet if samsung or xiaomi didnt innovate every year you would call their phones boring dont try to hide it apple as marques said recycling their phone designs signals lack of incentive for me ill tell you whats good about having new devices every year that means you have even more choice as to if you want to get an old flagship or new midranger say you want to get an with horizontal camera array or oneplus pro with pop up camera or maybe redmi note pro with hz or oppo find with fast charging dont worry were not rich either we dont buy phones every year but that doesnt mean we dont appreciate innovation if companies barely innovated every year then lg rip wouldnt have made multitouch phone until or quad core until
Apple,iPhone 13,like more iphone or iphone xs design
Apple,iPhone 13,any option is there to increase notification sounds
Apple,iPhone 13,why would the image be worser it looks absolutely excellent when the photi processing is imme more they did such great job that they cudnt even add the pause feature which is been default feature in droid for yearsfor all missing features fanboys depend on rd party apps and call ios bestlolall hail applegreat job
Apple,iPhone 13,can someone tell me right app for pausing video on iphone during recording because dont wan more why would the image be worser it looks absolutely excellent when the photi processing is immediate theyve done great job
Apple,iPhone 13,why would anyone buy this its the same as the iphone nothing changed except the price lol
Apple,iPhone 13,im thinking of going from android had enough of the apps and messing about just want phon more go for the pro max it has some good benefits to consider
Apple,iPhone 13,paid for this gb variant in my countryindia was initially very happy then more ermmm does his cheap chinese phone have imessage no does it have quality apps no does it have yrs updates no get what pay for end of
Apple,iPhone 13,how do you know that they havent even run benchmarks yet well check out the benchmarks for yourself httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparegoogletensorvsappleabionic
Apple,iPhone 13,ram is just for storing apps it does little to impact the overall speed of phone and its res more so on iphone apps are held for longer than on android
Apple,iPhone 13,wowww and google were hyping us up that they were trying to be like apple trying more how do you know that they havent even run benchmarks yet
Apple,iPhone 13,bro stop telling liesa gb ram device cant be faster than an gb ram device ram is just for storing apps it does little to impact the overall speed of phone and its responsiveness have had hz and hz android phones with and gb of ram and finally tried an iphone on hzgb and the way the apps are optimized is on another level the experience itself is flawless for me on ios what more can ask for cheaper price sure but that isnt going to happen
Apple,iPhone 13,wanted to correct thing which is pixel ll hopefully get years worth of security update more wowww and google were hyping us up that they were trying to be like apple trying keyword feels like lot of missed potential tensor being not even close to as performance and now not many software updates fingers crossed the cameras are still good
Apple,iPhone 13,dont worry the situation will get better at least with pixels from now on after pixe more wanted to correct thing which is pixel ll hopefully get years worth of security updates not major software updates everything else you said is true tho
Apple,iPhone 13,thank you very much for all the suggestions must admit even wanted to get some of these more dont worry the situation will get better at least with pixels from now on after pixel every pixel will get years of software updates and if you can do consider getting the pixel as it is lot cheaper than iphone whilst having better display camera and well see battery only thing is pixel has worse performance but not by much since zenfone oneplus xiaomi and are made in they should last years but if you need really long term like years then only google will do was recently having an argument with someone as to why nokia was bad deal in my eyes it just doesnt have much features but the other guy stated that what it does have like motorola edge is long software support so do check them out
Apple,iPhone 13,hello everyone its time for me to buy new phone and im torn between iphone more if you can hold the iphone and its not too big for you would recommend it over the mini as the battery tradeoff is lot better also check out the pro if you can get it at cheap deal if you are deciding between iphone and iphone get the as it has smaller notch better speakers better performance and battery life actually how important is battery life to you cuz there are bunch of great compact phones like pixel zenfone and and they are great for everything except battery thing is if you dont play games you could save some money and get the pixel or even pixels offer great realiable cameras pixels do also have clean software if you are into that you could even get the sony xperia ii if you dont mind the tall display or the buttons on the right side or iii lite again cheaper
Apple,iPhone 13,oct ram allows you to run more apps simultaneously which is moot point for iphone which has limi more wish it was like that but dude commented on nord video said that their gb ram iphone xr could hold apps better than their gb nord sad but it is what it is the way iphone works is that unlike android which has dedicated app to hold apps in the backgroud the apps just get stored in the background hence leaving more space what google should do in order to fully optimise their pixel series for best ram is to just ditch android as it is now leave all the other companies with crappy ram android and develop new ui system this time without the app to manage other apps and since they are already following apples footsteps with new chip designed for pixel and years of software support they can fully embrace apple lifestyle by actually optimising their apps
Apple,iPhone 13,upgrading to iphone from the xr and im looking forward to it do admit that im disappointed that only the pro models were given hz refresh but guess they needed something to entice people to buy the more expensive models but the reality is working from home all the time means have little need for high refresh display or telephoto and macro photo capabilities which is why picked up the regular degular over the pro also kind of sucks that they kept the lighting cable for the iphones but gave it to their ipads oh well cant win everything
Apple,iPhone 13,something needs to be said here android phones are not slow this is not the uis are more you said it bro
Apple,iPhone 13,no hz freaking greedy apples imagine if apple didnt put hz on the they couldve added it to the and mini with ltpo display
Apple,iPhone 13,unfortunately it doesnt come with dual sim in the us but the china version has dual si more that video was about the iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,does this phone have proper dual sim support or second sim is esim in india unfortunately it doesnt come with dual sim in the us but the china version has dual sim if you dont know what dual sim is check out of his video from hugh jeffreys indicating that the us component comes with single sim while the component from china has dual sim
Apple,iPhone 13,the overall speed of deice is not necessarily directly related to the amount of ram ios is more ram allows you to run more apps simultaneously which is moot point for iphone which has limited multitasking can be hardly called smartphone
Apple,iPhone 13,ios doesnt required as much ram as does android this gb phone as you call it is way fa more bro stop telling liesa gb ram device cant be faster than an gb ram device
Apple,iPhone 13,less than is crime on high end smartphones
Apple,iPhone 13,dont worry in months hugh jeffrey will show you how to repair it like always hugh jeffreys or phone repair guru
Apple,iPhone 13,false no its true
Apple,iPhone 13,just released already outdated its not that outdated apps do open faster as well as gaming they still run as quick as they were and dont think youll ever run into any problems with performance and battery life
Apple,iPhone 13,but with that price they should pack more ram even they dont need it then theres really no point of adding more ram when it doesnt even need it gb ram is more than enough for iphones
Apple,iPhone 13,lol who would pay so much for gb ram phone ios doesnt required as much ram as does android this gb phone as you call it is way faster compared to other gb android phones out therecheck you facts
Apple,iPhone 13,how about lens flare still exist whats that
Apple,iPhone 13,minor upgrades kaizen technique
Apple,iPhone 13,how bout step out of apples hypnotic fanboy zone take criticism with pinch of salti kn more could you please elaborate on what you say about the
Apple,iPhone 13,suggest everyone considering this to watch hugh jeffreys latest video it doesnt get more antirepair than this
Apple,iPhone 13,apple iphone is status symbol and nothing else status symbol for those dumb cts who believe paying nomal price for device with less specsfeatures discrepancies is status symbollol
Apple,iPhone 13,how about you write in coherent sentences before you start to criticize the development decisi more how bout step out of apples hypnotic fanboy zone take criticism with pinch of salti know that burns ur sorry ego scarred with delusion
Apple,iPhone 13,why do people focus on specs for iphones when they consistently outperform android devices wit more similar not betterlol urself said ithear it wake up also dude is disgusted by redundant lacklusture camera lens design presence of medieval notch which arent specslol watevr ppl complain boutu fanboys gotta protect glorify ur crapple
Apple,iPhone 13,why why why mah having notch no design look for the camera why apple why why more bruh you dont even have clue what youre saying the iphone has been big step to battery life which lasts through the day with single charge even on daily basis you dont even have to worry about it plus the notch is smaller this year so who cares if they are bothered by it and what about the camera design they are now diagonal rather than just vertical so dont care what anyone thinks about it they are full of trash talkers and they need to be banned from the internet for good especially you wannabe or josh but who cares its just my opinion so dont take this too seriously
Apple,iPhone 13,these crazy apple people should have gone for hz display for nonpro versions the difference between hz and hz is so negligible that the pro would lose its usp
Apple,iPhone 13,wish own an iphone but their prices are too expensive thank god for android with few ce more apple iphone is status symbol and nothing else
Apple,iPhone 13,the camera design kinda reminds me of google pixel like
Apple,iPhone 13,android made android is an os and they make none of what youve mentioned apple on the more maybe hes bit confused and not understand about osoperating system and phone manufacture that used android osandroid is phone os not phone company that made phone
Apple,iPhone 13,android has made many innovations such as folding screens samsung fold flip series ro more android made android is an os and they make none of what youve mentioned apple on the other hand has great hardware and software integration where they control every step android on the other hand can be put onto samsung xiaomi sony oppo oneplus etc and work way different on every single phone as for innovation some things are cool some not at the end of the day it all comes down to what the customer wants and how happy he is with the product
Apple,iPhone 13,am mistaken or is it just an upgraded iphoneif it is thats ok and smart business model if you have all those unsold iphones and need to move em
Apple,iPhone 13,kinda like this and the mini im on lg midrange and am big fan of android but am open to apple love their macbook and ipad air got them in rose gold stuff that pink and some of the new features in ios is really enticing makes me want to buy it when there is great sale as well as some sony buds ive been wanting still no type though which is disappointing
Apple,iPhone 13,guys can you help me decide im so much confused about which one to buy either iphone more according to me iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13,have the same problem personally think it all depends on what phone size and color you pref more thanks for advice but still no clear answer same here want pro features including battery and screen size thats some what manageable
Apple,iPhone 13,no gb on iphone is equivalent to gb on android really
Apple,iPhone 13,that new camera layout looks like alien eyeswith mic as its small open mouth lol hahahahaha exactly
Apple,iPhone 13,camera looks umm
Apple,iPhone 13,samsung ss front and back is made out of gorilla glass victus it literally isnt its made of plastic please do your research
Apple,iPhone 13,rumours have it that this phone is coming with no charging port heard it wont come with screen either
Apple,iPhone 13,finally phone can upgrade to from the se
Apple,iPhone 13,this phone isnt even usd and if you look at the specs its not made of plastic in fact more samsung ss front and back is made out of gorilla glass victus
Apple,iPhone 13,really dont understand people who are throwing money away over usd for this for more this phone isnt even usd and if you look at the specs its not made of plastic in fact its made of metal and glass unlike some android phones today cough cough samsung
Apple,iPhone 13,wow man you are damn right its an alien phone the camera layout looks like fidget spinner lol
Apple,iPhone 13,gb on an iphone is equivalent to about gb on an android dude the difference is at most gb
Apple,iPhone 13,only bit upgrade camera still same design still no video recording price ridicioulus insane
Apple,iPhone 13,nah gb on iphone equivalent to about gb on android you think apple can make inferior hardwa more lol just look at the mp iphone pro max it could literally beat the ultra which literally has the megapixels
Apple,iPhone 13,hi do you guys think that switching from galaxy note to the iphone would be good ch more dont know what happened to ur note batteryim using note from years still now get hours of sot running on android version even play pubg for an hour everyday and other usage being youtube fb insta and few phone callsif wish to try out ios then can try out iphone but if want to be in android can wait for fe which will be announced soon or can go for or its plus version
Apple,iPhone 13,fanboy such childish response over mobile phone lol actually dont own an ipho more then you clearly dont much about os or let alone hardware if in your mind gb equals gb big lol by making this claim you dont even know what ram is or let alone how it works
Apple,iPhone 13,indian veriant price much higher than other countriesnot justify apple should manufa more you do realise apple have been trying to make the assembly local but its only cause of the unnecessary surplus taxesminus the taxes which are anyways levied in general gst and whatnot levied by the indian government they arent yet assembling iphones in india and before you start of with govt levies taxes which are necessary blah blah imagine you getting your monthly salary and on top of the taxes that are already getting deducted say theres extra deduction for some bullshit reason would you be just fine letting that money from your paycheck go for flimsy reasons
Apple,iPhone 13,they should had named this the iphone the iphone will have more significant changes than either of the two previous ones
Apple,iPhone 13,the iphone is considerably wider than both the iphone and check the specs yes understand the bezels are smaller on the but still think thats countered by the flat sides really
Apple,iPhone 13,my ipod is gb ram and work everything perfectly now gb is far enough for this phone
Apple,iPhone 13,well in theory even centre hole is kind of old in tech time frame yeah maybe
Apple,iPhone 13,is this juz me feelin this camera setup weird
Apple,iPhone 13,no it isnt lol but what can expect from blind fanboy fanboy such childish response over mobile phone lol actually dont own an iphone havent done so for about years im speaking equivalents when it comes to the os try not to get too upset again
Apple,iPhone 13,havent owned an iphone for years now really do like the iphone but apart from the hz refresh rate dont see anything innovative to sway me away from android if ios loosened up even more to allow further customisation would definitely consider this
Apple,iPhone 13,wow gb ram againbye iphone gb on an iphone is equivalent to about gb on an android
Apple,iPhone 13,wtf still no center hole camera old design well in theory even centre hole is kind of old in tech time frame
Apple,iPhone 13,if expensives phone not come with mm jack it may worsen the industry or may another business booming of wireless handsfree
Apple,iPhone 13,why no usbc
Apple,iPhone 13,im not an iphone user but this phone is the perfect size android manufacturers really more you do know there are other android phones out there that have similar if not nearly the same dimensions as this phone right
Apple,iPhone 13,think its more of an opinion thing ive held an iphone and they feel way too more the iphone is considerably wider than both the iphone and check the specs
Apple,iPhone 13,price impractical
Apple,iPhone 13,still no high refresh rate should be default for phone lol
Apple,iPhone 13,usb with proprietary connector thats incompatible with of other electronic devices in wooow the future is here guys
Apple,iPhone 13,im so surprised its so cheaper why its not for million rupees we mevoooo
Apple,iPhone 13,how can buy this phone from bangladesh you can always buy iphones from district sadr customer care centers of grameenphone robi and banglalink but iphone lineup will be launched after november in bangladesh
Apple,iPhone 13,its support lund believe yes maybe even have ability to send it on dms make sure to not sync up with icloud
Apple,iPhone 13,its literally the same phone as the but with more storage and battery life not surprised to be honest
Apple,iPhone 13,same old same old
Apple,iPhone 13,hope these apple guys have improved battery life of these phones at least something like more pro max has milli amps battery capacity thus hours more battery life than pro max
Apple,iPhone 13,does this support lhdc or ldac its support lund
Apple,iPhone 13,waiting another year for another camera customization lol
Apple,iPhone 13,just wait with gpu nvidia hhihi
Apple,iPhone 13,just different without any innovation
Apple,iPhone 13,gram
Apple,iPhone 13,why the specs doesnt involve the battery capacity because apple dont like revealing specific number they rather prefer using magic words like all day battery life to make the people who buy them feel happy about preordering it
Apple,iPhone 13,when is the notch going away probably on the iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,why the specification dont show battery size guess mah based on iphone at mah
Apple,iPhone 13,cant believe it they did it again the joke of the year same big and ugly notch for series in row same hz small battery same mp camera and still no fingerprinthow they still have sales at that price dont get it people
Apple,iPhone 13,yeah but iphone users just care about the real life usage right so those specs differences wo more why the specs doesnt involve the battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone does only little with their new models not worth the upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13,its important played always in hz monitor and have hz phone its noticeable once you more how can buy this phone from bangladesh
Apple,iPhone 13,you get much better sensor much better chip and better battery yeah but iphone users just care about the real life usage right so those specs differences wont matter
Apple,iPhone 13,most guys crying about iphone not having over hz display without even knowing what more its important played always in hz monitor and have hz phone its noticeable once your eyes are consistent with it
Apple,iPhone 13,apple is disappointment euros for this phone take look at the features hz refresh more no ultrawide camera youre blind
Apple,iPhone 13,think your xr is still good for another year basically the only thing you get is oled and more you get much better sensor much better chip and better battery
Apple,iPhone 13,apple took almost year to relaunch apple with new name and gb ram great your xiaomi also does the same thing lol
Apple,iPhone 13,low resolution rear cameras mp for the past years mp is enough for and th more no ultrawide and those quad bayer mp cameras you see around deliver megapixels please dont post cheap rants did you even read the specs
Apple,iPhone 13,perfect size and perfect weight
Apple,iPhone 13,sure gb ram
Apple,iPhone 13,why nokia brand no progress
Apple,iPhone 13,this is apple being lazy
Apple,iPhone 13,if you have an iphone or above dont waste your money getting the iphone just wait till next year for the iphone theres really nothing special about this one
Apple,iPhone 13,to me dont see anything too speacial about the device series came out good last year the different between and is just not it note am an apple lover the truth is needed to be said aside the ios updates security and camera quality nothing more to apple and all is just too expensive for quite little features icloud backups gb and cant even zoom for caliber of apple device
Apple,iPhone 13,apply iphone with gb of ram hahaha took them almost year for this very big upgrade ha more iphones dont need higher ram and this is proved gb is quite alot for ios
Apple,iPhone 13,like itnewbee
Apple,iPhone 13,next year with the iphone youre optimistic
Apple,iPhone 13,it is not worth it if you already have an iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,apple still pushing for no higher refresh rate for base series lmao
Apple,iPhone 13,that camera design is ugly
Apple,iPhone 13,better iphone but no as unlucky
Apple,iPhone 13,no clue what the difference still gonna buy it
Apple,iPhone 13,like this phone its great
Apple,iPhone 13,no hz lollllll what joke agree
Apple,iPhone 13,why do apple make fun of people by releasing the copy of every phone with very high price
Apple,iPhone 13,innovation in apple is over now my one plus seems to have better features than iphone they are following footsteps of blackberryhope fate is not the same
Apple,iPhone 13,same iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,ll just stick to my old phone nothing special about this iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,its yet apple is still using lightning port and no high refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone is worst in battery dont dare to buy have iphone pro gives me headache for eating lots of battery have to charge times day very worst this iphone is nothing but the same in terms of battery thats sure so better think trice than sorry also iphone is still selling higher price yet the looks of it has no change at all very dull very ugly yes am not happy iphone user here
Apple,iPhone 13,this is really shame for apple that it is normal iphone have no hz they could choose higher price for that screen but they did not so this is big dissapointment
Apple,iPhone 13,what about battery mah they are shame of revealing it
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone destroying just because of battery because when buy iphone they said half life of iphone during charging we spent it and half life of iphone we satisfying to others saying that iphone is iphon thats just because of self satisfying fking because of battery
Apple,iPhone 13,is it really ram thats quite bigger than last gen
Apple,iPhone 13,is the ram confirmed believe it is as the just released it in the event today
Apple,iPhone 13,battery mah main thisng is hidden
Apple,iPhone 13,ugly camera module
Apple,iPhone 13,nice one im thinking finally upgrade my xr think your xr is still good for another year basically the only thing you get is oled and the ultra wide
Apple,iPhone 13,they they shouldve given their favorite mp sensor for ultrawide think apple has loads and loads of that sensors
Apple,iPhone 13,all are same they only changed name
Apple,iPhone 13,and hum drum again you are not listening apple
Apple,iPhone 13,for hz
Apple,iPhone 13,nice design
Apple,iPhone 13,its near the end of and still no hz while apple is only giving it to pro models so they have an actual feature that makes it better than the normal ones lol what joke anyone care to say different reason for this no there is none
Apple,iPhone 13,iphone mini gpu is core not core propro max is core gpu
Apple,iPhone 13,not remarkable change than the iphone
Apple,iPhone 13,best phone
Apple,iPhone 13,refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hi im trying to help horticulturist friend who needs an upgrade from their compact apple iphone apple iphone mm apple iphone mini mm difference mm regarding foliage image quality apple iphone mini review gsmarena team october camera photo and video quality photo quality main camera finally lets talk about the foliage its good but not great sometimes the photos show excellent trees and bushes sometimes smeared we expect this to be improved with each new iphone but alas this is not the year apples foliage skills get boost ultrawide the latest iphones shoot some of the widest photos weve seen so far while the automatic distortion correction is quite proficient the resolved detail is okay the noise is low the contrast is superb and the colors are once again impressively accurate the dynamic range has the same balanced approach as on the main camera not too low and not unnaturally high its not all great though here on these samples you can clearly see apples inability to handle foliage properly its not terrible but not that good either this camera has smaller sensor pixels and less detail is expected still sometimes the greenery is smeared badly and looks like an oil painting but at the end of the day these wide photos will end up on the social networks group chats or just shown through the photos app and they do look spectacular when downsized this device review is now over years old did it ever get an update to resolve or improve this foliage issue thanks in advance httpsmgsmarenacomappleiphoneminireviewpphp
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ive had few other iphones before am using iphone mini for half year now am little disappointed the touchscreen is not the best the camera cannot make photos on less distance than cm some apps dont run well and the unbelievable the iphone mini blocks working sometimes just slows down or stops on picture and does nothing
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,same here was waiting for mini so just bought mini instead while they are availabl more wow
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,was about to buy mini and unfortunately stopped mini really disappointed from apple same here was waiting for mini so just bought mini instead while they are available already have pro max but im fed up with the size and weight and im not going back
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,gsmarena can you tell me exactly where in the review is pointed out that the mini has poor more thats very true and easily noticeable in countries with poor internet and closed ac rooms elevators etc my friends who use apple products can confirm this use nokia btw so this phone has surprisingly better connectivity compared to their phones despite being outdated
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,lol wish had phone like that
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,if apple gets to squeeze the telephoto camera into the iphone mini im buying it as so more try or pro think it is small phone in this decade
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,someone help me choose recently for some ungodly reason went back to android and of course more why would you downgrade from an iphone se to budget moto anyway
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,second and the best phone from apple serieshad iphone like years ago it was after while switched to android and now when they released again compact got it immediately last year struggled about mini because of battery but now with mini im absolutely happy
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,just got it over week ago highly impressed replacement for my iphone everything want in phone compact light lots of juice etc works well snappy downsides low ram very expensive almost nothing in the box gee apple you csn do better for trn company greedy fruits
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ive got st gen se bought second hand as spare safari indeed is not the best browse more lol safari is not the best browser for the iphone clearly youve not used safari for years and even currently brave or opera is junk in terms of rendering features or security compared to safari have look on an independent and reputable mobile security site personally would not use opera on any device period
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,got one switched from android like the size and ios works fine but the safari web browser more ive got st gen se bought second hand as spare safari indeed is not the best browser for iphone go for either opera or edge ive even replaced original iphone keyboard with swiftkey and the difference is just amazing im gonna do the same with mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,then why is no manufacturer making compact phone many reasons people got used to bigger phones very less likely to move back to compact phones very few options available battery life is concern only apple has real compact phones rest all have smallest of bigger sized phones only few might switch to smaller phones from bigger phones only those who are currently using compact phones consider upgrading to latest compact phones and to do so there is no worthy upgrades companies have to redesign phones just to sell very less units companies dont want to waste time money
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hi apple do you give me or yourself chance to own non notch mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,you are wrong all it needs is better cooling copper double chambers and the will blow more then why is no manufacturer making compact phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,flagship compact phone simply cost more to design especially snapdragon or its equivalent ge more you are wrong all it needs is better cooling copper double chambers and the will blow your socks at full cpu speed with no throttling even years ahead the will triumph at watts thats almost as close with arm mighty socs
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,everyone who has been using sony compacts for the last few years should consider this mini sure changing from android to ios is drag but there are some neat features too overall its the most logical phone to own if you understand that size really matters bye sony its been swell
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,wish many people buy the mini series just so we get smaller android phones so many people more flagship compact phone simply cost more to design especially snapdragon or its equivalent generates so much heat so every maker tries to convenience everyone bigger is better for the maker bigger phone means less rd cost no need to consider how to squeeze more component into the body bigger battery to compensate the bad efficiency of the processor easier cooling solution also they are now selling bigger better better value while actually bigger easier more profits
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,we do not care whos we lmfao pipe down and speak for yourself
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,no fast charging is not problem
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,exynos of is way worse it would overheat and drain the battery faster
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,apple will never fulfill the necessity for those people who require thousands of customization more we do not care
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ur right the is bogus cuz of handicapped ios optimization that limits perfomance and it more apple will never fulfill the necessity for those people who require thousands of customizations billions of themes and zillions of custom roms
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,many iphone users just want basic smaller iphone nothing fancy and dont need more nobody said its useless or crappy its just meant for people who love compact size
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,dont want to be stuck with only gbs of ram forever already got and im happy more you dont even know what future proofing is ios requires very little amount of resources unlike android thats why iphones run much smoother compared to android competitors android phones might be better in other fields but apple is an absolute champ in terms of software optimization and performance
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hers question does filmic pro on it have access to the prores api basically dont want big phone with prores is there any infrared sensor
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,sony invented the compact flagship category am sure mini and mini were released befor more the mini and mini were not flagships they were mid range devices that looked like the flagship
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,when reviewing compact flagships how can you possibly omit mentioning sony who invented the more sony invented the compact flagship category am sure mini and mini were released before compact
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,thats the software ai it produces randomly generated details trying to get th closest more deep fusion is just bad copy of google cameras auto hdr algorithm google algorithm cant yet be matched by apple the same is true for other things google chrome better than safari google maps infinitely better than apple maps google assistant much better than useless siri
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,my point ya throttles when it gets hot its handicapped on mini it still performs better than most androids even when it is throttled and handicapped generates less heat uses less power runs at higher speed than snapdragons unless we know the exact cost of both else aeven handicapped version is just simply better than sd watch more teardown then you will know most flagship android phones uses lots of cooling material and tech to keep themselves cool while iphones use much lesser cooling solution but perform better ios is not better than android getting an iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ive had both minis and mini and my battery generally lasts all day am not more yes people cant stay min away from the phone then complain about battery endurance
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,it is yeah iphone cm iphone mini cm thats the screen width ok thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,it is called sharpening to make texture better than it really is apple and google love sha more no its not just sharpening have access to an iphone mini its digital zoom can produce totally wrong details due to machine learning deep fusion etc gsmarenas iphone pro review shows the same issue mentioned it in the iphone pro review comments the more test the iphone mini the more notice what crazy nonsense its digital zoom produces just took digital zoom photo of picture the picture showed giraffe in front of tree the iphone thought that the long neck of the giraffe is tree trunk so it replaced the part of the neck that was in front of the tree with green and it replaced the part of the neck that was below the tree with brown tree trunk also have the pixel and its digital zoom is terrible because it produces wrong detail as well in contrast to traditional digital zoom but the issue with the iphone is much much worse and in some cases the iphone produces extremely unnatural results due to totally overusing lightroomlike clarity effect
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,pretty much the same phone as the mini but battery life is one hour longer for video playback and browsing the web my mini didnt have awful battery life when had it but thats because turn off as see no difference with just like dont care about hz people are gullible to think this will be apples last mini iphone it will show up again by as the new iphone se apple uses the same chasis for years just like they used lightning port for years already the mini looks like nice phone not for me flip and razr are cooler to use smaller too when closed screen is protected as well just cant stand face id and ios so boring to use ios pretty much the same handcuffs that remembered from years ago
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,great review its convinced me to get one
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,what he meant was that both chips were disaster prob the worst chips in any aspect other th more exynos of is way worse
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,is not new performance loss to decrease heat cores disabled to more what he meant was that both chips were disaster prob the worst chips in any aspect other than perfomance
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the is much larger and does not compete with iphone mini the is still compact also mentioned zenfone and must have smool hands if inch or inch is not compact for you also the doesnt compete with iphone mini in sense it does the iphone mini wasnt released back then but its pricing is similar and can be compared no phone is supposed to compete with or brand
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,definitely didnt like the hz ipad mini screen even disregarding the jelly scrolling compared to my hz ipad pro but with the mini seem to be okay with the lack of promotion maybe its the smaller dimensions with content having to travel shorter perceived distance dunno opted for the mini over the pro in the end only been week but so far im happy can finally use phone comfortably in one hand while holding beer or walking the dog with the other
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,yes right the best latest qualcomms flagship chipset was sd the next series sd more is not new performance loss to decrease heat cores disabled to prevent heat huge difference between both situations none using is gonna disable
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,lol bionic and ios optimization change everything more importantly which android phone more ur right the is bogus cuz of handicapped ios optimization that limits perfomance and it throttles
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,for this you can get this spec on android for lol bionic and ios optimization change everything more importantly which android phone has such compact display at
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,iphone iphone se with punch hole display without face id that couldve drawn large number of even the huge android phone users
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the speaker is louder compared to mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,like how everyone is ragging on the mini and its lackluster sales but yet more thats because plans to put mini in production were already underway before the dismal mini sales materialized lol thats why theyre cancelling the iphone mini lol
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,successor of would be the overclocked version of since is the overclock of more yes right the best latest qualcomms flagship chipset was sd the next series sd and plus version having over heating making the brand have to throttling its performance to avoid power hungry for battery health qualcomm maybe forgot what happened by sd in the past
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,well thats what love gsmarena for they will tell you fact to me iphone does not really worth what people calls it to me its just some sort of hyping its not that dont like apple or hate it its just that people talk about it as if its the number their latest device have here the iphonepromax throttle alot during gaming and sometimes when not even gaming and king of feels warn dont let me say hot none of my games played at hertz not to say hertz and so many bugs even hate this latest ios will be getting an android smartphone from samsung as soon as they release one think this might be against gsmarena rules but its just what feel
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the camera turned to topnotch from great and the throttling while gaming went away totally on the cheapestsmallest device no less trustable reviews nice
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,absolutely love the iphone mini perfect size for me it is feature rich with good battery life all that want in phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,all flagship chips of throttle like hell lets hope fixes that highly do more successor of would be the overclocked version of since is the overclock of nothing else is different not new chip like
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the iphone mini is great for gaming believe it or not the phone handles all games hasslefree smoothly and with the best of graphics it doesnt appear to be throttling in games and doesnt get hot while doing it and it can keep offering such smooth gaming for at least hours before its battery falls to critical levels what game did you guys even run hours no throttling with best graphics is this supposed to be sarcasm
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,beautiful phone hope to buy one someday
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ive near sot for browsing than my new old stock but those are almost years old display is perfectly bright enough for outside even sunny days that puzzles me those comparisons of processirs benchmarks rebieweds battery usage brightness are they worth it not that like apple loath their shenanigans but android and samsung nor any better nowadays spying under the hood and locking down everything cloudshyte sure the battery will degrade fast iphone are ewwaste rapidly degrade in purpose we know that for long time in the end my feeling is were scammmed were tricked mockerrry especially with cloudshyte forcing to break everything even earlier require this or those or adding bugs and so on tied to them gafas china and brands even more were scammmmed
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,cult phone the best ever and apparently sale flop mini really imprives mini thought wouldnt notice but its clearly better really usable feel the weight difference anyway and the camera bump bigger quality feel lower prefer the old ones especially the rounded more confortable and looks better but people are what they are and thought edges looks more premium what bs and still nowadays reading that battery life is what it is perfectly manageable for my use the last one see you in heaven
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hey user personally have the xiaomi phone that is very efficient mah battery the more no thats not true no efficiency magic its old nm proc its all apple myths spread by user there are fe tricks to work around yes but youll have to worry of battery all the time got addicted to those little cuties ive mini and bought mini too cant wait
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hi is it worth it to upgrade from redmi note to iphone mini like how much faster more hey user personally have the xiaomi phone that is very efficient mah battery the iphone is they are equivalent efficienty for the majority of use cases not high demand cameragames and tictok but the mini will die quickier from the small battery yet the processor is more efficient
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,have had mine for two years now definitely not an iphone for power users but love it more than the rest nonetheless just wish it had telephoto camera
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,it might mini iphone come back with iphone same as ipad mini every years would diffinetely get
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,no chance at best for security updates true that

Apple,iPhone 13 mini,bought one animations are good same with the camera decent antutu scores really bad battery life and the screen is small but its mini phone so guess thats okay overpriced on release but now when you buy used one the price is worth it overall

Apple,iPhone 13 mini,this iphone is perfect for teenagers who are interested in photography and the battery is good more agreed just bought gb variant unlocked for usd great deal given theyre worth above albeit it is the last in the mini series im glad was able to get my hands on one for really good price
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,very compat phone and easy to use with one hand good camera perfomance worth for money can run about day without playing pubg cod
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,excellent device mini in normalusage
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,mine barely last day with charge for only doing like hours web browsing light gamingno more what did you expect from mah battery lasts whole day with heavy use
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,and the battery lasts almost days thats impossible if you are ope more yeah at most hrs on average use not more than that
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,anyone having screen flickering issue changing to bluish tint while flickering had to upgrade ios beta version problem solved as of nowwasnt working though tried reboot reset or tweeked display settings
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,got gb mini from day one bought the pro pro galaxy and just went back to more and the battery lasts almost days thats impossible if you are opening instagram or similar programs battery dies pretty quick in real life
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,what kind of issues battery not genuine unknown battery was genuine refusing to charge wired wireless battery would only display as until restarted delayhang hot temperature it kept rising so had to manually shut it down lot this is the update path took really liked the phone so it was sad to send it off guess dont have any luck with phones lol
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,little bit of an update really liked the phone but kept running into issues so sadly had to more what kind of issues
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,id like to see next iphone se with this form factor in essence you would like the name to change
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,know you are making those numbers up because have owned two different qhd phones before more mine is running android and im glad they at least optimized the battery life with the final few software updates battery life is entirely dependent on optimization not specs take those plethora of samsung and motorolabranded phones with mah batteries giving unacceptably lower battery life than whats suggested think its better choice not to streotype every android phone based on the handful of devices youve used as an apple supporter have no reason to make up numbers as my phone ended up being far better than my expectations
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,all of them have qhd displays and the screenon time for my nokia is hours minimum and up more know you are making those numbers up because have owned two different qhd phones before and they do not last hours with screen on unless they are sitting there doing nothing they can last hours without continuous use sure but at most you will get around hours of sot depending on what you are doing on them tested this on an htc same cpu as nokia and lg same cpu as pureview between those two the sd is way more efficient than both were used under android
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,its shame that apple didnt go along with these minicompact models and instead is making these stupidly large plus models that only chicks with daddy issues buy
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,lmao two of those have qhd screens im pretty sure that mah wont last more than more all of them have qhd displays and the screenon time for my nokia is hours minimum and upto whole day maximum think it should be better on the latter because of amoleds if thats the case then apple phones have far worse battery life from that metric
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,nokia sirocco and pretty easy lmao two of those have qhd screens im pretty sure that mah wont last more than hours with the screen on
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,abour battery life is very low you can disable some tracking features in your iphone also more thanks for the info just ordered an exdisplay mini gb in pink for battery capacity also going to pick up power bank as well just in case cant wait for it to arrive

Apple,iPhone 13 mini,pocket friendly means not compact but affordable or cheap price it said pocket friendly size that has nothing to do with the price or affordability

Apple,iPhone 13 mini,if apple would only make an iphone mini pro that would be the perfect phone would personal more it perfecly that fit in your pocket
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,make mini will buy it no body cares whether you use it or not iphone makers out there is trillion dollar industry and they are all set to make more money than everyone on this earth no body has ever came close to make this closed operating system remake the touch feel and everything it depicts is just unmatchable

Apple,iPhone 13 mini,keep backpedaling my dude trolling sure must be fun isnt it
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,perhaps you dont know that ming chi kuo and the information are not apple these are just more keep backpedaling my dude
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,will you people stop arguing nonsense
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,apple said or you read it on the verge website two different things just what im saying was quoting someone dumb who thinks that apple said they will never make an iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,this does not support the sentence apple said they arent going to make any mini models more apple said or you read it on the verge website two different things
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,httpswwwgsmarenacomapplekillsofftheiphoneminiherearethepricesofolderiphones more this does not support the sentence apple said they arent going to make any mini models its possible they do mini or mini no person at apple ever went to the press and said we will never make an iphone mini until the end of time you still cant cite and it doesnt look like that changes
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,perhaps researching is an unheard concept for you just few from this site httpsmg more perhaps you dont know that ming chi kuo and the information are not apple these are just rumors of people not working for apple unfortunately you cant discern that so you wont be able to get higher education because you cant properly cite and from your reaction it looks like you dont want to learn it either so you are stuck without higher education
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,it is grams and you can barely notice it in your pocket its very light phone and its almost the same size as the iphone and it has all the new technology but it small phone very intelligent
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,it is very heavy it is grams and you can barely notice it in your pocket
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,for some reason this iphone is cheap in my countryor think soso it costs around on my country
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,they quite literally did say that it is very heavy
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,give source you wont find one perhaps researching is an unheard concept for you just few from this site httpsmgsmarenacommingchikuodemandforiphoneplusweakerthanforminipromaxsurpassesitspredecessornewsphp httpswwwgsmarenacomreportappleiscuttingiphoneplusproductionnewsphp
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,they never said that they quite literally did say that
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,because apple said they arent going to make any mini models despite plus model selling more they never said that
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,this is the last mine we got and only possible way is that the se becomes new mini with outd more because apple said they arent going to make any mini models despite plus model selling even less than mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,so gonna answer the question this is the last mine we got and only possible way is that th more this is the last mine we got and only possible way is that the se becomes new mini with outdated specs and lower price why do you say so why is it not possible that they do for example mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,in india iphone costs less than mini now same in indonesia bro regular is cheaper than mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,slyly the greatest phone ever made
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,how about battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,pro pro better costs less for same perfomance and camera
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,mini or pro pro
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,no dont buy the mini if you want bigger battery pick iphone instead bcuz it has more in india iphone costs less than mini now
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,super phone like it
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,im thinking about getting the mini but ive never had an iphone before and us more no dont buy the mini if you want bigger battery pick iphone instead bcuz it has mah battery
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hi all im on the market for new phone im an android user but wanna try ios more hello went from android to ios and still android meanwhile yes the performance is amazing the phone is snappy and works amazing the battery is amazing for its size but if compare to bigger phones with bigger batteries inside then is only medium as for heavy gaming it can eat battery quite fast but for simple games it doesnt because the hardware is so powerful it doesnt utilise the gpu and cpu so much which saves battery the hz display helps here too use phone only with magsafe battery pack and didnt charge the phone for months my phone gets battery directly from battery pack and it is perfect size for this phone suggest to buy it with battery pack battery is outstanding and can handle whole day with heavy usage can say magsafe which iphone have is probably the best future technology in past years on the phones ditched my xiaomi pro even if it charges in only min it is easier to just use battery pack and have unlimited battery all the time dont forget it ios is love or hate personally love it it have it own weaknesses but still amazing os your call if regret no it is my first iphone but sadly probably the last one bought it only because of size but am not fan of bigger iphones design wise and handling my buying point was size security and limited battery it tick all the boxes and camera is still amazing only what truly miss is macro camera for text captures at first was sure will miss hz display but on phone that size dont even think about it the animations are so smooth that you completely forget about it bigger is the size sluggish the display works on this phone it works quite well because of its size am not person who recommend something because it is everything about personal taste but think mini is the best iphone apple ever made horsepower in small package
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,love it so much my first iphone perfect
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,please bring the mini series back apple ok thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,will share my opinion about the mini agree that the mini is the best phone ever had because of few reasons the cameras are good performance is amazing for smaller phone camera couldnt be better for such small phone and battery is solid for that size but never liked the apple and still agree that is the worst company with so many stupid employed ppl who dont know why the sales are so bad am in the scene about phones for years my first phablet was dell streak which is first big phone with android it is not samsung note samsung was just copy what makes sales bad is the specs for the price you pay for bucks you get which is bigger in ppl word bigger is better right and for that price is mini overpriced for sure but everything is possible to improve with just mm in size they can put bigger battery inside which can give of usage with pro motion display and magic island at least it gonna fell much bigger than with notch mini doesnt need more than hz on that small screen is really hard to fell hz but am sure it can increase the sales for more is better right thats how they say they can put gb of ram as minimum gb is not enough max bigger is better right for the same price they had but they didnt we know what company is apple they just want to grab so much money as they can and for that spec they would charges you which would be total fail and mini series must have different name it is just phone and not toy mini should be named iphone bigger version max or plus and top specs iphone must be ultra and with that am sure they can have more sales as proud owner of mini and switched to apple just because it is so small apple as company is disgrace for me and the product is overpriced for what it offers milking company
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,love iphone mini very much dont like big phones sad that apple stopped the mini series
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,or you wait for years and then you dont have to be rich you can just buy it used for more or that but im still hoping to get rich soon ie getting wellpaid job
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,its very amazing to think the size of this phone equals to an old phone with much smal more or you wait for years and then you dont have to be rich you can just buy it used for like the iphone today
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,pointing out the obvious huh if you want bigger battery you buy bigger phone most peop more use mine all day ive never run out of battery apple has the most efficient hardwaresoftware combination so they can get more battery life out of smaller batteries
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,inches is the perfect width for phone just small enough to hold in one hand without resting it on your pinky and you can reach the whole screen with your thumb the inch height means you arent constantly shifting it around in your hand trying to reach the top or bottom of the screen android take notes people are begging for phone this size not even with these specs just any one handed phone remember average means middle which means half the population has smallerthanaverage hands and cant hold modern phone theres reason apple is so popular its because people want phones not tablets
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,get the mini its really great one using since its came out great performance camera batt more yes nice and best phone for users who prefer small size smart phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,iphone mini possibility probably not but the good news is that the iphone se is back to life and will be released in assume it will get the iphone mini look and design
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,seems theres no stock in europe actually
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,id just oredered white mini would like to know if the fingerprints on the back will be more use case dont overthink it better safe than sorry
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,to make matters worse plus sells worse than and mini so yeah good job apple in terms of what people wants its good move mini nowadays its very limited marked people now are using phones way more and small screen doesnt make sense to much anymore sadly
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,technical question about the functions of the snapdragon modem in iphone please tell more even if it does apple wont enable any of those features and instead it will do so with newer models only
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hi matesdo you think that iphone mini is good replacement of the seif yes wh more if you are willing to use ios then absolutely
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,replacing the mini with plus size which already exists in the lineup in the form of the more to make matters worse plus sells worse than and mini so yeah good job apple
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,which phone is better between iphone mini and iphone pro go for mini updated cameras cpu battery etc
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hello have been using it for almost year no problems its great phone but its not for more thank you very much in the meantime finally bought the midnight gb versioncouldnt be happiger
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the issue with se minis is that they do not give high storage options the se gb vs more the iphone had gb options the had gb options the iphone se is in no way downgrade because it offers gb options still gb would be cool ofc
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hello dear users am about to switch from android to ios and decided to get mini canno more hello have been using it for almost year no problems its great phone but its not for everyone try it first before buying am switching to pro because of better camera and bigger screen only problem is battery for the first months had now have battery health but its still great for such small phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,can this iphone mini transfer video files to an external hard disk yes buy apple usb camera adapter this adapter will allow passthru charging for your harddisk
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,my new mini has dropped to in just months dropped to and then within days it more with every phone you can expect the same issue over time even if it says the top will drain as if it wasnt even there and the last will hold out as if it was actually
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,im having issues playing facebook videos only fb videos do not auto rotate even if toggle portrait orientation lockunlock it still doesnt rotate to landscape im using os and latest fb app anyone experiencing the same issue
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,bro iphone mini have gb option yes sorry my bad want tb mini like the pros
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,truley hopebelive that mini will resurect from dead in shape of iphone se if that woul more the issue with se minis is that they do not give high storage options the se gb vs iphone gb sometimes people want compact phone or the old look really hope they would do bto like macbooks and offer gb or tb se or minis do not mind waiting months or pay premium for such delivery
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,if you really looking for compact phone the se is the one
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,small but powerfull and mostly cheapest iphone to get this is apple best iphone in my opinion sadly it was discontinued
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,wanted compact size smartphone in the iphone category as have had used previously the iphone and iphone previously what loved about the phone was its design its built and its cameras what didnt like about the smartphone was its battery is weak and its over priced
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,love this phone its the best for my usage small footprint big screen and long battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the name might say mini but the size and name dont go together inch is mid size ph more but with aspect ratio and screentobody ratio the phone is smaller than older phones inch screens
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,after just almost months of use very happy with the phone battery still at health only some very minor scratches on the screen but have survived few drops at concrete dont hesitate to buy might as well use the glass screen protector and case the display is definitely not as resistant to scratches as advertised however surprisingly stronger shatter resistance proven on multiple drops
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,after months your mini had failed me in photography pictures taken which dont seem to be as great as my low end huawei
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,my phone battery lost within span of weeks now stays at is this normal purchased this phone on dec usually charge once in days with apple charger
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,you should buy this iphone every new version will be upgraded very satisfied after buying it anyone who hasnt bought or worn it please dont make bad assumptions
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,for those who wouldnt buy this phone because of the hz refresh this phone is so well optimised that the display feels like hz
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,just question for people with large fingers any feedback if with time it will become more you will use to it and there is no problems youll face later the keyboard its like normal smartphone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,yeah thats true have snapdragon and battery is sucks consider to replace with ip more did bro switched from snapdragon to mini its good move more stable battery is good and no hot issue like is my mistake
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,gsmarena battery tests are misleading iphonemini has much better battery life than samsung more yeah thats true have snapdragon and battery is sucks consider to replace with iphone mini found hot issue and one ui not stable as ios
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,please apple add fonts styles to the order one please
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,need looks as google pixel all features like apple mini thanks lot mate for your kind reply
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,they both have identical performance and camera but the has longer battery life and larg more thanks lot mate for your kind reply
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,may be due to recent updates or due to background running apps mine also battery is not performing well mints phone call can lose percent of battery
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,find now cool new and original design phone with jack is like back to the past years
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,kind of irritating with these major carriers and their network updates and forcing me out of my unihertz atom by december the unihertz is actually but lacks certain aspect was forced out of my iphone now my unihertz atom
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,on an android device maybe unless one intends to go two days playing heavy games or on consta more apple is great when it comes to battery life theyll just take small battery and optimize it lol
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hello everyone please does this iphone have overheating problems maybe using gps camera or more yes any smartphone will heat up while on gps playing games etc as it will use the processor the most
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,mine like to hrs what could be the matter may be due to recent updates or due to background running apps
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,great phone hope there will be iphone mini there wont the iphone models will be and only but id be surprised if they discontinue it forever it might become the next se
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,too own iphone mini from last year am getting sot around to hrs only that too when more mine like to hrs what could be the matter
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,just got mine last march came from samsung really love the compact size fits easily more too own iphone mini from last year am getting sot around to hrs only that too when charged though use the phone only for reading whatsapp and sometimes for calls was really surprised to see your sot around hrs hows that even possible
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,why tf cant anybody make phone like that on android hell id even switch over to more was able to purchase usbc to usbc cable with builtin usbc to lightning adapter on one end and usbc to usba on another its from mcdodo iirc carry iphone and android at all times so its lifesaver worth checking out if you can buy one where you are
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,wanted to buy this phone but considering the price will go for mini can anyone suggest are there major changes especially battery sot thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,mah is just too small on an android device maybe unless one intends to go two days playing heavy games or on constant social media the battery is not an issue
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,own this phone coming from and poco nfc etc the battery is definitely not too small more you can say that again have the but am definitely getting the mini soon
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,why is apple the only company with the courage to make nice mini phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,going to wait till they get rid of the notch lol the notch isnt bothering me
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,go for flip lol dont ask him he is just overly exaggerated about the phones being too big for him
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,still to damn big go for flip lol
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hi guys one of my friends wants to buy phone with these under details it should be com more wait for se
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,because of pandemic you need to wear mask all the time and honestly face recognition sucks th more face id works well without mask on but with mask on it doesnt even seem to unlock your phone even with mask on but imagine if ios fixes the pandemic issue you would never run into issues whatsoever
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,face id with mask works now on ios ya waiting for the new updated
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,own an iphone mini and its the best small phone with excellent stereo speakers outstandi more face id with mask works now on ios
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,want to leave my pixel to mini does mini have yap to wake is the camera more of course it has tap to wake and the camera is better
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,very good quality thats it still not that many possibilities as in android if you care about privacy and security grapheneos and this is example what android can do and forget about samsung or xiaomi garbage
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,have buy this completely rubbish device for my sons birthday honestly why does apple more why do you have to buy the mini for your sons birthday sounds like you are trapped in the apple ecosystem
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,where did you even get that number apple has percent market share worldwide followed cl more hes talking about the whole of android not just samsung
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,excuse me mean jobs or school or anything to do really just think if phone with hrs more anyways now is the holidays we are all at home so what do we use our phones my pixel lasts hours on screen doing light social media of course every day but that doesnt mean we cant critique manufacturers from putting larger batteries and making our lives easier as we have to charge less
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,my iphone se which is supposed to have abysmal battery life easily lasts me the day dont more yeah we have jobs but dont we come home from our jobs and use our phones what about in the train on the way home or even using our phones at work you still have to expect phone to last you through the day preferrably hours on screen on the bright side the next phone you get doesnt have to have good battery life could just get fe or motorola edge fusion
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,its wireless and magnetic nowadays type and lightning ports all come loose after time iphone mini is great phone just some ios updates keep messing with battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,android dominates the market with of the global market share while apples ios opera more there are so many android emulators and ereaders with android thats why there are so many androids
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,yea with an oled display dont think its that great oleds improve battery life compared to lcd
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,what were you talking about the mini had an upgrade to battery life yea with an oled display dont think its that great
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,mah lol what were you talking about the mini had an upgrade to battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,mah lol
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,if you were referring to the android market then look how garbage the sales were on recent an more android dominates the market with of the global market share while apples ios operating system controls
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,great size the bwst this what call mobile phone please do not discontinue mini great phone more too late they will discontinue the mini iphone soon because of poor sales the pro max however sell better than the android phones cuz have lost faith in android with more updates coming out it made the experience garbage
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,after had concerns about the battery have to say after weeks that these were unfounded come from pixel and have to say that the mini is the better android device the only thing really miss is the usbc port
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,bruh battery life on the new pro max is really good for activities easily get hrs more yes but hrs is easily possible with the mini as well so it makes no sense you discard the whole concept of compact phones for the battery life even though that is not even an issue
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,me too just dont think its beneficial to have mini sized flagship because of more my iphone se which is supposed to have abysmal battery life easily lasts me the day dont you all have jobs or why do you need hrs battery life per day
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,jesus man chile was just starting with facts about how garbage the sales were on recent android phones compared with the iphone that sells better thats my opinion and dont really want to argue with anyone else also we are closer to so have fun with the new year
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,fail to see what that has anything to do with minisized phones me too just dont think its beneficial to have mini sized flagship because of small batteries but glad avoided it for the pro max cuz think its good enough to last me through full day with no issues and single charge
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,was mainly referring to the android market with the iphone well think the mini is just more if you were referring to the android market then look how garbage the sales were on recent android phones on gsmarena they sell pretty terrible when compared to the iphone which were also sold pretty well after it was released every year and also merry christmas and hope you have trashy new year
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,well if we compare the and mini to the normal and theyre identical phones more was mainly referring to the android market with the iphone well think the mini is just less wellreceived than the regular and pro models the regular and pro will always do better in sales
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,it seems they just go and buy bigger phones anyway larger phones tend to have better more well if we compare the and mini to the normal and theyre identical phones spec wise and yet so many people bought the normal ones also think the fact that most android phones like the one you mentioned are huge suggests that these companies realized big phones sell better so thats why even entry level phones are now gigantic when in the past they used to be tiny
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,have big hands so naturally prefer big phones but can understand those who have small more it seems they just go and buy bigger phones anyway larger phones tend to have better specs and more variety so it makes sense as much important as small form factor is to them other factors also influence their buying decision theyll buy large phones if what theyre getting is worth the compromise for example the xiaomi mi screen is definitely too huge for me but man is that phone perfect for me in every other way id buy it for sure
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,exactly those people who hates big phones are nothing but whiny babies cuz they whine lot more mean dont necessarily hate big phones just find them cumbersome to use it is not cumbersome enough to complain about it but there is no denying that onehanded use is always gonna be bit troubling on these large screens this is not something that people can simply just get used to its physicalbody limitation not mental one recently switched from my lg to the oneplus pro and onehanded use has been awkward swear one day will drop the phone from trying to operate the phone in onehand and also the oppro is pretty heavy so the weight makes it slightly more prone to tipping and no dont have small hands but dont have large hands either im sure the ones with very large manly hands wont find any trouble with it
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,so if youre one of the people who wants small phone then get this there will be no mi more exactly those people who hates big phones are nothing but whiny babies cuz they whine lot like total idiots for me never had issues with it its due to other folks who never gotten used to it
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,maybe you can tell what you dont like about it or the genius bar or online chat could also more dont buy the iphone mini buy the pro or pro max which has the least worse battery life than the mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ios isnt really the worst os there are plenty of apps and games that you can download more am not referring to the apps there are more than enough apps in the app store the problem is the ios user interface and how ios is managed some people like ios and hate android from my point of view ios is nothing amazing and it is very limited os ios is faster and much less battery demanding than android plus google is paying champion it is insane how much data google is extracting from android phones plus bloatware on samsung is hard to describe
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,some of the things you have to consider about people who are going to be buying the iphone more switched from android samsung se to iphone mini gb main reason is size of the iphone mini like smaller phones and in android camp it is hard to find flagship with length of max mm iphone mini has much battery samsung is horrible when comes to battery life phone is very fast and responsive cameras are great but ios is from my point of view horrible os which hate and am trying to understand the logic of ios but only logic see it that apple is lazy to make any improvements if there is in the future any android flagship with length up to mm and will gladly switch because ios is something which needs major upgrade ios is the worst os have ever used so far used android and windows phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,apple iphone mini vs apple iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ok but wanted to buy phone and not brick it may be bothersome to you but actually never had issues with the size thats bigger you see like big phones more than small ones but the extra weight is well worth it
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,here are the reasons why the pro max is great they have macro mode hz photogr more ok but wanted to buy phone and not brick
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,doubt that you own the even when you say that its way too small for your small more some of the things you have to consider about people who are going to be buying the iphone mini is that they might not have enough money for something like the pro max and while you could argue that they should then buy the iphone or that would lead right into my next argument the iphone mini has the second best camera in an iphone to date and many people like taking pictures of them and their family as well as anything else they might want but hear you saying then why dont they just get an android theyre so much broader in what they offer however iphones offer four things androids dont ios stability security and the apple ecosystem though security isnt necessarily something only available to iphones it is much harder for viruses trojan horses and any other type of malware to infect iphones and people like that security stability involves the fact that iphones are updated for years and years after their release meaning that people will have to spend less on phones because they only buy phone every years as opposed to years lots of people also likeprefer the apple operating systems and this combined with the lack of irremovable bloatware means that its pretty easy for nontech savvy people to use all of this is to say people should buy whatever phone they want dont hate androids as it is really innovative and interesting market just think that all phones can be considered the best in their own right and the phone should fit the person not the other way around
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hated it to small and ios sucks sold brought one ui better easier nice size don more doubt that you own the even when you say that its way too small for your small hands your crappy informations wont be legit but some do have good benefits so good luck with crappy one ui and their overrated exynoses maybe the fe will be fixing that issue soon in so the snapdragon variant and exynos variant will both be sold outside the us even if you want the latest and most hottest phone dont really see any reason to pay the same price for the mini so in that case would recommend the max over the mini just because it had longer battery life the pro max lasted all day long with moderate use to heavy use
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,inch lol need magnifying glass to see the screen well then just buy the ipad pro as your phone if your eyesight is that bad or you may also consider getting glasses
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,it does not have dual selfie camera yes why would you need that when you have one wide angle selfie camera that you can just crop in from
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,how is this battery life az campare to ipone xs ipone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,if you are after point and shoot camera as the main function dont buy this phone act more what kind of example thread is that hes complaining about the front camera being poor in low light and your telling us not to buy it for point shoot
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,ive actually ordered one today to replace my halfyearold galaxy se because many people say that the battery life is fairly decent actually the screen isnt that small my old favorite galaxy has smaller screen and never thought it was small have tiny hands and this phone seems to tick all boxes
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,did you ignore the pixel maybe you should try pixel or zenfone or wait for xiaomi mi is also rumoured to be smaller phone than predecessors maybe you should also consider some sony phones since they are slimer than most phones am also thinking of switching toca smaller phone and zenfone would be my first choice
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,missing back button is not big problem because there is back swipe swipe from the left edge more thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,anybody here using dual nano sim variant china hongkong thank you
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,selfie camera is of fixed focus does it capture like pro models thank you you can always check the phone review and compare them by clicking on the review button
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,am still using pro but just rebought this the form factor is so good am only on second charge but get good battery life have done this since charge battery to full discharge flat then charge to full times then do what want with battery since use in day then charge overnight ready for use next day this pro is at battery health and get through day with it undecided what to do but at moment most likely selling pro keeping this just pops in jean pocket so easy to handle and no compromise uninterested in hz promotion video etc as just use the phone as is point and shoot style got white version nearly got pink
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,where live this phone costs less than the normal how much of difference is there more the difference is usd in our country
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,which is worth to buy as of their price today mini mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,after hrs screen on time battery left cannot complain one thing is one my finger keep blocking main camera design flaw and one time not charging glitch which restart fixed
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,sad battery life you have to charge it every day why next youre gonna say is grass is green
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,hey people got to know that iphone mini loses about percent on standby of about hou more yes used to have the mini for months and its visible change in better without any special settings than before the mini has straight line of battery drainage when im sleeping about half per hour sometimes even less apart from this dont have more to share as dont spend hours on the phone nor do use it for gps related stuff but trust it for about hours sot and charging to every hours with hours screen on average
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,its above dollars in my country and some of them are still wondering dhy do they cal more well technically it is flagship phone so it is expected to have that price also this is apple were talking about here also it usually the smaller and stronger the phone the more expensive it is due to harder engineering
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,does iphone mini has dual physical nano sim in hongkong or china mainland no bought mine in hk is esim nanosim or dual esim
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,comfortable size excellent overall then theres gaming web browsing and movies which are more enjoyed on bigger screens of course
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,perfect size could be bit smaller too completely agree love the smaller phones
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,not just there should be micro mini of inch display as well apple rocks with small more perfect size could be bit smaller too
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,im still waiting for android oems to jump on the mini bandwagon so far only asus attem more sony have been making compact phones for years
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,android manufacturers just dont have an arm chip or operating system efficient enough to get more snapdragon xx series and mediatek pseries would like to know your location
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,im so excited to get this one next month
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,why companies who usually copying apple ideas design and features dont copy the kille more android manufacturers just dont have an arm chip or operating system efficient enough to get good battery life out of small phone its that simple really until the chip makers and google get the efficiency right they just cant compete with battery life in this size phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,pleaseplease keep on making the mini phones its excellent size wouldnt mind even little smaller like thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,dear apple please do not discontinue iphone mini please dont too late they are doing it because the mini is probably the last variation that apple has ever made regardless of whether the rumor is true or not there wont be an mini instead there will be max
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,zenfone is smaller and shorter check the data you dont seem to understand said almost the same size as to comparing the size gap between the zenfone and iphone mini read comprehend
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,what colour are people buying fancy product red for first time ever
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,should upgrade from iphone gb please suggest thanks lot of course
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,technically zenfone and have almost the same size zenfone is smaller and shorter check the data
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,have samsung not the plus model have to say its been beast of phone years old still going strong however this mini has really got my attention like others im getting tired of phones always going bigger after several reviews seems to me may be making switch when the time comes have looked at the new samsung flip phone and at first was interested but believe ill stay with the barform factor mini just seems to have lot of features that simply put just stack up in the right places im not much on taking professional photos dont game do surf some but otherwise dont see the need for the iphone size just some thoughts enjoy
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,from my pixel to iphone mini disappointed with iphones camera especially in lowlight ios widget good addition but extra pages left and right is annoying love the size snd itsg no hz screen look acceptable
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,am not mistaken the international and hong kong versions have mmwave bands
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,no one likes returned my iphone pro max to get the iphone mini and still more love my mini after months of fairly heavy use it still has battery health too
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,prefer bigger screens for movies and games and so on but will be getting this for my gran more for movies prefer my home tv together with the family in the sofa for games prefer my index vr headset which inmerse me in the game for typing messages like this laptop or home pc for phones nothing like the palm palm
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,sorry but still want screen that is usable and iphone mini has just that at least for more prefer bigger screens for movies and games and so on but will be getting this for my grandma its awsome how its even smaller than se even with the power and camera and battery size and so on pretty good
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,definitely people wants smaller phones thats the reason apple continues the mini and se line more sorry but still want screen that is usable and iphone mini has just that at least for me iphone se size fits perfectly in my hand and has comfortably big screen compared to what we had with iphone and iphone mini has bit taller screen but still good to reach and the phone is bit shorter understand that if you have big hands or sausage fingers then the iphone or even pro max size is probably better to use and they are getting longer battery life too which is great for them but it just doesnt personally fit me as well
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,my grandma knows nothing about what specs are and such but wana buy it for my grandma she has the se right now and since she only likes small phones wana get her this phone for these specs and such is very good basically steal compared to paying an extra
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,good improvements now make mini with hz and se with lcd and price
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,for iphone mini what waste mah iphone and android battery management system is quite different they include little battery but last longer even than typical android phone is some case you definitely didnt use an iphone so youre laughing for nothing
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,definitely will jump from old iphone to go for mini version since im onehandle use
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the pink one looks the best
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,am keeping my iphone will wait for the notchless model and maybe flat camera bump like on iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,good look
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,really appreciate these mini series its so sad that all these android smartphone companies are too focused on creating giant phones that they forgot not everyone is comfortable with using such giant displays is the perfect size to use onehandedly its small and compact enough to feel like youre not carrying around huge brick im an android user but appreciate apple for making this phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,people here complaining about only gigs of ram while am using this old used iphone xr wi more android isnt terrible both oses just work in different ways
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,dont know why android phones are sleeping but if some brand start with compact phones like sony and get there hz around inch oled screen it will be more sick than this except less price and more battery
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,lol half this comments is apple fans other half is android include me who wish there was more xperia iii maybe
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,people who love black phones take care the midnight finish is not true black like that of the iphone or or it is rather very very dark blue that is almost blackish blue same goes for starlight vs white if its ok with you then never mind the comment but if itd bother you then do not preorder and wait to see the actual iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,asus zenfone true though zenfone is moreso compared to the zenfone iphone and since they all have the same size the iphone minis have no direct comparison size wise
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,prime is inch bigger yet has mah battery so
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,why not hz screen
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,god bless youlast phone was samsung seand everything die aftet that lol half this comments is apple fans other half is android include me who wish there was android phone in lol
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,not all people have the money to buy and have two smartphones at the same time smh the iphone mini can actually be persons main device you dont need secondary device its so cute and handy
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,who said that nobody likes smaller phones whenever buy new phone the first thing check more you gd dmn right
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,what about the asus zenfone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,time to replace my samsung se with iphone mini gb will take some time to get familiarised with ios and probably will never like icloud and itunes but this is the only true powerful normal size phone on the market probably the last
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,only gb of ram its not slow android that needs billion ram to run
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,still no usbc iphone mp camera gb ram whats wrong with that big notch and why so expensive for this low spec phone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,perfect size my had iphone mini last spring returned it after weeks because of more thats why its called mini it has mini in its name what were you expecting at this point im not even sure if you really bought mini and just came here to hate
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,the best ever iphone ever to be released by apple the iphone mini and do you know why my compliment does not match with my angry emoji cause it is not like android yet but the hardware is good
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,have only gb ram you had at specs gb ram before pro models has before gb ram at specs now only gb whats true gb and gb or gb and gb
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,euros but no telephoto
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,like need inch iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,really like this size shame there isnt more sub inch screen sizes on android galaxy mini perhaps
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,did you mean this httpswwwgsmarenacomasuszenfonephp zenfone is more comparable in size to the iphone not the iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,that is really fantastic great
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,really still that heckin lightning connector
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,there are phones with much better batteries than this iphone same size
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,another elegant iphone to the collection hopefully better chip sustaining by that stalling form factor of the battery but otherwise nice option although people will opt out for the promax models due to the size
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,so it turns out that fuss about low sales of mini version was just fake news definitely apple sees profit in compact phones hope this brings samsung to some sense hope they launch good iphone mini competitor in early atleast asus and pixel phones are ok but true compact phone of inch from samsung is all we want and that too without compromising jack card sim battery and samsung is fully equipped to do this as well nm processors advanced stacking solutions of ram and storage vertically over one another thin displays proprietary camera and battery tech etc dont know whats stopping them from releasing good compact phone bet its more profitable segment compared to all non flagship phones samsung has launched this year none of the samsung phones this year were interesting
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,with this size would be nice if it can run android did you mean this httpswwwgsmarenacomasuszenfonephp
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,perfect for me for outdoor easy on pockets
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,well battery life remains to be seen how good it would be mah would be sweet spot in battery and huge upgrade all things considered
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,looking at the thickness number definitely hope that this model will have bigger battery than last years mini the new iphone pro maxderived main camera sensor is welcome upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13 mini,battery life quite low issue pro non pro and mini smartphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yes id highly recommend the pro as you can find many great deals on it with tons of more in the specification ive readi didnt see anything concerning the networking sim slot cause heard iphone pro support hardware sim and an esim what to confirm about this before buying the pro model
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im upgrading from can get pro for under with new battery but recondi more yes id highly recommend the pro as you can find many great deals on it with tons of storage still competes with the latest iphone at fraction of the price hope you enjoy your new phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone is the best phone have seen
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,pro or plus pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bought pro gb on ios and im not sure to update it to bcs read lot of users experiences of new ios and so many issues mean ios is not geat bcs is on early version and cant update it to only any opinion about ios update tnx
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,do you miss autofocus on selfie photos is iphone pro better for selfie photos thanks to au more oh my god
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,best iphone so far
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,nice camera awesome tottally enjoy it keep working apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,have problem with my measurement app when ever open it closes by it self
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,having used android for many years switched to ios and to iphone pro this year my impressions are positive the pictures the pro takes are impressively rich in color and the phone works very quickly faceid is generally accurate but if you have glasses and remove them it may require several shots before recognizing you for me the weaknesses of the phone are two it tends to heat up more than the vanilla which another family member has especially when using the chip or when playing graphicsprocessorintensive games it is considerably heavier than other competitors in this size and the weight will take getting used to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,winner
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,as an iphone pro user this is my first and hopefully the last iphone will own considering the price have clearly love the new color green and its camera quality
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hi to all apple gurus here would like to ask whether there is significant or noticeable more the difference between the vanilla and pros is even more noticeable than the difference between the and lineup the pro got another additional gpu core and adaptive hz pro motion display so if you have money lying around the pro will be best buy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,as someone that switched from the to the iphone and its eco system for the first time im pleasantanly surprise how well the device holds up outside of its lack of user customizability or ease of it can see why many ppl opt for iphone then any other android device hope ios helps improve and catch up to androids more robust software implementations
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,my first iphone the best phone ive used till date in terms of picture quality privacy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone is hard to close apps the bar under the dots should be moved up so you can close apps easily very hard to close apps down all the way when using air pods apple loads the last song on the front screen that keeps playing you can not shut it down or turn it off have apple music loaded will open songs when want to will probably try another app the above two cons mention use battery life if they are not going to put close down button on the screen then move the app line at the bottom of the screen up am hating the phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,think get the as samsung first the feature same more comfortable and good performance did phone is very nice to meet
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,there wasnt lag in this phone which believe your informations are false true right good thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,why my iphone pro always blurr view when take picture cannot get their sharpness years usage what problem
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,here in turkey iphone pro gb is tl dollars and galaxy is tl dollars so there is much bigger difference than you say even galaxy ultra tl dollars is much more cheaper than iphone pro for those wondering this price difference is due to huge taxes there is tax on smartphones in turkey while apple imposes direct taxes to its retail prices and sells in turkey samsung makes special pricing for turkey
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,more lag with this phone there wasnt lag in this phone which believe your informations are false
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone is expensive period think get the as samsung first the feature same more comfortable and good performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,here ppl talking about golden reviewer how about you watch iphone pro max vs pixel pro google had the edge the saturation was also just perfect
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,its not the best by any means its not even top maybe top nobody is pr more dude any companies are far from perfect and im not typical apple fan im actually normal person whatever the words you say makes me think youre troll unless you have relatives in the admin now get life and stop spreading lies in this site you whiny baby
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,actually the iphone promax camera is the best on any phone currently out and im more its not the best by any means its not even top maybe top nobody is praying to anyone stop bashing him and actually look at his videos where he exposed the flaws of iphone pro series to support his argument
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone camera is simply not as good as golden reviewer exposed you are too afraid to face more actually the iphone promax camera is the best on any phone currently out and im not even an apple fan use galaxy note but apple has the best camera currently golden retriever is just one reviewer and not some kind of oracle or god stop praying to him and form your own opinions
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this device would be lot better if it actually had charger in the box hell even old school earphones would be very much appreciated the design is simply recycled the notch is still there apple is definitely only popular for the name not for the performance itself as this device is gonna get destroyed by other flagships
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,who do you trust single reviewer who has subs or the vast majority who praise the photo more the vast majority wont get free iphone review samples in the future their criticism and entire review is closely monitored by apple the guy with subscribers is lot reliable because he exposed every brand he is honest as evident by him praising the ipad pro but exposing the pro series for their weaknesses he doesnt need apple to tell him what he should be saying and what he shouldnt he doesnt rely on videos being approved by apple before publishing he buys his own phones and gives honest reviews did you read the top comment on that video if not go read again
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,well trust golden reviewer till then hes just nitpicking and mostly make negati more we trust golden reviewer not some apple troll that has been banned several times on this site the fact that you are so desperate that you lie about android to make ios look good confirms to me that android is something that you will always be envious of even after decade long struggle to become the default choice ios still remains as niche leftover operating system tier operating system desperately trying to stay relevant by trying to copy grand daddy tier operating system of android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,start your own youtube channel analyzing phones bought with your own money so you arent more well trust golden reviewer till then hes just nitpicking and mostly make negative videos no wonder he have so few views even when he use apple in title which usually makes lot of traffic just shows how most people dont take him serious and its easy to see why he just find single flaws and makes video about them like they are end of the world and use very dramatic titles and hoping to get lot of views by doing that but noone buy or dont buy device based on that people want to see overall picture about product and golden reviewer sucks badly on that he even admitted that his daily driver is pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone camera is very good golden reviewer doesnt know much about photography like his more start your own youtube channel analyzing phones bought with your own money so you arent at the mercy of samsung apples control over tech media develop some credibility with the audience after unbiased analysis then well take you seriously well trust golden reviewer till then
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,lol he rated the iphone and the samsung mi ultra has larger sensor than samsu more iphone camera is simply not as good as golden reviewer exposed you are too afraid to face facts as evident by you trying to avoid watching that video since the consequences would mean the little bubble you live in gets destroyed
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,how much of lie can you be if you think thats awful show me the sources out of billion people only know that photo will be shot by touching the screen on the phone and phone reviewers around the world think that every phone buyer is pro in photography
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,for example during nighttime shots when zoomed in the mi ultra sometimes looks better more guys like golden reviewer and others have already exposed the flaws of pro max that rarely gets talked about by these youtube reviewers he even went on to rate the iphone camera if hed rate the galaxy ultra ultra isnt even top camera on android imagine how far behind iphone pro max is at the end of the day cheap tiny sensor cant stand with the big boy sensors on android flagships check out his statement the top comment in that comparison video on youtube on other reviewers essentially exposing the embargo brigade
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,didnt even read your comment because you have already been exposed to be an apple trol more yes you did just exposed you and other fanatic android boys stop lying you couldnt answer anything to it because all those were facts just read this and accept the reality android flagship phones arent as good as you guys try to make them look and thats why people are leaving them behind they just dont meet the value for the price android is cheap phones thing and its ok in that environment noone expect much but it just cant compete in flagship environment people are buying iphones when they want something better samsungs poor sales are an android flagship problem httpswwwdigitaltrendscommobilesamsunggalaxyspoorsalesanalysisandroidproblems
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,guess my comment hit you because you had nothing real to answer reality is btch isnt more didnt even read your comment because you have already been exposed to be an apple trollll your posts are ignored just like the ramblings of fanatic
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,majority of the members on this site dont take you seriously trollll you cant cha more guess my comment hit you because you had nothing real to answer reality is btch isnt it you just proved that everything what said was right and you cant deny it because numbers are out people arent buying android flagships those sell very poorly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,android flagships are well ahead of iphone pro max then why wont peop more majority of the members on this site dont take you seriously trollll you cant change name and hide willlllllyyyyyyyy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,why do need zoom camera for judging image quality out of main sensor were you dropped on more android flagships are well ahead of iphone pro max then why wont people buy them you guys keep talking about these so called better devices all the time and yet reality shows that more and more people are leaving them behind for example galaxy family sold record low million why this happens that not even samsung fans buying their flagship phones anymore there was just research saying iphone family is selling so well because there isnt relevant rivals on the market and thats reality
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,but guess you guys have gotten used to mediocre hardware and software over the years more majority of the members on this site dont take you seriously willlllllyyyyyyyy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,in my opinion if phone makes image look better without zooming in it doesnt more for example during nighttime shots when zoomed in the mi ultra sometimes looks better than the pro max but when things are not zoomed in the mi consistently oversaturates the surrounding area making the photos worse it really doesnt matter if the zoomin quality is worse if you can just zoom in using telephoto camera look at technicks comparison
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,over an over it has been proven to that big sensor are indeed better iphone images fall apar more but guess you guys have gotten used to mediocre hardware and software over the years mediocre hardware what phone on the market have better hardware overall than pro and pro max and mediocre software is android its big fragmented mess where everyone does their own thing without guidelines or rules this end up as huge mess where nothing really fits together but guess you guys have gotten used to it because you havent experiencing anything better theres reason why so few buy android flagship phones anymore the experience just isnt worth of asking price anymore sametime apple is enjoying close to record iphone sales
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the iphones strength has never been zoom in my opinion if phone makes image loo more in my opinion if phone makes image look better without zooming in it doesnt matter if the quality deteriorates when its zoomed in if the quality detoriates after zooming in it means it is the one with inferior image quality as it doesnt happen for other phones with big sensor which have power to resolve much more detail and less noise even the quality of images from budget phones looks great at first glance the devil is in the details the same image quality falls apart once you dive in deep this is what separates the phones with expensive big sensors and phones using cheap priced tiny sensors
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,people are still buying realme series you asked me which phone with mah battery gives hr endurance rating told you the answer thus concluding that redmi note pro is far from having one of the best battery life on android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,realme people are still buying realme series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,just to rectify that iphone pro is not waterproof but water resistant
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bruh watercolor paintings think you need your eyes checked over and over again apple more over an over it has been proven to that big sensor are indeed better iphone images fall apart after zooming in lack of detail unnatural colors more noise etc which are all characteristics of using small sensor they can do all their hdr trickery by calling it deep fusion and all but in the end they are trailing behind flagships with bigger more expensive sensor cheap tiny sensor inferior image quality tell apple to put more money on big sensors cant understand why how ios users accept one cheap internal component over the other but guess you guys have gotten used to mediocre hardware and software over the years
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,like really this camera is absolutely horrible for flagship maybe wouldnt mind if more bruh watercolor paintings think you need your eyes checked over and over again apple proves that bigger sensor does not equal better camera quality just another example this year
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,lmao get lost etc typical ifanboy insults when no arguments iphone camera is pretty awful more how much of lie can you be if you think thats awful show me the sources
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,apple does use deep fusion when night mode is not used in low light conditions thats more any sort of interpolation algotithms produces wrong details to an extent upscaling or even demosaicing since they all try to guess the values that have not been captured using the information from surrounding pixels good nonmlbased scaling algorithms such as lanczos can produce welldefined edges that do not look fuzzy and so apple is not necessarily using ml for digital zoom here its also worth pointing out that apples usual heavy image processing plenty of sharpening clarity boost and noise reduction is applied to those images alongside interpolation eliminating whatever the real textures that have been present in the original image and turning them into very unnatural looking oil painting mess
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,how am wrong when youre probably misleading yourself lmao get lost no one cares more lmao get lost etc typical ifanboy insults when no arguments iphone camera is pretty awful if you cant accept it check your eyes or brain but then again no one cares about your opinion but other ifanboys
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,stop the nonsense was great camera when it came but it cant keep up anymore phone more larger sensor is fine on the pro max it does the job better although it has some really good benefits to keep in mind
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,different league which is named too much money for too little dont be foole more if youre such happy android user we wouldnt be seeing you in comment section about an apple device it seems that your material insecurity has gotten the better of you that youre always sticking your inferior preference on other people sad
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,wrong wrong and wrong again the truth is born in comparison only bet you never seen nok more how am wrong when youre probably misleading yourself lmao get lost no one cares what your opinion will be why havent the moderator disabled the comment section like macrumors
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,which one realme
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so keep your childish insults first of all youre the one who is insulti more wrong wrong and wrong again the truth is born in comparison only bet you never seen nokia full res photos up to today there is nothing comparable in phone cameras
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the feel of the iphone pro is solid very sleek design these types of phone are the best in build quality many cheaper phones despite being top grade do not have this quality of build
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,awesome phone really good battery score mine is coming thursday thats in days and obviou more wise choice you will be on high what see here is war of fans why war everybody can be winner we all have free will to choose what suits us with so many models of phones people are spoilt for choice truth is there will always be fans of opposing brands what some of you should do is spread the love not war competing in an online game on your different devices then you can see which phone is no
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,research is already done it sucks live with it and no its not the dollars speaking more so keep your childish insults first of all youre the one who is insulting second you have no clue what im taking about third dont care if it sucks probably because of larger sensors and aperture size that is bigger on the main lens meaning it could get more light in but thats expected to get better on the ultrawide and lastly megapixels dont really count as the best picture it obviously has to do with photo processing colors exposure pixel size and aperture size
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,lol no one cares your sources and informations are full of insecure and unreliable the more oh and forgot you have no clue what im talking about speakerwise the zenfone also has loud stereo speakers the difference being that the sound quality is way better because it actually has bass theyre not even comparable
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,then dont come back unless youve already done some research before buying the more research is already done it sucks live with it and no its not the dollars speaking but eyes you ifanboys usually have an argument that if you dont like you cant afford nah buy flagships flagships if we are talking about camera so keep your childish insults
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,beat or equals in what peak performance watts used im everything in wh more in everything
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,realme mah phone giving hr redmi note pro is far behind phones like these which one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,oh yeah the best phone for battery is the energizer pk power max good luck carrying that ar more realme mah phone giving hr redmi note pro is far behind phones like these
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the little cores of the iphones tie or beat the performance cores of the so it more beat or equals in what peak performance watts used im everything in what type of task
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,use it on my phone because have the option tomeanwhile iphone users dont even more congratulations
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,redmi note pro isnt the best phones for battery iphone is way behind atleast more oh yeah the best phone for battery is the energizer pk power max good luck carrying that around the redmi note pro was listed as the best battery phone on gsma as well since the iphone is like hours ahead of the redmi itll probably tie with the other contendors
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,that will be great for those people who actually use it on phone use it on my phone because have the option tomeanwhile iphone users dont even on the pro max model the bigger screen cant utilize the entire display cant have more row of icons such an antifunctional handicapped mess
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,at least it got split screen that will be great for those people who actually use it on phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the problem with iphones and ios is that you have lot of crap switched on by default switch off all the unnecessary location tracking and background refresh for apps that simply dont need it and battery life improves massively there are plenty of videos on youtube to advise on that but as said all that stuff really should ahve been switched off by default
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,dark then if its oversaturated like xiaomi xiaomi have issues with oversaturation am taking about video in low light its all dark you cant see anything you can on other phones with big sensor
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,media are joke its too wide to use seems like you have no clue what your more no need to research just go in the store and handle the phone yourself
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,cooler no faster and more stable lol get outta here iphone got stability in mark wildlife stress test while zenfone got pretty sure zenfone is more stable and doesnt throttle as much as iphone and the mini disaster
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,split screen on phones are gimmick best reserved for tablets you will change your mind when apple invents it in
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,best tech in compact phones nah iithink thats the zenfone which remains lot more more cooler no faster and more stable lol get outta here
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,really the iphone camera is horrible have you ever been near an iphone go bu more velvet painting pics you just described iphones jpeg processing effectively
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,outstanding in what the video is all dark in low light dark then if its oversaturated like xiaomi xiaomi have issues with oversaturation
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,guess its subjective what may look good for some people may not look that good for others more outstanding in what the video is all dark in low light
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bruh are you really that high or what the camera quality on the pro max are really outsta more guess its subjective what may look good for some people may not look that good for others in my experience samsung ultra and xiaomi mi ultra does take better jpeg pictures than the iphone pro however when it comes to video the iphone pro is the more outstanding one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so enjoy your best cameraphone and stop spamming apple reviews or do sense more best cameraphones and dont spam mentioned that camera is horrible and after that just answer to insecure apple fanbois if you didnt notice peace and enjoy whatever you enjoy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,have best cameraphone flagships ever made so jokes on you and no iphone has never more so enjoy your best cameraphone and stop spamming apple reviews or do sense lot of insecurity in your posts
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,dont criticize anything dont know about probably fine phone but not the came more thanks for your input email dxomark and talk about them
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,as former xiaomi owner it really cracks me up when people compare them to iphones iphones more different league which is named too much money for too little dont be fooled by their clever marketing and be happy that you paid almost double for same specs in android world
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,come on give apple little bit chance youre destroying their company dont criticize anything dont know about probably fine phone but not the camera those samples were pain to watch
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ive never seen so many cons in star review is that really the score more yes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,best photography balance out there an excellent phone overall with the best support in the more like really this camera is absolutely horrible for flagship maybe wouldnt mind if it was on top of euros phone but for flagship this is disaster no detail over sharpening halos etc in some pictures you can even see samsunglike oil paintings
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,thats what happens when you use mp sensor and try to extrapolate via algorithms to more who told you colors are accurate on iphone iphone gives punchy and oversaturated output like samsung device since the past couple of years android gives option to choose between natural output and social media ready images
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,pro max is only criticized by media for its weight not its width mm when phone wi more media are joke its too wide for comfortable usage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,incorrect the iphone pro scored hours on web browsing and hours on video play more redmi note pro isnt the best phones for battery iphone is way behind atleast plus android phones ahead of iphone in endurance rating and iphone without terrible optimization is running at hz most of the times
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,apple is offer best tech in more compact phones the iphobe pro and the iphone mini nothin more best tech in compact phones nah iithink thats the zenfone which remains lot more cooler than and stable while the mini and the smaller iphones are thermal throttling disaster
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,shrinking down the display is not polished its hard to type and focus reachability is better more hard to types an focus android has option of shrinking it to various screen sizes ios has none
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,nearly hours of web browsing time and over hours of video playback time dont more doesnt matter if standby is time is poor you are forgetting people use it as cellular phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,and of that greater capacity what cores in the processor is the iphone doing its task on more the little cores of the iphones tie or beat the performance cores of the so it doesnt matter
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,problem is that on the iphone pictures look deadso to speakthey are not alive at all it is more iphones have the best camera but it has to do with photo processing colors quality exposure pixel size and aperture size on the wide camera it looked fine mean it has the larger pixel size so it should be good for low light pictures
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so basically it is heavy throttles quite lot under heavy load has mediocre hertz suppo more lol no one cares your sources and informations are full of insecure and unreliable the speakers sounds loud which has stereo audio but keep in mind that samsung has the loudest speakers on the ultra faster charging is fine but your facts about hz displays are less likely to be true grow up
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,you need real pro camera then not camera phone current flagship camera phone any bran more problem is that on the iphone pictures look deadso to speakthey are not alive at all it is all so dullit kinda ruins the photos
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,cinematic mode is so bad green screen mode activated all pros are laughing then dont come back here unless youve already done some research before deciding to buy the pro or pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,except thats not how you really use your phone dynamicc usage will surely give you more if youre light user then there are certainly android phones that have larger battery capacity and last longer than iphone pro per single charge since apples aseries socs generally consume more power than sdkirindimensity in idle but if you use your phone more frequently or do lot of cpugpudemanding tasks that will be an entirely different story
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,tbh the zenfone doesnt laot of stuff this iphone does at just slightly above half the price it has great display not that bright but nits is enough and similar batteryonly hr be difference with gast chip maybe not as potent can but would sya the uw cam and main cam lok flagship grade other competitors gsmarena are also vaible
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,cons stale looks the notch should have been gone by now compact as it may be the small pro weighs lot hz refresh rate not widely available in thirdparty apps at launch battery life not up to the maxs standard the chipset is prone to heavy throttling under max load the fast charging isnt very fast ios with its limitations remains love it or leave it affair stars what in the what what
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,roentgen of battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,apple never advertised that they use machine learning for digital zoom the missing hat from more apple does use deep fusion when night mode is not used in low light conditions thats the case here apple definitely guesses new wrong details in this image look at the holes and the hat of the person also the leaves look extremely artificial thats not due to interpolation interpolation leads to blurry image when you use digital zoom traditional digital zoom would never show person without hat if the person actually wears hat instead it would produce blurry image where you cant really see whether the person wears hat or does not thats why traditional digital zoom is superior to machine learning zoom have pixel and it sometimes can produce similar issues due to machine learning the results can look terrible and can be worse than traditional digital zoom its crazy thought that smartphone cameras would get better and better so one doesnt need to buy camera from canon etc but such issues which didnt really exist few years ago will make it impossible to use smartphone cameras for responsible journalism and in the end one will have to buy camera from nikon canon etc if one doesnt want the camera to guess completely new details that are wrong and arent the result of interpolation
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,such great phone with stunning cameras upgraded from pro and expected minor difference more what theres virtually zero difference in image quality between pro and pro you can check the full res photos from gsmarena itself
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yeahyoure telling mei just returned an iphone pro after dayi have an iphone more you need real pro camera then not camera phone current flagship camera phone any brands is still having not perfect results as you wish
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the pro already has bunch of middling reviews out there its camera is very good but more yeahyoure telling mei just returned an iphone pro after dayi have an iphone and frankly there is omething about their pictures that just dont likethey look fucking uglyoki get it colors look natural buti dont knowthere is no details if you zoom juuust little bit it gets noisythere are no details in the foliage it is not nicei am sick and tired of these pictures frankly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ill buy iphone pro tb versions in next few months for me and my wife am so jealous lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,while can see some of apples typical oversharpening effect for daylight photos it more yeah they look samsungey when you zoom in on them not good look im surprised how bad it actually looks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so what if youre looking for highend phone that is also compact it turns out your options arent all that many depend on what you mean by highend
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ip rating
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,there is something wrong with the jpeg heic processing in the new pro pro max series it looks overprocessed which is normal in phone standards yet lacking in details seems like beta software
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,we can see the iphone mini battery life peeking out
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,oh that portrait feature for photos and videos are so painful to watch so many glitches even with all that tof huge yellow tint on selfie video still is decent upgrade compared to older iphones my friend is still rocking the abysmal iphone so this upgrade seems like reasonable one he likes the ios for some reason
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im disappointed by the battery life but this is what apple wants push buyers towards th more battery life is correlated to phone size the pro max has bigger body and therefore can use bigger battery which leads to greater battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,also look at the blue sign from the same image in the digital zoom image the person on the more thats what happens when you use mp sensor and try to extrapolate via algorithms to fill in the details get that apple is good at getting colours right but the details would still be lacking or even outright incorrect
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,techbuffs did video that show theres no difference between pro and nonpro battery life also pro max would be worth if apple made full use of the screen real estate and make onehanded use easier
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,laughable battery
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,as much as love this phone how the hell does it have star rating with that many cons
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,detail is no different than any of the mp cameras on the market its plenty yes most cameras today resolve lot of detail but cant believe there are no differences between them when it comes to how good they are at that
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,alright so the iphone battery life still sucks unless you get the pro max nearly hours of web browsing time and over hours of video playback time dont suck mate
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,also anyone knows if iphones have good or bad standby drain ive seen people praising more ive got the pro partner the non pro battery life in standby is about the same switching nearly doubled both phones from hours to hours on single charge with screen on time of about hours min
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the chipset is prone to heavy throttling under max load interesting they don more id say thats about right in line with the capacity of the pro max not sure why you are so surprised
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,they should make the pro max more narrow had that and the rog in my hands while back an more pro max is only criticized by media for its weight not its width mm when phone with similar width were bashed in the past
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,android has one handed mode ios doesnt that is not solution if the phone is physically too large the issue with rog of you have smaller hands is not even being able to hold the phone safe in hand same goes for iphone pro max series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,youve had the pro in for review since rd of october and that review is not yet up more the pro already has bunch of middling reviews out there its camera is very good but not great and the cameras are inconsistent the iphone is the better phone and the better buy and really lot more people care about the iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,expected batterylife to be way more better webbrowsing and video time than pro max its only the talk time that drops its overall battery rating
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,with this battery life belong to the garbage terrible phone next only pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the sixth lowlight image with digital zoom night mode off suffers from wrong detail more also look at the blue sign from the same image in the digital zoom image the person on the sign doesnt wear hat but in the tele image the person on the sign does wear hat its crazy what nonsense apples deep fusion produces it shows how dangerous machine learning is for photography
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,since iphone they have one handed mode stop lying am not talking about one handed mode on the keyboard am talking about the entire content of the display shrinking down for one handed mode the choice of how much it would shrink is only available on android on iphones especially the pro max model which is too wide the reachability mode on ios isnt as effective as we can only shrink the screen from top not from the sides with the one handed mode on android everything is accessible easily no matter how tall or wide the phone yet another implementation where android is more polished
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,almost perfect iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,well think the battery life still is very good and much better than in previous years the talk time is indeed lower but feel like thats less important nowadays the video and web tests are above the previous pro max pro vs promax and pro vs promax
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,any kind and generous helper to get me this is good to make content with it pleaseeeee
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,just recently yesterday my pro had whole green hue issue while running the phone in contr more what variant you are using
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bought nd hand pro last month done updates and so far have no issues dont believe more thank you for this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the pro is going to have better cameras and higher refresh rate display but no usbc and more the xs wont get any more version updates but still has around year of security updates left ending in surely the year newer and close to double in speed pro will get more than extra year over it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this or coming from an xs the pro is going to have better cameras and higher refresh rate display but no usbc and will stop getting major updates the will have the dynamic island usbc and should get updates until or but it will not have the hz display and worse cameras would say to get the pro if you want features the if you dont really care and are more after ios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im thinking of getting this phone buh im still considering the pro max and more you should get pro if you care about the refresh rate because the pro and pro max are the first iphones to have hz refresh rate if you dont want better refresh rate then recommend getting because it will get more updates and has newer soc
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,appleinc may iphone pro pro max if having issue with the white or greenish display issue you can ch more even if warranty is expired
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this or pro im coming from and want iphone but want to keep the hz more im using pro which im enjoying but will recommend pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,saw you on iphone xr stop crying baby just stop its alright your dyslexic and dont even have to ask
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this is the most glazed iphone of all time its pro phone with huge bezels gb ram only more saw you on iphone xr stop crying baby just stop its alright
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hey there am about to purchase new phone and have options onplus pro google pix more hi ive owned all three and oneplus is no go average camera average battery life and slow os updates not sure if its still getting any updates currently pixel pro this is still very capable phone great photos average videos and really like the design now the iphone pro still very capable as well better for video recording still very fast and probably still going to get couple more os updates for me if wanted the best phone for photos at great price pixel pro but if you prefer smaller phone with still very good photos and great videos then iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hi im planning to buy this phone since its at good price have been using and more yes you can install the google photos app on ios and have the cloud photos accessible on your iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hi everyone want to get this iphone pro but im scared of this green screen issues more had sudden yellow screen issue after using my iphone pro for year and half we did research before going to the customer service center and found out that and pro and promax series have this issue so we went to power mac customer service center and fortunately they had it repaired even my phone is out of warranty already they run several tests to determine the cause of the problem first then if the phone didnt passed that tests youll have to pay for the repair mine passed all the tests im confident that didnt dropped the phone nor soaked it to the water so they replaced the lcd for free
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,anyone install ios is it wort it or not not worth it all have it on my iphone the battery life is not so good but am guessing it because my battery health is down from to after updated the device something lot people have complained about ios your better off with the older os version this my opinion based on using ios but the bug in has been resolved
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,just found used gb version shattered rear glass for battery health around and more sell phones so know quite lot about this people tend to avoid broken phones but broken back is much less of an issue you can get it replaced for cheap price its hard to say how much you can charge for it without seeing the phone in person but the battery is gonna be deal breaker for lot of people you could try putting it at as starting price but dont go for less than ive seen iphone and even for that much
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone pro or iphone if you love the pcs stock rear camera hz pro motion display faster processor chip and looks premium design the iphone pro was the best choice for you but if you like the latest technology like dynamic island feature latest iphone non pro version design and doesnt needed the expansive pcs stock rear camera feature the iphone and plus was the best choice for you
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,nice love
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,updated ios and battery is much better now

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,always charge with the original charger from apple but my brother tried the hi copy charger on the device and he sees it working or not the charger so entered the battery and found that the last charge was day ago and the charger was burnt did this affect the battery in anything or the hardware of the device or does charging with highcopy charger once or twice harm the hardware or the device because then it happened that the device suddenly cut off the net and gps but the device restarted and then it became working normally and the device has never had this happen to it before its on ios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,love this phone its super amazing
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im bit confused either to buy iphone pro max or iphone pro actually battery bac more in my opinion iphone pro is better option if youre looking for good battery backup and if you need inches more screen size you should go for the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,had this phone for nearly year now and it is my favourite device ive ever owned ive got battery health but am easily getting days out of this phone with medium usage so battery is big plus the cameras are phenomenal and the phone is just blazing quick unlike the pro ive not had many people complain too much about this device or the problems they have had plus think dynamic island is overrated good for about month but gets old quick would advise people either wait for the or get any lineup phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,which ios version is good for pro latest version is good to go
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,like ios and the iphone ease of use compared with android which is me too offering it very expensive at and you could get an android phone for nokia is it really worth more probably not ps have both
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,its naff the camera creates horrible over sharpened hdr images the touch screen is too senst more have you owned this phone or are you just anti apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,definitely go for pro used yup solid advice the only advantage of the iphone base model is lower weight
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im confused between new iphone and an used iphone pro theyre both costing me the sa more just add some money and go for iphone pro

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hi guys has anyone of you experience having the selfie camera pretty much look like sht too much beautification and smoothness in the photo does anyone of you know the fix for this my first iphone but not good experience no problem for outdoor selfie and back camera bat for indoor espcially selfie
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,perhaps so but was asking because he has them both so is able to compare in the real world battery ultra wins camera except for telephoto pro wins though difference in main camera is minimal display ultra wins even in brightness performance ultra seems smoother with animations in ui than ios charging speed ultra wins hands down even with larger battery capacity security face id is more convenient compared to ultras facial recognition and fingerprint scanner battery life ios and is more efficient and barely drains when not in use unlike android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ultra because you can do lot more with android than ios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,samsung galaxy ultra is much superior compared to apple iphone pro give credit where more perhaps so but was asking because he has them both so is able to compare in the real world
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,given choice of one or the other would you choose the pro or ultra samsung galaxy ultra is much superior compared to apple iphone pro give credit where its due
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,got the pro yesterday to replace my as as backup phone this definitely has better batt more given choice of one or the other would you choose the pro or ultra
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,littledadi sep please guys suggest for me should choose iphone pro or iphone pro please any differe more in my case live outside the state the price after exchange is quite enormous my choice is pro cpu similar and upgradable bionic and in fact camera is better not huge leap from pro thats my humble opinion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,own pro max and it serves me great but im thinking about switching to pro more the battery life for me has been great charge my phone once every days and im getting comfortably hours and around left itll definitely weigh lot less than your ip pm and you can use this device one handed which is plus definitely an upgrade if you choose to buy this phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,please guys suggest for me should choose iphone pro or iphone pro please any difference or suggestions
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hours endurance rate is this joke my samsung has endurance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this phone compare to my previous phone ip is so much better the hz is blazing fast and feel like wont want to downgrade to hz after using this device display is ton better brighter and crisper the photos come out lot clearer and cleaner on this device as for battery life its not much different but only bit better and noticeable lastly love the alpine green colour and the feel of the phone it definitely feels premium however the price is bit on the high side but not by much would recommend to switch to this phone if the price matches your budget and needs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,are they going to discontinue this model once the is released yeah they will
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,have been using android phone for many years and am fed up of its camera so am thinking of more better wait few more days for the new iphone to be released then you will have wide range of models to choose from based on the features and price
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,updated my iphone for an alpine green iphone pro and it should arrive by friday im super excited as got fed up with the screen of the and it not being hd seen so many videos and read so many great reviews of this phone and having seen it in stores it looked and felt amazing learnt from my mistake and ordered screen protector not having another iphone screen scratched all over the place
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im puzzled which iphone to buy do go for iphone pro max or the iphone or more pro is better better screen battery and camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,but your edge design old design too
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,flat edges is still an old design big vcut on upper screen is minus on viewing area wakeup apple were on year but your brain still on the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,depends on what you like fast performance or telephoto or hz or all at once im bit worried about the screen size though because do have big hands
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im considering to get this in high school by the end of this year are there any other alternatives depends on what you like fast performance or telephoto or hz or all at once
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im still contemplating if should get an iphone or an iphone pro im curre more pro is good enough no need to dish out dollars on an incremental upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,who have this phone how is standby battery life have drain at night with every settings turn off think it is too much compared to my android phones had with max drain
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,tried to switch to iphone two times just for battery life but ios is so so limited back ge more
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hmm id probably say samsung or one of the google pixel phones although none are more am huge phone geek tho lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,when will apple start adding the pdaf feature on its iphone selfie camera iphone will likely have pdaf for its selfie camera and larger aperture meaning that it will capture more light vs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,no heating issues and am constantly on my phone dont game at all just regular usage really
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,anyone facing heating issue on iphone pro provide your reviews no heating issues and am constantly on my phone dont game at all just regular usage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,upgraded from my iphone to the pro max ended up returning it because it was way more omg did the exact same thing the pro max was way too heavy gave me wrist cramps and was wide as the atlantic ocean with case on it lol two hands was definitely must for it the way work two hands arent always doable that type of gymnastics is tiring sweet spot of the the pro is amazing one handed tricks are easy and very easy to do best size ever
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,got the pro just because dont want to large display pretty impressed with it so far waiting to go to the mountains and use some of the camera features
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,previous owner of the pro maxso heavy and clunky definitely two handed phone the weight was stupidsent it back got the pro heaven balance is beautiful and one handed use is superb highly recommend alpine green spectacular
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,what an amazing phone set in low power mode and can use this phone for days without charging think the problem of this phone is little bit heavy but the os is very good
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,have experience the bad out comes on camera of pro when take shot looks bright and gr more were you able to resolve this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,phone look goodcamara not look goodhuwei phone camara look very goods
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,lol sometimes its not about big battery mah the cpu battery consumption matters lot yes know that which person are you replying to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,about hours sot on mobile data and hours sot on wifi its not beast but for daily us more hours damn wish my samsung can pull that off lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so far so good
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,really really do love the iphone but cant help my natural preference for android an more if everyone was like you respecting other peoples opinions we would achieve world peace
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,jumped ship back to iphone this my first ever pro got fed up with all the updates on samsung sfe and the updates that are always late wish apple would use the iphone shape and this pro is big se
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,alright thanks just how good is the battery life will it be better than my pocophone pro more about hours sot on mobile data and hours sot on wifi its not beast but for daily use is just fine
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,you can expect good battery life smooth display and everything works just perfect ios is more alright thanks just how good is the battery life will it be better than my pocophone pro in day to day use know the iphone pro has very efficient processor but the pros processor is no slouch either and has bigger battery too
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so what can expect if bought one coming from pocophone pro im starting to disl more you can expect good battery life smooth display and everything works just perfect ios is little bit limited system but works great
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,why you use the term no other phone have you done your research dont speak on behalf iphone more and anyways those that lasts over hrs on vigorous activities are just so thick
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,really it was from mrwhosetheboss not from fake people it was battery test and the iphone pro max got hrs min on heavy usage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,deleted post really it was from mrwhosetheboss not from fake people
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,very bad design heavy weight not modern and ugly look as box shape only screen more seems youre in minority because people like flat screens of iphones personally hate rounded screen like all xiaomi or oneplus
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,thinking about upgrading my iphone and cant decide if should go for this or the pro max my phone currently has amazing battery and want something that can match it which do you guys think is best option
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,well actually it may be new phone but samsung has put out phones way better in many ways suc more stop defending samsung iphone pro lasted longer than samsung even with smaller battery capacity have you even used an iphone yet
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,is it just me or anyone too sees no much difference from previous iphone released and why has more the battery capacity doesnt really affect phones battery life the iphone pro has triumphed over the samsung which has mah battery
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,sheeeeeeeesh jan when the pro is grams heavier than the but has smaller battery like damn apple more battery capacity doesnt even really affect the battery life compare with iphone pro which one wins
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,deleted post ask yourself if you had done it first saw from battery test on youtube and the iphone pro max lasted hours on single charge with vigorous actions done on the phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,no other phone can survive hours ok only hrs at least iphone pro max why you use the term no other phone have you done your research dont speak on behalf iphone max if you havent tested other brand to be stating suck thing oh wait your iphone fanboy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,months used this phone great performance execellent camera but the mah batte more no other phone can survive hours ok only hrs at least iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,says an android fan boy exactly he has no proof or clue what he was saying at least the design is still premium in
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,its the best device ever with the perfect screen size nd battery life great display great cameras small notch am very satisfied with this device
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,excellent battery life yesterday have hours sot not bad at all great all round camera more hrs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,not had an iphone since no but thought about getting one again having had ipad pros but still not usb wake up apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,when the pro is grams heavier than the but has smaller battery like damn apple give your high end phones larger batteries the pro is fat enough for mah battery sheesh
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,mah simply means it can provide hour of ma power it does not mean how long it may more couldnt agree more very well said
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,cuz with apple evrything is more complicated and never simplefrom music to dongle to evrythi more from the home screen just swipe from left to right you would see the battery health or from top right corner slowly drag down you will see the battery percentage the notch had decreased the reason why
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,why my iphone pro max not show their battery percentage in widget also not show battery more cuz with apple evrything is more complicated and never simplefrom music to dongle to evrythingu need to dig more for simpler stufflike their overtly price for simple gig
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,youre not even making any sense sense of professional right great right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,oled aslo can make problem like that oled displays werent objectively bad display but its made by samsung
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,true right about their comment thanks youre not even making any sense
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,is part of the attention aware features if youre looking at the phone the ring volum more thanks lot for your quick response got it in fact was aware of it just forgot because using iphone after long gap deactivated the functionality
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,doubt your screen would blink because its oled and not lcd lcd also have this problem not only oled
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,seriously tho why there are bots on this forum true right about their comment thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bruh stop complaining the pro max had good battery life you cant compare it with androids had mah battery android which gave me around hours of screen on time while right now pro is giving me around hours of screen on time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,no drama its fact and take this note seriously tho why there are bots on this forum
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hai why my iphone pro screen blinking black white sreen when set the brightness can you more doubt your screen would blink because its oled and not lcd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ok drama queen hai why my iphone pro screen blinking black white sreen when set the brightness can you help me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,what they ask is true right good information and its fact at all like the professional thinking ok drama queen
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,noise cancellation problem
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,you can go with pro as the only difference between pro and pro max is the size of display more couldnt agree more
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ive managed to trade in my galaxy note and get this phone and it was hands down the more cool got the same setup currently sm note and switching to ip pro in few weeks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,true that ive been also thinking the same because of the screen size and the battery life me either skipped waiting for the lineup for the iphone pro max because of improvements to battery life imagevideo quality gpu hz display and modem
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,actually go for pro max even though its expensive ditched samsung for not giv more true that ive been also thinking the same because of the screen size and the battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,if buy pro gb variant is it good decision if you took lot of videos and pictures then go with the gb like bought pro max while ago since the end of
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,well did exactly this same was long time android user but ive decided do not want to wait any longer for ultra which will be huge and heavy but instead want to have normalsize flagship phone and ended up with an iphone pro size is perfect just too bad its only and not but its not big issue yeah its heavy but well build for sure do not have any problems with notifications have turned most of them anyway like ios ui smooth and fast battery is excellent im really surprised speakers wow do not like that do not have freedom on home screen and cant place widgets wherever want or add icons or thats it can use some rd party apps but its not the same like that you can stack few widgets in one also its very nice like siri suggestions im running every morning and siri is suggesting me on lock screen to launch strava this is cool dont like that without mac not everything is easy like you can easily import your bookmarks from edgechrome to safari safari itself on iphone is really nice bottom navi bar floating wideo window it sucks you cant migrate whatsapp just like that most of the apps look better on an iphone than android lol one more super cool thing is face id fingerprint never worked for me since im climbing face id is super useful and very fast can unlock every app with my face do not regret switching from android and think ill not come back at least not soon for sure just would love to have bigger screen too bad there is not ip ip pro and ip pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,moving from galaxy to this phone and now actualy no needed powerbank anymore lol can use this phone for near days in single charging very awesome battery life everything is smooth and perfect for me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,imagine on your gb phone you learn that this phone has capacity upto tb
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,moved to this phone after using the galaxy for years and it was the best decision ever more youre correct after using ultra for almost years now maybe going to iphone pro samsung has nothing new to offer on their latest sline phone no sd card no jack plug for what have to buy the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,galaxy and mi ultra have better battery life according to your tests
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,first time using iphone with this model after nearly decade using android windows phone wont say its smart choice but until now its perfect in everyday using good camera good mic recording cool design and really really smooth when touching however the esim is not quite good enough still has small delay and gets bit warm when using cellular network the phone also gets hot when charging with adapter
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,simply the best phone ever had top of the range iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,wonder if the pro will have an even bigger camera bump the camera is huge because its the same camera as the pro max which is much bigger phone so while it looks normal on the pro max itll look weird on the pro this is good thing tho because now you can save money by getting the pro without missing any features that are exclusive on the pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,got this phone after decade on androidsamsung started to use it parallel with su at first hated it but then it became my primary and the su is collecting dust
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,lol you do realize that the components were made by the same exact companies not just trash more spoke about my own experience different people can have different experiences depending on their own interests these are the qualities of iphone which liked most from iphone battery optimization camera speakers other than the above specifications nothing makes iphone better contender for midranges of other brands
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,should probably note that by jpeg meant for the compressed output coming out straight out more its fine most people do mistakes but this time im sure they wont ever make mistake truly believe that heif is still great compression than jpegs but still takes huge file size the more aperture gets larger the more light should let in the camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone default photo as heic format maybe when you export as jpeg it loses its quality more should probably note that by jpeg meant for the compressed output coming out straight out of the camera apologise for causing some confusion here shouldve called it heif instead to be more accurate
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,got one yesterday to replace my ageing nearlyyearold galaxy wasnt expecting more iphone default photo as heic format maybe when you export as jpeg it loses its quality heic format compression is so good compared to jpeg when you try to convert heic format to jpeg you get huge file size so to safe space and detail the converter did not export at same quality as original but casual users dont care just press the button take photo and airdrop everywhere most people use iphones so just airdrop for lossless quality to each other or the professional who just use pro software to mod the image
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,and what complaints you had with your brand new pro bet some people were having less iss more trust me the difference is literally night and day
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,my complaint is that the jpegs look smudgy but graininess has never been an issue on my brand more and what complaints you had with your brand new pro bet some people were having less issues with jpegs as it should use proraw but it wont make difference unless side by side
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,lol stop with the lies turn on night mode and this will do the job better if you hav more my complaint is that the jpegs look smudgy but graininess has never been an issue on my brand new pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,pictures are grainy was shocked when compared my new pro max photos to my older samsun more is that so cuz heard some people were facing no issues with this camera which is great sign but their complaints are pathetic to be honest theyve done good job with the main lens but the telephoto lens is still clear when zooming to in daylight mean vibrant in photographic styles still look great in many situations according to some people but why would they look grainy when some people never had issues with it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,zeeshanmazhari dec can you please explain what exactly are the problems with iphone pro cameras as want to more got one yesterday to replace my ageing nearlyyearold galaxy wasnt expecting lot from iphones image quality after all didnt really buy it for the camera but took dozens of photos to see what its capable of anyway here are my findings straight out of camera jpegs have lot of clarity boost and sharpening applied so edges look quite emphasised making it rather unsuitable for capturing natural objects apples tone mapping is also inconsistent so sometimes you get over the top bad hdr kind of photos while in other times ones that look so contrasty that all the colours are eliminated this applies to all of its lenses the main camera handles motion relatively well but the telephoto cant human faces have very nice skin tone though its worth noting that the colours quickly go wrong when you capture them when the sun is directly shining onto them in low light the camera tends to crush shadows for no reason much more so than my friends iphone pro on positive note this phone can easily stabilise the frame up to seconds using the night mode believe this is borderline impossible on most android phones including pixels probably except for vivos phones with gimbal ois the uwa camera is the worst when it comes to noise and details tiny sensor the widest field of view so makes sense then the telephoto and finally the main one proraw can be exceptional but comes with some caveats it offers an excellent dynamic range while keeping the noise at bay but the finest details will be smudged and thin lines blend together more often than not because of this proraw is indeed fantastic for moderate to extreme low light shots and not so much during the day my recommendation is to expose for highlights if you wish to use it in bright or high contrast environments as you cant recover highlights from proraw if they are completely blown out in the viewfinder tldr its good camera if youre into shooting and editing raw on phone jpeg sucks hard in many scenarios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so here you can get truly honest review was at that side looking for them and most unfort more can you please explain what exactly are the problems with iphone pro cameras as want to switch to it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,why is the camera so poor compared to my wifes ultra ultra available
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,if this is the best they could do for pro then dont bother switching from any mode more and it looks like third party repairs will be just as easy when they release the ios to stop the face id from failing after swapping the parts just because it isnt genuine enough
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,decide by which size you want and what storage you need honestly would recommend the pro max but really dont care what folks think about this phone being so big its really not that frustrating when it comes to weight and portability but like big phones because having same bigger display with hz is premium and it has so many benefits as well as the compact phones which is far from premium but cheaper
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im gonna upgrade my iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,apple is designing brick every year may be iphone pro max is brick weight under more do you actually think is heavy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ive just contacted sky network and they told me that need to pay gbp for me to swap my more once you have iphone stop buying for years unless broken save money for the following to improve your iphone experience apple watch notification on your wrist call on your wrist health monitoring music on the go apple pay on the go macbooks otp from your iphone auto tether continuity auto cut paste ipad takes call larger screen continuity auto tether media consumption home hub car headunit wireless carplay no need to even bring your phone out when you enter your car airpods best tws earphones auto switches between your idevices anc and you see each of the above products are top in its class android only have phones their tablets watches earphones android auto pc chromebook does not rival apples
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,well that is the reason why pointed it out here in order to get other peoples intelligent an more ive just contacted sky network and they told me that need to pay gbp for me to swap my iphone pro to any variant of iphone pro with new contract just walk on cex and just figure out that need to spend atleast for gb and for gb if want to swap my iphone pro to pro thnk will just wait for iphone pro by next year since to gbp is not much justifiable to spend just to get the extra features of the iphone pro besides that amount already can get very good midrange android phone with to hz of refresh rate and good range of snapdragon procie any thoughts will be appreciated thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,exactly the upgrades for the cameras are an excellent improvement from the pro mainly bec more no theyre not no regular iphone buyer will notice the upgrades that much unless you think the stabilization on the pro was absolutely horrible and you take videos while running all the time however yes its good they added it to all the iphones now
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,if iphone pro wasnt good enough for you why did you even buy it buying cheap phon more well that is the reason why pointed it out here in order to get other peoples intelligent and wise opinion since im on dilemna whether to upgarde because need it or jut want it and also to enlighten me if the that extra features on the pro which the pro doesnt have is justifiable for the money im going to spend besides spending from my hard earned money for this gadget is not an easy decision just only to satisfied your craving on the new ones and which sometimes you need other peoples opinion and advise
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bcoz bat capacity is not the only basis in buying phone smh lmao the pro maxs capacity is actually larger but it should stay at before depleting down to as apple claims that it should last years how high are you on right now
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,no name nov iphone battery is bigger than iphone prowhy buying pro pro and pro max are having hz display
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,thats right brother and if youre not gamer the hz doesnt matter considering ios is alrea more yes please do skip the pro and wait for the pro you will be thanking me as it will be big upgrade preferrably will have hole punch no notch
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bro what wa trying to say was that pro is not even that much of an upgrade the pro is more thats right brother and if youre not gamer the hz doesnt matter considering ios is already optimised as compared to android but what about the new camera features like the pro res and the focus ability which pro max doesnt have do you think its still better to stick to my pro and save the money for the upcoming iphone pro in the near future
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,actually the pro and pro max configurations are similarly priced even with the gb and more bro what wa trying to say was that pro is not even that much of an upgrade the pro is already good youre not going to get much if you buy it so you can save money
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bro are you just gonna spend money just to get high refresh rate keep your pro wai more actually the pro and pro max configurations are similarly priced even with the gb and which are similar compared to the storage options they were identical because apple likes to keep the same prices for their iphones though it might ok to buy the pro max and the not mini cause the bigger the better it always comes to personal preferences
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,id like to have good display for watching moviesmore pixels blue rays headphones jack and more like said xperia ii also has headphone jack and big bright display like xperia iii so think its better deal if you want to go with sony at all remember ii has hz display iii has hz but need to ask you how important are the cameras to you what about battery charging speed where do you like the fingerprint sensor do you need stereo speakers do you like heavy or big phones as iphone is pretty heavy while sony is light the reason why im asking you this is there are other phones such as samsung google pixel redmi note pro zenfone realme gt oppo reno that have all the stuff you just mentioned but they excel in different areas need to know more to help you decide
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,in spec samsung ultra is best from iphone pro but peapol buy iphone think it for show samsung ultra single core multi core sd or almost same iphone pro single core multicore iphone single core multicore cpu leave gpu for you to test so who have better specs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,got new cars with big touchscreen head units we dont have the same requirements but do you more do have car and thats how use my iphone in car via wireless carplay head unit and thats why am puzzled by your method iphone max fully configured is equal to an ipad mini an apple watch and or good car head unit allowing you to fully enjoy more of the apples ecosystem guess small company or you are just the employee of said company else why would you still bother to manage your stuff in car shouldnt you be in nice aircon room managing everyone and it make sense you would treasure mounted iphone compared to carplay because you need to use the companys transport app right whereby the carplay limited app does not work like uber drivers they cant mount their preferred head units and have to rely on their mobile phones large touch screen head unit and yet no wireless carplay feature top of the line cars all have such functions and last reason do not think its safe option to put phone in car it may get too hot in the summers sun and fire hazard
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,big touchscreen head unit someones compensating do you even own your car outright thats what thought
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,well youre obviously very inactive person with issues dont get so defensive just because more just because have issues doesnt mean im inactive im just normal person with issues
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,mount iphone in car why not buy car head unit and use wireless more got new cars with big touchscreen head units we dont have the same requirements but do you even have car own transport company so apologise for having professional needs thats all you can go back to playing with your phone now
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,please read pro max is useless as portable device im hoping the mini will have telephot more first of all dont ask for the mini its not gonna happen next year unless they change their minds second of all who cares it doesnt really bother me to have larger screen because the bigger is better third of all stfu
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,do you upvote ur own comments seems pretty suspicious the iphone xss camera from more have to agree about the poor xs camera the pro camera was huge upgrade even though much of the advantage came at the price of high iso noise the pro improves photo quality across the line with less noise but bigger aperture also decreases depth of field bokeh is often praised for its artistic effect but in real life it has more disadvantage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,still no split screen lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll ios had floating window for some time now for those who want to use it but like split screen its not very useful feature had the first modern smartphone with split screen the galaxy note and it was as useless then as it is now then year ago bought the biggest ipad pro because thought the big screen would be helpful in using multiwindow but was wrong again it was downright unpleasant its not something people use or need only few specreading young men want it because they can
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,am sticking with my pro and getting back in my bank really not much difference phot more was sold only with sim lock it wasnt till after iphone came out they released in simfree version that and the singletasking made nice looking but useless phone that in addition had poor signal when handheld and easy to break with all the primitive glass on it iphone had very poor lte band support no go too then came the first iphone that blew away the competition and since then they continued to dominate then its you who liked iphones back when they were weak and inferior and think pro is as good as it does not really make much sense
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,nobody said that the max is useless its meant for people who likes big phones cause the more please read pro max is useless as portable device im hoping the mini will have telephoto and promotion and preferably tb storage too but for now im doing finw with tb pro the bigger size over my mini is only barely resisting physical activity acceptable but the promax is well over the limit for useless as portable even for ft in person like myself
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,had pro and then promax the max is useless as portable you need to carry it in more nobody said that the max is useless its meant for people who likes big phones cause the bigger the better
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,recommend iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hi there im now ordering the iphone pro for dollars thats good price more depend if you want the hz and additional camera module
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,camera wise and notch both same on iphone pro and iphone pro max the big difference more they do actually but they are not really that different from the pro or pro max even though they have good benefits
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im not sure to get the iphone pro or the xperia iii what do you think iphone pro has better performance and battery life than xperia iii although not by much iphone also has arguably better camera image quality and video recording then again xperia has all the goodies micro sd card headphone jack notification led if you really like sony then the xperia iiiii is better deal than iii also it depends on your requirements too what do you need in phone as there are many other options
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,after getting many reviews still not sure either will go with pro or go with pro max more if youre used to big phones then go for the pro max it has some good benefits to consider dont care if its too heavy especially when youre coming from the pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,pro but the max has some good benefits for battery life performance camera and smaller more camera wise and notch both same on iphone pro and iphone pro max the big difference is screen size and battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,good phone better buy now if you need the stocks are going to be limited but if you are still holding on to iphone onwards you still can wait if phone not broken save up on ipad apple watch or buy an apple wireless carplay head unit for your car apple have good ecosystem of products all work well together the more you have the more value you see iphone is
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,all you need to do is wait for the next ios update know the auto switch to macro is disappointing but yeah it is what it is
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,anyone using tenorshare whatsapp transfer its legit any security concern etc
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,iphone xs camera would be way worse in night but during the day nornal person wouldn more so ur vandalizing somebody elses tv without their permission pretty sneaky if you ask me you cant just go around and using publicothers tv sets
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,you really dont have anything else to come up losing the argument again you need to more tried the battlefield beta is worse than battlefield and im more intro infranty combat rather than vehicles warfare so cod is my thing more fun more fast paced more people plat it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,aploe learn to write who bashes samsung dont care about samsung youre the in more you really dont have anything else to come up losing the argument again cant misstype when have text prediction disabled like bruh im going to move on you keep trashtalking me like if this was cod lobby
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,google making phones not google themselves have been in this website longer than you of more aploe learn to write who bashes samsung dont care about samsung youre the insecure one who goes to different apple topics and cry
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,if was upvoting myself this wasnt my state to have message upvote no one know more google making phones not google themselves have been in this website longer than you ofcouse would have more numbers also in your case since you stopped upvoting yourself you somehow started commenting everywhere where theres someone discussing about apole or even on nonapple related topics while mostly try to stay in topic but people like you come up wanting to bash samsung phones since they are having features you dont have atm
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,google and oneplus dont sell internationally almost no one knows about them in my coun more if was upvoting myself this wasnt my state to have message upvote no one knows about google in your country lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,forgot to say its funny that even google and oneplus needed to sell lowend and midrange more google and oneplus dont sell internationally almost no one knows about them in my country also you were the one upvoting yourself now you want to use that against me cuz you keep losing the argument
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,here it is the apple fan that always defends them no matter what guess what upvote my more forgot to say its funny that even google and oneplus needed to sell lowend and midrange phones to keep up lol dont forget to upvote yourself
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,forgot to say im arguring here because is funny seeing how desperate you guys get to bring up more still crying here and there you guys cry over apple since while your favorite company needs to sell phones to keep up httpsmgsmarenacomappleiphonereviewsphp look at the comments no one buys apple with feature rich nokia and motorola
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,people keep arguing against iphone in iphones own page if its bad phone why you more forgot to say im arguring here because is funny seeing how desperate you guys get to bring up downsides to the features use your iphones only got stuff that eventually android phones will surprass in year or less camera battery screen
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yes lol why you keep talking to someone so much insecure that he keep upvote himself here it is the apple fan that always defends them no matter what guess what upvote my own comments just so when someone points it out and you did got nothing to compared the phones to also have been talking about the iphone xs since the start never ever mentioned an android phone until apple fan brought that up so had to reply to his lies and nosense
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bro if you want to buy an iphone pro that means you probably have desktop computer or more used an for months still needed note so no it doesnt do what need though the can splitscreen apps which impressed me for gb budget phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,used an old iphone back in so its actually years anyways it was mainly to te more do you upvote ur own comments seems pretty suspicious the iphone xss camera from is miles worse than the iphone pro these days especially since the processing style has significantly changed dex is only useful when somebody else allows you to plug ur phone into monitoror if theres public monitor out there besides that why would you need it just use your desktop to type word documents
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yeah you used iphone from over years ago pretty reliable ngl dex will eventually more used an old iphone back in so its actually years anyways it was mainly to test the os rather than the hardware know the camera wouldnt be up the part and stuff now dex ofcouse would only run with builtin apps but whats wondeful about the internet nowadays is that theres web apps you can run simple verison of word and make documents from your phone in big screen using bluetooth keyboard and mouse already own powerful desktop where make my renders laptop is useless to me since dont move much but what if instead of carrying my laptop everywhere could just use my phone as computer always got it with me and specially can use the spen as mouse when not using dex is really convenient and no dont have ultra used to have note recently upgraded to note ultra iphones basically can only take photosvideos open social media apps and maybe pay for an app where you can edit videos but you got no spen to make precise clicksmovements and you cant use desktop environment either since it doesnt have one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bro said wouldnt argue with you but you keep making cheese up first did used more yeah you used iphone from over years ago pretty reliable ngl dex will eventually get little more useful but right now its only restricted to apps that you can run on your phones why use your phone to run desktop computer when you can just buy desktop computer to be desktop computer the desktop is more powerful btw oh unless ur on budget if thats so then you shouldnt have ultra
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,have you used an iphone cuz you only seem to hate on it all the time and yes know more bro said wouldnt argue with you but you keep making cheese up first did used iphones before an iphone and then plus expected the worst but it was even worse than though couldnt do thing compared to what can on android flossy carter prases dex and multitasking in almost every review of samsung phone since the note is very useful feature for him and for me aswell the other reviewers only focus on the most basic things on phone camera battery screen but what they miss is everything unique that the phone offers
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,they arent gimmicks they work perfectly youll have to wait more years they more work perfectly yeah on device that is like half the size of tablet youll totally have enough room totally
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,half gimmicks better app support you clearly never used samsung pho more have you used an iphone cuz you only seem to hate on it all the time and yes know these are gimmicks cuz not single reviewer is praising samsung for dex or multitasking youre the only one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,well noticed my ip pro has red tint on display has anyone run into the same problem
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,finally ditched android after being with them since the galaxy captivate best decision more cant agree with you morei was with iphone and then used android for like yrsi got tired of yr software updates then wait for cellphone carrier to update the phonenow im happy will get yr updates and solid made phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,facts the iphone cpu now has more cache than the stateofthe art desktop cpus that cost almost as much as the entire iphone itself just the four efficiency cores in the iphone are about as fast as the macbook pro the iphone gpu is faster than the iris plus in the fourport mbp
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,apple you are joke never had an iphone before but want to buy one only if us more so you want features you dont need massive battery what for with smaller battery it still lasts longer fingerprint is useless you never need it bc face id usbc useless too wowie one charger bc using two cables instead of one is massive hassle and makes me not want to buy phone and cannot carry two cables its too heavy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,oh yeah no split screen apps no rd party apps if you need those halfgimmicks buy the mi more they arent gimmicks they work perfectly youll have to wait more years theyll arrive on your iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,use samsung phones before it bad so bad sure got useless gimmicks like split screen or more bruh you dont need those gimmicks do use my phone as computer you use it as social media device use windows to make content you use macos to make documents
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this must be great the androiders are rarely this defensive and scared of new iphone think im going for the tb pro and if its as good as the droiders are hurt get the pro max later to replace the pro max as dash unit in my work car happy they are this cheap with so big storage buying one for my daughter too
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,why you followed me to this page now just to reply to my exact comment told you cameras more oh yeah no split screen apps no rd party apps if you need those halfgimmicks buy the mi ultra who needs to project their phone onto monitor its underpowered anyways plus can buy an actual desktop and get much better performance and much better app support
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,hey it is worth to upgrade huawei pro to iphone pro its actually worthy upgrade from iphone pro to huawei pro or the upcoming mate pro and also its worthy upgrade from iphone xs max or iphone to huawei mate pro or pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,literally the only thing worse compared to ultra is the zoom cam oh and maybe few ext more why you followed me to this page now just to reply to my exact comment told you cameras screen and battery isnt the only thing on smartphone can any iphone have splitscreen apps can any iphone run desktop environment or even cast the screen to tv can any iphone install rd party apps
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,is price no charger no head phone slow charging im not stupid am buying th more do your research then come back to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im having pro battery life diverted my mind towards pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this whole comment section is full of disgrace they literally just repeated the same thing that no one cares about if person spends on smartphone then let people buy the pro max if not person spends on smartphone then look elsewhere
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,this entire opinion section is just filled with iphone shills
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yeah but anyone who talks trash about this phone are the naysayers which is so cringe and un more agree
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,and im exactly buying iphone pro yeah but anyone who talks trash about this phone are the naysayers which is so cringe and unentertaining to an average person
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yes especially if you want to have smooth ios experience and im exactly buying iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the cable that came in my box is usbc cable what more do you need usb on one side lightning port on the other side
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,thank you everyone will buy the iphone pro as soon as can yes but bigger is better so think the pro should better deal not an apple fan but think it comes down to their preferences and their needs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,thats pretty cool and nice of you thank you
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,my cousin has an iphone pro while ive fe we both love our phones whenev more thats pretty cool and nice of you
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,can not believe this been waiting for one year just for this phone to come out only to more they want to maintain their products life on iphone because they only have series which are regular version se version which is so hard for them on the future to maintain the iphone regular series not se if they bring more new features on it as we can see galaxy note series are dead because there are so many series on samsung galaxy galaxy note fe with so many features that people already satisfied with the lower series assume they have no future reason for maintaining the note series since its almost the same of the galaxy series except for the pen that rumor said will came on ultra also agree on you such ashame this this iphone doesnt get any new exciting concept except hz display was hoping they can give us gb of ram also have waited so long for this series and skipped
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ddr or ddr
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,apple comment section is so toxic if people want to spend on smartphone let them be more agree huge time but to me apparently think the iphone pro looks absolutely excellent in my opinion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,would buy my trash chinese phone any time amoled with hz usb more ram more things more apple iphone is mainly for status symbol especially in developing countries and nothing else
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,you cant compare the pro vs the ultra instead compare it with the normal more literally the only thing worse compared to ultra is the zoom cam oh and maybe few extra minutes of battery what else samsung may have the larger sensor but its completly ruined by poor processing and oversaturation mrwhosetheboss proved that samesize sensor on an iphone is better than an equivalent sensor on samsung despite samsung having larger sensor iphones take much better night photoswith the same amount of time spent in night mode according to his battery tests the ultra scored min time while the iphone pro scored an min time so minutes of extra battery and extra zoom for more not deal for me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,oneplus is far better than apple apple is overpriced phone with no extraordinary featuren the more oneplus is definitely not better than apple theyre cheaper because they cut cost on their products its theyre still catching with iphone camera lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,its easy just pick one of those chinese trash phone lol me myself will keep my pro for more would buy my trash chinese phone any time amoled with hz usb more ram more things to do no stupid itunes limitations and many more and paid euro and you hahhaha for what for good camera maybe
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,considering either going for this pro or waiting for next years pro dont kn more depends how old your phone is if the iphone pro is drastic improvement say just go for it iphone pro wont have touch id either so you wont be missing out of major features if you simply skipped year and bought the iphone pro afterwards
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,great so theyll sell because they didnt meet your demands
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yeah smart people dont spend over for phone that is no different from the last more correct bro it doesnt make any sense to spend on phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,its not ah sorry again read as idk why read that
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,definitely iphone is intended for smart people yeah smart people dont spend over for phone that is no different from the last iphones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,bad phone not have any new futures my poco is better than ip pro max says someone whos never been in the same square meter with an iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,who is this one this is ending and youre still mentioning lagging which flagship more you should prolly stfu some android phones even flagships lag so the talk about it being means nothing there are still shit android flagships out there with subpar innovations and performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yh because its apple thats what what people do it smaller now know phone more iphones have face id tech not just single camera on the front which of android phones have
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,im thinking to buy iphone pro have been using android for so long my usage is now more short answer go for it long answer have been using both systems together for many years often we buy things base on what we thought it is however many perceptions towards are different from actual usage nowadays here are my personal preference or dont for comparison bear in mind that for the price charged should compare with flagship android you find that they are equivalent in terms of stability smoothness iphone easiest method to get usable photo for quick photo taking colours are natural however if you looking for high resolution photo for later reference then android is better however at mp you save storage space for daily usage you need to pay for more for best experience on subscription and apps sometime on things we take for granted in android but you have to pay in apple android is just have so much workaround but you pay with so much ads around fake emails auto generated is nice feature to unleash full potential of one device you need to have more apple devices fast charging on iphone is joke the list could go on in conclusion to say apple is wall garden is incorrect currently we only have two choices hence both are wall garden both system costs you much more than what you paid for one device either with cash or with your data in the end both system is holding ransom on the user with user data apps invested devices invested
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,so any reviews from people whove actually used this phone all ive read are rants more people here are trash talkers these days they spread false informations that are far from being true just because the pro max has hz ltpo display which was made by samsung
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,off topic here the aspect ratio is what is the here its not
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,video producer be like yey prores video and tb storage wait minute lightning usb seriously
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,purchased huwaei phones very bad performance and one year lasting onlyso buy good one more yes and you have paid probably something about dollars for all of them if they were so bad why did you go times for the same brand your comment is like many similar in here just pure lie im using samsung at them moment not brand loyalist anf for last two years with the same device had no single problem with it many of my friends have or had huawei and nothing but positive feedback this comment is not criticism of an iphone is about lies spread over internet over and over again by some individuals
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,are we still going to ignore tha fact that this phone has notch like its yh because its apple thats what what people do it smaller now know phone have under display cameras but people dont care because apple is apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,said marketing trick for not putting hz display in all series not about more even hz wouldve been nice but apple knows that it wont matter to most consumers of the mini who probably arent as tech savvy or who simply like to many other aspects of an ios device to want anything else android users are often excited by great strides not ios users
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,any news about always on display feature on this iphone pros not mentioned on the apple event
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,honestly apple almost does not have competition the only company which could threat apple wa more purchased huwaei phones very bad performance and one year lasting onlyso buy good one and use long time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,boring mmmmm
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,please people should just use their phones in peace and stop all these comparing apple and samsung choose the one you like and use you cant convince me to use the one youre using and probably cant convince you to use the one im using so whats the point
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,terrabyte storage wowwwwwww best storage hope you know youre going to dig deep into your pocket in order to afford that storage capacity
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,used an iphone first time few months ago would never go back to android again everything more who is this one this is ending and youre still mentioning lagging which flagship android or lets say samsung lags or you just mentioned lagging for talking sakes let it just be that youre making comparisons albeit lame one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,did not know iphone pro max beat all samsung phones when it came to battery life stay there and be deceiving yourself have you used all samsung phones to know which one has better battery apple is here ripping you people off by producing the same phone with different name for times in row and youre there comparing with samsung
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,battery
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,ooooh see that youve made correction to the ram section gb gb looked better especially since ipad pro can be configured with gb ram they should just release an ipad mini pro with just gbtb models with gb ram and better display they could make it limited edition if they want to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,you cant deny that the iphone pro and pro max are both excellent phones that no one more was hoping to get one when it released but will wait till apple is bit more compatible with connectivity like usb connector for starters if it jut came out with usb connector would still buy it is the standard that simple connector handles hdmi display port thunderbolt fast charging and more to come only good thing about apple is its security and built in apps do not have adverts popping up over things like weather forecast and others so when is the iphone coming out you woke up one your new laptops and windows customers are now buying them now wake up on your phones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,dont hesitate buy it because you are going to shoot excellent videos including cinemati more can get one and pay later
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,does iphone pro gb record video in the old format or it does not record at all more only prores video not available with gb but normal video and cinematic recording are available
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,gb ram not gb ram according to benchmark yeah an article just saw on imore confirms that gb for the and mini gb for pro series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,its not trick its real thing listen ai turns iphone display to when it nee more said marketing trick for not putting hz display in all series not about how hz display work lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,absolutely this phone make you social media star of course if you know how to shoot video and how to take photo
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,been using ultra thinking to buy ip pro small hands so think its better with its si more dont hesitate buy it because you are going to shoot excellent videos including cinematic you know telephoto is nothing to compare
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,dennisk sep hooe dont mean xperia hope
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,understand what you are talking but listen it looks same iphone doesnt lie customers more hooe dont mean xperia
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,deleted post used an iphone first time few months ago would never go back to android again everything just works no lags no app crashes no missed calls no dropped bluetooth
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,never been an iphone or apple person but the and seem like the type of phones more please buy and regret later
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,yeah go for xiaomi they will sell extremely pricy phone and they will sell for china with sa more where can buy legit xiaomi in canada
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,lmao what joke of phone had better specs on galaxy guess the sheep will buy anything have the was considering the mini or pro but pro doesnt have pink and mini doesnt have hz refresh rate and neither have touch id so might just pass and wait for the new samsung
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,the same problem happens every year nothing new only just adding some old features that others more understand what you are talking but listen it looks same iphone doesnt lie customers with gimmick mpx cameras look even sony uses mpx try to understand why its image sensor and software make job actually iphone doesnt need any further improvement on software its already customized and look camera become more light sensor display become more bright android phones yes they have lot things and same time there are lot of bloatware storage improved also is great thing you can swim with this phone under water isnt it great love iphone because it has excellent video possibilities you can shoot movie its simple like that wish could buy one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,you sure about the ram capacity of all iphone models
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,multitasking man its not notebook how you can work on small display by using multita more you judge phones quality by their included accesories ok lets compare it with my case then still have my year old note charger it charged many phones before and it still works fine have seen people using their apple chargers and the cable breaks very easily soo samsung apple lol back to multitasking smartphones can actually replace notebook if you never were able to do such thing you wouldnt know how useful it is look at people using widgets on iphone now when they were trash talking about them back when they android had them for years also iphones still dont have dex mode before you ask yes do use that feature thats why said phones can replace laptops
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,seriously though iphones and androids target different demographics why are we still arguing more well haters and fna exist to bring them into one osharmony os andriod ios or one company or one phone blag blah and the ios vs andriod argument is actually right since one os has to be right and no they dotn target different stuff either although each has its own pros and cons ultimately the one with less cons and more pros will have to be supirior
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,thought the rumor says it will come equip with aod portless low obit satlite connectivity more its mostly not released the satellite feature is for the iphone series according to very reliable iphone leaker and the aod is nothing special its almost available on every phone now its very common and in display ginger nah it still has face id most of this stuff is going or be in iphone which according to loads of romours will be an actuall upgrade instead of this one hwihc isnt much of an upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,battery capacity missing
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,what about hongkong version does it comes with dual physical som like models yes for almost the entire series except the mini
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,phone with lousy battery and super slow charger ridiculous obsolete
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,nobody uses zoom cam do though and wasnt even talking about cameras only they more multitasking man its not notebook how you can work on small display by using multitasking its not totally useless but its not great function think theres nothing wrong with lightning cable ps years ago bought earphone real iphone earphone it still works before that used android phones like samsung and others they didnt last long like iphone earphone so iphone has quality
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,nobody uses zoom camera speak for yourself do in fact use the telepho more there are lot of differences between telephoto and super zoom of please read before you answer think you got problem with your english
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,cappacity of battery only mah
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,great marketing trick with hz display only available in pro pro max make that more that is quite bummer having the ltpo adaptive screen on the mini variant would be super useful for battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,considering that this years pro and pro max now shares the same camera hardware unlike last years model and always prefer compact dimension this phone seems to looks like worthy buy but while this phone with gb internal storage costs exactly the same as the sony xperia iii its more than the samsung galaxy gb even if choose the gb variant still can save hmmm tough decision here since they all have their own advantage the iphone has great software life cycle while the galaxy has samsung dex and the sony has microsd card support and headphone jack alongside video output support
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,apple did amazing job this year as always simply love how theyre keeping the same design its showing how unique it looks hz bigger battery better display amazing cameras and amazing new sierra blue color just wow
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,how about issue feature low earth orbit leo satellite communication connectivity on iphone series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,notch so wide where is the battery mah mah
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,grams for the iphone pro thats over the edge
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,wow mpxl camera and improved nightmode and optical zoom great now iphone maybe is on more dont know why people on this site compare android and ios each phone is good specs dont tell the whole story every person will buy what heshe likes you can have great photos from mp camera vs not so great from or mp cameras and vice versa it is the sensor and software optimisation which matters here have seen android oems just focusing on specs with poor software optimizations
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,are you sure that the iphone pro and promax will have gb ram
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,what about ram type and management
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,glad to see both pro and pro max variant now shares the same camera hardware unlike the previ more making phone with smaller size doesnt necessarily mean it should cost less in fact its probably harder to fit all the components in smaller package it is only welcome that they produce flagship with the same features as the larger version
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,poor of innovation haha
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,what modem is this using still the or the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,those are some big ass cameras the camera square has even passed the center line
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,what about always on display
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,irl iphone is more useful ifans rlly dont know what ur saying ios is crappy junk wih more yeah go for xiaomi they will sell extremely pricy phone and they will sell for china with same specs but cheaper are you ready to spend for flagship phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,deleted post xiaomi mi ultra heats like oven because of snapdragon after while phone began to throttle if phones gets hot cpu may burn and its pricy only the camera left and in real life you will get excellent video with iphone pro and about max camera is just gimmick only thing change mobile photography is its image sensor
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,what happened to the qualcomm chip
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,dont compare iphone with and other android phones iphone is much much better in vid more irl iphone is more useful ifans rlly dont know what ur saying ios is crappy junk wiht literally no feature like the so called walled garden making it almost impossible to install third party app
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,deleted post do realize ur comparing xiaomi and apple by saying xiaomi blocked few devices in some regions and not the whole world
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,never had an iphone would gladly to buy one the main reasons love cinematography like to take videos rising prices of android devices xiaomi began to rule the mobile phone market and they are began to do whatever they want somebody should stop them this can be only iphone iphone never lied to their clients once go for iphone never come back to android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,why the charging speed is still too slow at only watt
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,and the lighting is out
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,feel that apple could literally not have any product reveal events nor advertise at all and still continue to sell their products the iphone could just suddenly appear in stores and all the apple fans would do the rest
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,where is it confirmed that this will have gb of ram
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro,oh no again we want to live with that notch hope now the sereis pricing will be reasonable in india

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well it wasnt like samsung has an inferior chip right for exynos isnt really an improvement while might be but updates wise is crippling it was hoping they could at least fix it with the let alone the fe or ultra but im seeing others facing issues with while some never had issues with it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,that is true it is comparable to geekbench think it is the only real cpu benchmark yo more well it wasnt like samsung has an inferior chip right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,same old recycled design the only things distinguishable is the notch and the colors more but why tho those designs are great but the only problem is that the cameras are raised up little bit more meaning it houses larger batteries but having the extra weight is well worth it so it shouldnt be problem anyways
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,look this fruit brand literally has trillions or hell even quadrillions of money but still cant patent for pop up selfie camera for no display altercations or privacy protection plus no chargers they wouldnt even make switch from lightning to usb this just shows how greedy apple is and apple better have cameras that have lot of detail in them for their next iphone that is being rumored that has mp main camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple really makes their customers suffer guess the only rich customers dont suffer more people buys foldable devices cause it folds but not having any innovation they do have the same megapixels smaller batteries and hz but that goes with the iphone pro series because displays were made by samsung ultra costs the same as the pro max or pro max which is good thing but it isnt really the case
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this device is very expensive yet it has no charger in the box apple doesnt even offer value for the money nowadays or dare even say it just years after steve jobs was gone do agree that the display is hella good but wow slow charging if you buy their expensive adapters even realme is offering on their sub devices dont think apple is even innovating theyre just farming for the money at this point
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,check out the benchmarks of the oneplus ultra mi and asus zenfone rog in their re more that is true it is comparable to geekbench think it is the only real cpu benchmark you know the blocked by google antutu is benchmark for everything so you wont know what is included in it or they wont tell you antutu is bad dxo is bad look at the score samsung is not even in top in dxo
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wondered how gsmarena was able to get the endurance rating of on this phone did they do it without the screen connected
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,probably because the regular are rated perfectly okay while the pro max is rated as exc more this is thing ive been wanting to say notice how all the flagships get the best ratings like oneplus pro got stars even though its got truckload of negatives same with iphone pro max stars even the worst pixel xl isnt even that bad at stars even though it had big forehead and bad battery compare that to the best of the midrangers redmi note pro nord and as getting tops think gsmarena just has preference towards big beefy flagships like they want more companies to make them
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,fold is the worst for gaming among all snapdragon devices even two year old snapdrago more yeah heard snapdragon phones are greater for sustained performance an added bonus their cheaper as well and with greater battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,sd is still falling far behind where on benchmarks coz dont see them fal more check out the benchmarks of the oneplus ultra mi and asus zenfone rog in their respective reviews in gsmarena all are lagging behind even the iphone except antutu mean if you play games for extended periods of time then guess iphone can throttle but oneplus has records of doing that too iphone is great for quick blast performance but do check out rog with fan for sustained load performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,in the beginning thought of upgrading from xs max to pro max model but it put me off fro more also its up to you to last the word but that doesnt actually mean that iphones are bad it still runs as quick as it was and dont really think that you should ever have issues with it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,calm down no one cares youre not the only one in the world buying an iphone you need to calm down bitter human being lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,preordered this today philippines cant wait haters gonna hate lol calm down no one cares youre not the only one in the world buying an iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,surprisingly vivo pro is given better battery rating than pro max even when max is better in all the battery categories that to with to hrs of improvement over vivo gsmarena can you please explain
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,max tech is the biggest apple biased channel on youtube their testing results are exact oppo more agree max tech is joke
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,stability on poco pro with plastic body is better expected more from apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well no you should the comparison video on the youtube channel max tech theres no com more max tech is the biggest apple biased channel on youtube their testing results are exact opposite of what other youtubers get
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ah here you are with ios never again and android authority why do you trash talkers keep more they didnt have any other point
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,but youll grow up soon and realise that you can do ohsomuch more on note ultra or more well no you should the comparison video on the youtube channel max tech theres no comparison iphone beats note ultra easily
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mate prop pro can actually record native noninterpolated fps slowmo video albeit more what even is interpolated
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the guy is troll always hating on anything related to xiaomi nah you cant swallow the fact xiaomi is starting to perform malpractice few already caught try harder
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no cam hardware is capable of this framerate as fake as the huawei that could do almost more mate prop pro can actually record native noninterpolated fps slowmo video albeit only at due to the fact that the sensor used for the uwa camera has binned resolution of mp and can read out each frame extremely fast however fps slowmo is interpolated of course
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,just cuz just post few comments and leave doenst mean that this isnt war by more so one second you think your at war the next you dont care about any of this now which is dude cause you are all over the place there that you think side has to be chosen at all says lot about your thoughts on the matter none of it complementary though
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,are you for real grow up have never seen either of those two get close to actually mak more just cuz just post few comments and leave doenst mean that this isnt war by war mena ifans and driodboys were always enemy and why do even care about our hate coment if ur gonna make reply like this whatever say boss dont give dmn about it and dont give dmn ahout wether care or not either
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,translated to cant buy it you are wrong actually dont want to buy brick
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,can list the few websites and its not like xiaomi is the onyl andriod company gaming more the guy is troll always hating on anything related to xiaomi
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,sensors with ms readout can do super slowmo now just shows you know nothing and believes more when you hold one in your hand youll realize how pathetic it your sony camera is
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its war you can to stop andriod authority ios nevet again and me from destroying yall more are you for real grow up have never seen either of those two get close to actually making point let alone destroying anyone the only thing that that come across loud and clear is how seriously they and perhaps you as well take your hatred of apple and believe me guys it comes across as tad obsessive mean war really
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,sorry but people are allowed an opinion thats unfortunate they couldve disabled the comment section just like macrumors and tomac
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,actually mm mp is more than enough but it has to do with photo processing exposure col more opps mean aperture size
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mm megapixels is not the right decision apple should have used wider field of view wi more actually mm mp is more than enough but it has to do with photo processing exposure colors and pixel size
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gsmarena if youre reading this ban these flip floppers they are so toxic sorry but people are allowed an opinion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,reading the verdict makes me wonder why this phone got almost stars doesnt make amy sense probably because the regular are rated perfectly okay while the pro max is rated as excellent the more stars stay at the better the reviews
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,look at sponge bob in test scene low light since iphone apple makes something terrible algorythms try to restore shape of objects and increase contrast previews look great but dont try to zoom it its kind of instagram camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,all the people bashing apple here by saying legionrog is better at gaming xiaomivivo for camera pixel for stable osi highly doubt that do you guys realise you are making the point in favour of apple an iphone does all of these things better than most in single device thats why people buy an iphone which just works as intended if you want proof see the ads run by these android companies focusing only on one feature instead of the phone as whole
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,your favorite xiaomi has also been caught benchmark cheating especially in antutu few tech si more can list the few websites and its not like xiaomi is the onyl andriod company gaming phones like the lenovo legion duel and the black shark pro etc destroy them in antutu and then blame qualcomm for making the sd raw perfomance slower than
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it cannot chinese phones do not record super slow motion it is just interpolated my mi ultra has fps super slow motion and its not interpolated several other phones even budgetmid range ones offer super slow motion stop lying about chinese brands hater
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,have to laugh whenever one of you try this triggered line whose the one that spends al more whose the one that spends all their time talking sht about brand they dont like again says the guy who makes it point to mercilessly defend apple in every article you cant even take legit constructive criticism of the minor kind kindly dont bother replying to my posts in the future
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,check the youtube channel of digital photography review they review cinematic mode it is way worse than thought too much sharpening it looks like upscaled to higher resolution the background seems the those effects from webcam complete horror red skin tones cinematic that does not have fps nor ratio lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the slow motion is proper fps at its not interpolated from fps even the im more it cannot chinese phones do not record super slow motion it is just interpolated
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,whats your cash app please make my dream come true also

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still have this phone its perfect but my wife has pro max and her battery health is like and my pro max still has battery health use the charging method so im giving her my pro max as just received my pro max she will appreciate how it performs feel like the jump from the pm to the pm was one of the most significant upgrades apple has made the phones look the same but whats different is under the hood the is heavier and takes better photos but the isnt bad at all and the display is much better since they finally added ltpo technology so the refresh rate can go down to hz to save battery it can also go up to hz which in contrast the pm still has hz standard refresh rate the pm also has significantly bigger battery and lasts lot longer it has higher peak brightness prores recording and higher optical zoom range also the allows you to also use esims at once unlike the where you can have esims but only use one at time this is important especially if youre traveler all in all feel like the pm still holds up well with the new pro models and if you still have the pm or older its worth the upgrade its still very fast and powerful
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still my daily driver in superb unit its been yrs

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,best phone apple has ever made no doubt highly debatable with iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,noticed that after every software update the battery percentage drops by dont un more check out camera on the samsung galaxy like apple however spouse has samsung galaxy and its so far progressed that you cannot even compare so much better
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yeah lol got beaten in test by oneplus device claiming the battery champion https more this is actually with the iphone pro max which is having mah battery capacity where in oneplus has mah battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,when using the phone battery also degrades its normal try not to update to the latest versi more and if you dont update then banking apps and other stuff wont work
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yup yeah lol got beaten in test by oneplus device claiming the battery champion httpsyoutubeijlmqkhpysincezxossxqnj
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,after update my pmax battery health increased to thanks apple im not heavy gamer only coc and efootball phone year old
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,cannot decide between this pro max and the pro max can someone give me some informati more its the same between iphone pro max and iphone pro max to be honest but in my opinion prefer iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,think for performance pm with the new chip dynamic and camera but for overall price and more definitely agree
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im planning to upgrade my iphone pro this month im contemplating between iphon more pro feelling rekax on you hand pro max more powerful battery life so choose what is more good for you
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ofc this is coming from someone who has their head shoved in the specs and does everything to more samsung galaxy utra is more powerful processor snapdragon gun gun is better that your pro max processor ok chark it on youtube ok
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its still good for few more years than that possibly thank you so much is it okay for me to change the battery to an apple service center right away is there negative effect to the phone if change the battery
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hii there am working in mobile phone company in uk we have all kind of phone series like apple and samsung if you want to know about mobile phone kindly reply me you name and phone number will get back to you as soon thank you we have ver goof prices for you if you also wana contract we will do that
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,really agree that the iphone pro max is the best device made by apple in my opinion but after upgrading to the ios that perception changed because the device overheated and the battery health decreased significantly even up to ios apple hasnt to fix it yet
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hate lot of apple products cuz of their fanboys always overrate them just imagine saying more for real they just speak without thinking
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,an amazing mobile phone experience what like the most about apple is they have longer shelf life so you dont have to buy the latest model and quite frankly very expensive for my country folk you can buy model that debuted or even years ago and it will still be able to get os upgrades for several years after the date of purchase my iphone got its last os upgrade last year my android phones from the same era are basically bricked as the old os stopped working long ago and they cant install recent versions of apps like chrome the runs safari and modern versions of chrome no problem tbe pro max is every but modern phone unlike androids from the same era that arent usable most middle range ones are actually already axed android phones are like disposable phones built to last only year or two at most
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,an amazing phone for influencers and content creators
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,best apple product have used bdw have used all iphones except the series but pro max is beast sleek asf
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the battery surprisingly holds well upto this day my moms phone is at battery health and it still lasts whole day heard apple uses lower quality battery in the series which causes it to degrade more faster dont know about the series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how on earth are you comparing an iphone pro max from with samsung ultra lol more ofc this is coming from someone who has their head shoved in the specs and does everything to ignore the actual user exprience the pro max beats the ugly impossible to hold rectangle in all aspects and whats funny the would last up to years without lagging while the would lag in less than years
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hello there everyone im an android fanatic but think should use an iphone this yea more you should
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,my ip pro max when updating to ios battery life drops ultra fast also battery health more dont know why ios kills the battery like that im really glad didnt update
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,year ago purchased iphone pro max gb have another phone so this is my secondary more this is what apple has to say another reason why your iphone battery is coming up short after the ios update is the apple photos app it periodically indexes your library to weed out duplicate photos and videos in the background and that process apple claims can initially take days depending on the amount of media youve on your iphone unfortunately theres no way for you to opt out of this but since apple says it requires your iphone to be locked and connected to power you can try keeping your iphone plugged in overnight to speed up the detection process and prevent it from draining your iphones battery when you need it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ios version on my device iphone pro max is cold and smooth without any problems but more this is done by apply if old phone works properly then who is going to buy now phone same thing happened with after that stopped buying apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,my ip pm after update to only moon bh drain yesterday leak ios than im update finish is ok but bh drain again after update and im restart my phone im everyday charger my phone with wireless oem and head charger pd after update im charger via wireless coming alarm charging was on hold due to iphone temperature help info with condision my phone

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,same here bud rn have the funds to aq uire ultra or pro max and still debating more how on earth are you comparing an iphone pro max from with samsung ultra lol ultra beats the pro max so there isnt any point comparing it to the pm which is worse in all aspects have both phones and btw by the price of ultra you can buy pro max pm is bucks cheaper
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,for durability go for iphone otherwise buy samsung my father still uses the iphone plus more samsung are durable too
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,need phone with high camera quality battery life and can stay with me for years cant more same here bud rn have the funds to aq uire ultra or pro max and still debating which one know there way more to them than the cameras but at that price point the camera quality matters more to me at least

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im using pro max bought in the first month since the release day running at batt health will skip the series and wait for series my pm still rock solid
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,question even if you follow the battery rule it will still degrade yes it will however it degrades at slower rate than usual
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont see how that is possible battery health after months usage question even if you follow the battery rule it will still degrade
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still thoroughly enjoying this amazing device battery life is great sitting at health aft more dont see how that is possible battery health after months usage

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive had this iphone pro max since new and its an awesome phone camerass brilliant vide more think you should wait for the since the is still really good and waiting for the might just be better worth upgrade than going to the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,samsung ultra always get the iphone and recommend you to wait for the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,frankly want to update to get more functionality for my airpods pro second generation but more is this joke or are you serious your battery level is that way it is whether you update or not the update may start showing lower in the settings menu but your battery health is what it is no matter what the shown is updating wont degrade the battery itll just start showing different which in itself is an approximation and something people take way too seriously
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you may try to update mine from battery health dropped to after few days frankly want to update to get more functionality for my airpods pro second generation but at the same time dont want to update because of the battery situation its tough choice
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you have good eye sight there you have the ability to measure the refresh ratei hope more
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive tested it on another phone and it still happens its cause of how the iphone more wow you are right when turn on screen recording my phone is way smoother lol im using it for more than year now and didnt know this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if apple have started making duplicates ion knowbut someone bought me an iphone pro more this has been on my mind whether or not one can still get new iphone pro max nowadays im not impressed with the iphone pro max it looks like ill have to wait for the iphone pro max instead
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the built quality is the main reason to love
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,do you all still experience whiteyellow screen issues in the iphone series yes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how much in average we should loose in battery health life in year and months usage more battery before you charge your phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,phone isnt very fluid for me the hz seems more like to my eyes you have good eye sight there you have the ability to measure the refresh ratei hope the company will hire you to test their refresh rate if it go beyond hz or below
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,does iphone pro max have bit display need someone with knowledge on this to answer this exactly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hi im using an iphone pro max all of sudden my phone screen become green more just claim your warranty
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you mean my fixed myself oneplus pro green screen without go to service closed som more sorry my apple pro max warrenty expaired on september im frm srilanka when call the shop they told nowadays lot of cases are commining regarding display isdues with out the display even cant be re start
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,oh no what ios version are you on and have you recently done complete reset mine feels su more ive tested it on another phone and it still happens its cause of how the iphones screen dials down the refresh rate which causes it to be at lot if you use the phone while screen recording it becomes full hz
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still loving mine battery life beats most of the latest flagships performance is beyond the more phone isnt very fluid for me the hz seems more like to my eyes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the camera only mp is so weak heavy weight dont like
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is still one of the best phones in wouldnt exchange it for any phone in the worl more completely agree best phone ever made
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it should not be less that after year mine is after months of use have mostly used samsungs charger but sometimes the original from apple never charged overnight and rarely to the battery health is not important and not accurate at all but in my case know why it is showing because of the fast charging with samsung charger the phone can draw that max charging speed and that must have caused some trouble with the calibration of the battery health my friend uses apple charger from his macbook and has health after year so it is normal and does not matter at all if know to know the state of your battery should go and check battery cycle count
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is it normal to have in battery life after only yeat of use it should not be less that after year
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,in terms of performance and hardware durability this phone is excellent in my opinion however hate the look of notch and cant really get used to it also the lightning cableport is outdated and slow in any case apple already uses usbc in some of their devices as well as thunderbolt so its time to upgrade to type at least thats not copying android in that aspect its just accepting better technology
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im just using this iphone pm and the battery was so really impressive really love it im moderate user and that full charge giving me more than day of battery life so worth having this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,do charge it until or do follow the rule using iphone from past months following rule and my battery health is
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,already in my whish list to buy but heard many complaints on black green white or purple more updated my iphone pro max to ios and my phone is working fine

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,disagree the reason why my iphone pro max battery health still at its because us more read before you post search before you post your question is probably already answered but my question is who took bite of that apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thought you bought the refurbished pro max then you took good care to the battery to no more now you know so keep my iphone pro max at battery health even my ipad air brand new with receipt still at battery health for almost year because usually plug in and charge the unit before the battery reaches
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats because you have the refurbished ones they could have inject the code to look like more disagree the reason why my iphone pro max battery health still at its because usually charge my phone regularly or at least twice day ensure that my battery did not reach below before charge my phone another thing bought my iphone pro max brand new with receipt not refurbished one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats fake mine still at battery health thats because you have the refurbished ones they could have inject the code to look like after you update the system would display the actual health

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,good thing apple removed fortnite the kids at my school had their average score increased by more then they would move to ultra for fortnite
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,please lower the price of your phone recently bought iphone for and the specs of it more sure the iphone is overpriced but when you actually use this phone then only will you understand
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,in how many countries is the asus rog phone sold in almost countries but selling rate is pretty much lower than other brands
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wish to get it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the reason is because the best android phones are the gaming phones there cameras have more believe you meant to say that nongaming phones lack active cooling measures since literally every smartphone comes with passive cooling measures
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,unfortunately epic lost apple won so no third party app store on iphones or ios or way more good thing apple removed fortnite the kids at my school had their average score increased by points fortnite is mid game anyways
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lol all mobile phone are the same you only need one smartphone company want that one with there deals
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if you see yourself watching lot of videosmovies on your phone then go with the iphone more go for iphone pro max better battery and excellent performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,now ik this is bit of silly question but can install fortnite on it unfortunately epic lost apple won so no third party app store on iphones or ios or way too play fortune feel very sorry for you your iphone is paper basically paper weight apple shouldnt be allowed too lock down phone like this it hurts the buyers of there products this is really unfair too the iphone users and people who are lock into the apple ecosystem and cant play fortune with there friends anymore your only way too be able to play fortune and be portable would be too get second phone that runs android too carry android phone that meets the system requirements too run fortune for example gaming smartphone that is built too you play games you like and is gamer friendly and flexible with freedom instead of having your favourite games taken away from you forever
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,disagree because the iphone is better phone for day to day use because it has battery that more the reason is because the best android phones are the gaming phones there cameras have capabilities big battery often with dual changing ports also plus software gives better control over there hardware the user can control the performance and clock speed of there chipset on gaming phones and builtin cooling system and fans allow for processor too stay cool and get maximum performance for longer the samsung xiaomi google pixel lack cooling and dont have enough ram there under powered and are unbalanced rather disappointing phones the asu rog pro phone has better battery life then the iphone pro max and snapdragon gen gb ram so the processor good compare the real best of the android would too the best of apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the lenovo legion or nubia red magic is better than any iphone compared iphones too more agreed sir
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,cameras no chipset for day to day doesnt need to be that powerful but for demanding ta more you must be delusional if you think gaming phone cameras even come close to the iphone pro maxs cameras ill always be on team android but the iphone pro max is perfect through and through
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,like you more like you problem
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,saw got someone selling original iphone pro max with just only eur on ebay with ex more are you serious
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its so simple buy iphone pro max buy android device samsung pixel more super
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,youre extremely dumb if you think se is same as pro max having the same chipset doesn more the lenovo legion or nubia red magic is better than any iphone compared iphones too budget android too level the playing field but best android phones are the gaming phones and there monsters lenovo legion has ssd storage plus ufs storage in raid gb ram snapdragon gen with cooling system with builtin dual fans inside the phone dual changing ports and hz screen nubia red magic with hz screen gb ram builtin fans good cooling system builtin gaming switch and gaming mode snapdragon gen android phones have google app store also can use many alternative app stores like uptodown aptoide apkpure also they can emulate many virtual android machines inside of themselves and you can have virtual android phones inside of your real phone you can even root the virtual phone or even custom rom gaming smartphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,xdo ranking hononr magic ultimate huawei probplus xiaomi ultra huawei mate more are you sniffing something that topic is completely different to what you just mentioned just move on
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bet if someone gave you this phone you will throw your android phone im android use more the same will nevet go back to android this iphone is perfect phone smooth fast great battery and most beautiful phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how to update to android for all phone and even apple products its so simple buy iphone pro max buy android device samsung pixel put them in microwave and turn to max wait hour you will have an iphone with android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the umidigi pro from or years ago the gb ram modal was on sale for more youre extremely dumb if you think se is same as pro max having the same chipset doesnt equal same experience with pro max pro max has way better design way better cameras way better battery way way better display and way better security face id now youre just bot who likes to troll people here so good luck with that that same pro max can beat all flagship androids out there and yes it is flagship liked it or not
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its useless to have gb ram if they have helio or unisoc chipset even android phone more the umidigi pro from or years ago the gb ram modal was on sale for pound cant remember exactly the price but it nearly want sub pound dont sadly it has mediatek hello at over pound iphone pro max is just scam its very unbalanced and barely even flagship without no meaningful improvement over the iphone se that has same very good chipset but with poor ram but at much more forgiveable price point the iphone pro max good flagship only better fashion phone and status symbol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,first time owning an iphone felt like the pro max is quite big and heavy the reason switched from android is because snapdragon onwards is making their phone heat up so badly even for simple video and web browsing while the iphone stayed cool great news is the battery life is really great and is comparable to android kk mah always wonder how is it like to own an iphone seeing everyone around you has it but it seems to me there is nothing to it can still live with android tho
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,awful overpriced bullshit product for poor losers like you
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,back camera is not good always shaking turn to blurd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,know iphone have better processor since until now my iphone had been performing the same unlike to those gb ram snapdrag phones used to have which is the flagship that time is performing very poorly now and we can see the quality just right there but still think apple phones way overpriced there phones now that have better performances and camera and is more less the price of this pro max if wanna buy pro max stay with that phone for the next years
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,looking for phone with flash player radio and antenna get some ancient feature phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,only gb ram and this cost flagship price should of at least had gb apple ram is not even more its useless to have gb ram if they have helio or unisoc chipset even android phone with gb gb or even gb cant even beat this iphone you believe in ram size not chipset and everything
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont laugh but im totally old school having iphone which know will not be more if you want to save bit of money you can opt for the old model like iphone series or maybe series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone always give software update even my old iphone plus upgradable to ios more dont laugh but im totally old school having iphone which know will not be supported by the end of the year that would be why ended up here so see the comments on the current iphones do not want to spend lot of money but based on the comments if want decent iphone need to go with pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,get one yourself and see how it works id like to see you try bet if someone gave you this phone you will throw your android phone im android user for years and just switched to this iphonepmax no regrets at all will never go back to android after using this phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive been an android user for lifetime mostly entry level and midrange this is my first flagship and my first iphone ever frustated between the pro max it seems too big while the pro is quite small went with the pro max and no regret at all extraordinary battery life with exceptional camera charging with watts took me hours its fine tho so im not glued to my phone it kinda feel heavy at first but you get used to it happy with my purchase
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,eww iphone se has same processor as the most expensive iphone no reason pay more value for money you should focus on apple products are not good anyway so dont over pay for them or be willing to pay lot for them
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lol my brother that gb ram you talking about is much more better than samsung gb ram or wet more do you think samsung galaxy ram is the same as infnixe pho ne ram or itel ram se samsung performance is far better than iphone performance go for youtube an see for yourself

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the best iphone is the se same chipset just use power bank for extra battery and fan more eww
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,idk why anyone would buy an iphone it is too expensive and it is worse than samsung galaxy more because it is just after years while scamsung plus was literally mid range phone after year battery was ok but if was super laggy compared to my iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hehehei agree with your opinion friendvery sorry to buy but the charger is not supported more the charger is not supported in ultra eather

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,my first flagship phone my mom buy this phone at verizon florida
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dirty ugly design and camera hole super heavy iphone never matched with big screen jobs was right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,was midrange phone while this is flagship mobile exactly comparing euro phone with euro one makes no sense also have an iphone pro max and am very happy with it but comparing it to phone times cheaper makes no sense
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is it too big and heavy compared to huawei mate lite im considering replacing my mat more itll be bigger and heavier for sure but the phones not as heavy as many make it out to be is not heavy at all for phone imo
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its not lcd its an hz oled screen and the flat edges around the metal rails are sign more they use the notch for the face id tech which is much better than androids face unlock
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothings change the flat design edges is like an old school phone and the big vcut shape on more its not lcd its an hz oled screen and the flat edges around the metal rails are sign that it is premium
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the honor has an even higher screentobody ratio than the pro max lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wow an iphone that can last two days put this thing in museum with the combination of the more two days haha sot try again
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,but need to spend for separate charger is simply not acceptable and there is also no fast more hehehei agree with your opinion friendvery sorry to buy but the charger is not supported liberomania
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im android freak and know iphone pro max have the best battery in no phone is bet more but need to spend for separate charger is simply not acceptable and there is also no fast charger included for the previous generation as well whats for with very long battery life if you cannot charge the phone fast know there is plenty of compatible adapter out there but please dont use the environmental saving reason as the poor excuse to not include fast charger stingy apple for the wrong mindset of user
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats how companies get you to buy the latest phones tbf well remember paid the same amount of money to get ultra but since the androidoneui it just doesnt deliver as it should with iphone youre usually troublefree
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,can you transfer files to another laptopandroidetc via bluetooth or there are still secutity reasons
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,heres in america ppl dont care about big notch or small notch ppl yeah no they do unless youre from south america then im sorry
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,would like it for free
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,coming from lifetime android user here my experience with the pro max has been truly magnificent many things about the iphone is just so well built and finding the flaws was almost an impossible thing to do obviously coming from an android there are definitely things that would say that android is better at like the godly customisation that you can do you dont get that with the iphone but the one reason why decided to grab the iphone is because of battery needed phone where the battery could last long enough like hours screen usage is fine as long as the battery can last the whole day with the iphone the battery can last more than day sometimes even days with long screen usage that alone already made my experience with the iphone truly amazing one other than that performance is terrific cameras great hz is consistent as hell and can finally play genshin impact without any lag
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wont happier to see this new horrific trend seen final end including mm headphone jack which make others unpleasurable and disturbing forever when listening music without headphone jack
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what you mean by weeks iphone pro max can survive for hours easily with moderate more wow an iphone that can last two days put this thing in museum with the combination of the powerful bionic chipset and this battery life tiktok and instagram scrolling are going to be the best theyve ever been for becky and marques
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,have sony xz which came out in its great phone pretty quick and all that but lags sometimes and gets very hot have been thinking of getting new phone and am considering apple and android have budget of for second hand phone can anyone give me any recommendations
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hope the battery life stays the same with later ios updates have faith in apples more if it dont then dont do the update problem solved
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what holding me back is the battery apple seriously need to up their battery game iphone use more im android freak and know iphone pro max have the best battery in no phone is better its not only about mah its also about optimation
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,had accident and lost my pinhole pro max and the thieve was able to remove or turn off more for all the things that never happened this never happened the most
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,could add up dimentionsize info about the camera protrusion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if apple ever releases an iphone with mah battery they have to optimize it to make it la more what you mean by weeks iphone pro max can survive for hours easily with moderate usage with single charge thats almost days do you really need phone to last beyond this numbers
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it took them years to get to mah battery might take them another years to reach more if apple ever releases an iphone with mah battery they have to optimize it to make it last for weeks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,depends whats more important for you iphone will have better battery life video reco more bought the ultrabut am not satisfied with the battery life with the size of batteryit make me feel sad that lose the sd card feature but still battery life sucks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ill buy this phone in why to long time its cheap right better you buy latest of the best
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,people buy an iphone not because it is the best im sure there will be tonnes of phone out the more recently moved away from pro to pro max and understand the smoothness of ios and the monster performance of truly unbeatable not big fan of eco system as only wanted simple life at home however pro max battery life is truly outstanding and outperforms in gaming
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this message is specifically for iphone fans and iphone lovers oppo find pro pro more people buy an iphone not because it is the best im sure there will be tonnes of phone out there better than iphone however people buy iphone because of its simplicity seemless integration in between apple devices from iphone to ipad to macbook etc guys look up to fortune companies am pretty sure apple is among top in the world fact
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple iphone is the king of all phones in the world especially material usedcamera quality an more samsung has better cameras so does google and other android phones like mi ultra got better materials apples strength comes in form of optimisation battery life video and sustained performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you people stop hiding facts iphone pro max is the king of the junglethis phone can withs more least blind apple fanboy up to efficiency source trust me bro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bro feel you like crazy much have the ultra thought its the best phone more thats how companies get you to buy the latest phones tbf
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,after using android for my whole life the recent stuff from android has been kindalacklus more bro feel you like crazy much have the ultra thought its the best phone ever had until android came in made the experience worse started having stutters and lags that didnt have one ui had still has issues where things tip is when got stuck in bootloop changed my samsung account email think this triggered it had to hard reset lost stuff photos etc and had to set it up like new phone exactly month later got stuck in bootloop again this time software update triggered it updated restarted entered my password and boom im now looking forward to iphone pro max itll be better to get used to that and have mostly problemfree phone that performs perfectly in every app or gesture than having to deal with yet another android problem every now and then always loved android and all the new cool camera specs that come along but if we think clearer apple knows what they do what not its less customizable but dont customize since years keep stock icons colors less crazy camera specs but everything just works no gimmicks no focus issues like ultra etc it seems their ui is more sophisticated than the android mess
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well the biten apple officially joined the ram race it once trolled where are dem more its an oled and its just retina specific ppi liquid retina are the liquidcd displays indeed which this one doesnt have
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the tb version is an expensive joke please save more and buy the samsung galaxy fold no reason to get an expensive phone thats unbearably heavy thick and has plastic screen that will need replacement in year or so personal opinion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,just weak in life stress test same with series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bro my own samsung note ultra dont get hanging the phone is very fast so don more im guessing you have the snapdragon which was way better than we got here on our country we had the weaker and crappier exynos version thats why it sucked so much im happy with the switch to iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hmm in my case regret buying samsung phone had choice back then to go for either th more bro my own samsung note ultra dont get hanging the phone is very fast so dont know what you are toking about be you by fake samsung notes ultra
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple iphone worth more than its price chargesexcellent cameras and above all night vison mod more apple iphone is the king of all phones in the world especially material usedcamera quality and efficiency are all excellentexcept battery life and durability since iphones are mostly sealed and not easy to replaceiphone engineers are not common so when the phone has some problem customer must dump it because no one is allowed to service the phone without permison from apple compony
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,are you surw your name location and whatsapp number apple iphone worth more than its price chargesexcellent cameras and above all night vison mode but it would be much better if they improve on battery life and its durability because its not easy to repaire and replace most customers dumps the phone when its battery gets spoile
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,think iphone pro max is the perfect embodiment of what we know of concept called technology and the apocalypse
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats the most hilarious contradiction ive ever heard apple products are the ones more apple products are the ones that last longer than androids thats the most hilarious contradiction ever heard
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,think youve confused iphones with android phones for this one thats literally more are you surw your name location and whatsapp number
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hello is this phone have screen of or millions colors and why gsmarena doesnt more apple uses bit panels
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the main issue is that when you use apple the phone becomes outdated every year android more think youve confused iphones with android phones for this one thats literally how ever single android phone maker operates it was especially bad years ago where they always left you hanging on old android version just when google released something cool pressure from apple and its almost legendary years of software updates made some of android phone makers care bit more about existing devices and deliver updates for it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not true just upgraded from an iphone that have been using for the last years and it more thats the most hilarious contradiction ive ever heard apple products are the ones that last longer than androids the notch of the iphone looks perfectly normal versus the and while people with current generation samsungs immediately assume my pro is kinda old due to its waterdrop notch which is kinda true the phone is obsolete compared to newer androids even if still love it very much the screen is very dated hz and the brightness is also lacking it barely edges nits the camera is just okay now although it still impresses people with its zoom not many people here have an ss ultra here and the market is dominated by apple here as for the iphone youve got itll definitely look slightly dated however it isnt totally obsolete and people wont completely disregard it as apple still sells an iphone se
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,got it for nd wk right now im transitioning to ios from android yeah ios is not as flexible as android but ios is so fluid and most of the apps works so perfectly yes it is pricey some will say im stupid coz bought this expensive phonewhich for me its okay price
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no yestrue what they say
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hmm looks great like this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this phone helped me locate my lost cat thank you iphone if you use with android more better and easy find your cat smooth to find it you also thanks much with android right thanks

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,my iphone pro max is arriving shortly should cancel and wait for phone series wait for the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wondering if you guys think that this could be contender for the phone of the year or maybe ultra will top that well it is still very early were still waiting for the mi ultra and more but am interested in your guys thoughts
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,android has no innovation right you will have to suffer for your life right thsnx im happy with you you already suffer right thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,but now android already beat ios right thats true right thanks android has no innovation right you will have to suffer for your life right thsnx

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im currently using an iphone pro and wanna upgrade to the series please need yo more if you are not satisfied with iphone pro battery then upgrade to pro you will not regret it best battery iphones are the series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agree with you samsung ultra is the best phone money can buy no competition whatsoever true
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the apple has removed the noise cancellation option in whole series lineup google it and more but still no one can beat apple lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,galaxy ultra remain the best phone for mow forget the iphone scam some people may buy more fantastic camera more like overprocessed image that thinks its real mp when the sensor are like megapixels
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,android almost the best and the smooth at all true right thanks iphone better and ios better optimization right thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,good day apple am using an iphone pro max dont know if this is just an isolated case more the apple has removed the noise cancellation option in whole series lineup google it and youll get the answer boi the apple has started cheating their customers and have started doing business just to promote the sales on their most expensive shitty airpods people will start buuying airpods for the sake of noise cancellation
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agreed was using pro before and then switched to su on th april thinking it more had the note note ultra fold the battery life and optimizationsmoothness is league of its own on the iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,heyhows battery life ios have pro maxshould stay on or update to more thats true personally esperienced it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,your joking right he didnt he was tired of seeing chinese companies rebranding the same phone with another name so he buys iphone to forget those
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple told you that ios dont need much because its well optimised but gradually the are more haha samsung gb ram in your dreams who needs alot of ram lmaoooo also mp is useless anyway loool how apple brainwashes people when they bought one they just want to experience the os not the ram loool ram doesnt do any difference
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thanks our dear customers apple will be welcomeing iphone propro max or maybe iphone flip more good day apple am using an iphone pro max dont know if this is just an isolated case or issue but it seems like the phones microphone is not well optimized its like too much loudness here from the person you are talking to which is absolutely annoying ear irritating too much noise it seems even if the surrounding is not noisy tried using an android phone did vid calling thru messenger can say voice was really clear so it only means the problem is the iphone specially when using headset apple headset too much irritating noise will hear hope there will be software update to fix this issue or bug
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont compare phones with different price ranges my experience with noth my old note ultra and pro max literally get solid hrs sot but with the note ultra is hrs when turn on battery saver its definitely hrs period
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,have just booked pro max should wait for series wait for iphone pro series if you want notch less display punch hole pill shape mp main shooter improved front facing camera auto focus bigger battery of course bionic
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive also being an android user all my lifeive never used iphone but now im more yes would recommend have been diehard android fan for years owned all htc and samsung flagships each year have moved to iphone last month and am amazed at battery life and how convenient features are and how optimized and quick apps are there is no gimmick with zoom and megapixel camera its just an iphone phone and it does an extremely good job at it bootup and in seconds you can start using apps quicker than my samsung flagship battery lasts me days samsung was always plugged into charger
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,came from xiaomi mi and upgrade to pro max best phone have ever had
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,android more function and smooth right thanks iphone is better
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the gb ram multitask better ultra is better you cant compare iphones more exactly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes gb is enough for iphone because phone doesnt support multitasking like android android have mah and iphone have mah battery on papers battery is good but in real life test iphone mah battery wins by huge margin similarly the results for multitasking too
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gega ram android gega ram iphone yes gb is enough for iphone because phone doesnt support multitasking like android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not all flagships cost over usd mi ultra the phone that use for example costs more haha miui full of bugs lmao
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no need just buy latest samsung is the better as they are bored with the experience they want an iphone instead so stop talking about your android fetish
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes the gb ram multitask better ultra is better
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its good but it has low ram mean itd gb while sumsung its gb lol my brother that gb ram you talking about is much more better than samsung gb ram or wetin you call am okay
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,compared to samsung ultra this phone is nothing in terms of display or camera its joke more pro automatically wins for having flat display no discoloration down the sides or glare from light
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,as an adroid user my whole life switching to iphone pro max feels little bit awkward to more ive also being an android user all my lifeive never used iphone but now im thinking of switching to iphone from samsung would you recommend pro max to firsttime iphone user
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so smart people dont buy flagships ok lol not all flagships cost over usd mi ultra the phone that use for example costs around usd in my country
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yesits absolutely true and trusted right also iphone user admit it android smooth tell me if you dont have an iphone youre just bashing against people and vandalizing usernames and talking about android is smooth even though they are bad in optimization
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,android high in stability processing right perfomance make all happy with android are you insane
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,camera is the best for both taking photos or videos good to hear ill buy an iphone next year
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,regretted switching my ultra to this phone it feels far less snappy than the ultra more hmm in my case regret buying samsung phone had choice back then to go for either the iphone pro max or the samsung note ultra got the noteultra with gb ramgb rom and you know what even with that much ram is lags throttles the phone which results in overheating and battery life is the worst to hours sot when got the iphone pro max for my birthday was shock on how it handled all task did on my nu and the best part battery life has been the best on this phone around to hours sot never again gonna buy samsung phones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hows the camera the specs looks really good though camera is the best for both taking photos or videos

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,when am been using around three months already so am loving it its so amazing especially the battery

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,from denmark why my iphone pro max unable to save image after capture the image why yes same with my iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,even gb ram laptop also not enough free ram space to use first apple does not make customer specific products second why would any company not only apple bother making phone just for you person on this planet then even if you get one you will quickly realize how useless that devices biggest feature really is
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,can apple make gb ram smartphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its more of software phone since alot of the specs seem bad but use it and you will forget the specs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,miss the times of flagship killers having same flagship chipset as that phone in devic more poco xiaomi and galaxy as let me introduce ourselves
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the best among the mobile phones today excellent screen outstanding camera best software support and above all amazing battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why cant my iphone make process for photoshop software while he has gb of ram my standard with gb works fine with adobe photoshop and lightroom make sure you are allowing full access to photos via the adobe app
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,cause its kool to hate apple also preach its good to be familiarized with bot more sorry but your friends sound simple if that freaks them out
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,except its beating all the competition with just gb of ram stop obsesing over meaningl more well said absolutely right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,do you pay that amount of hard earned money to have nice camera quality in your phone if more miss the times of flagship killers having same flagship chipset as that phone in device that costs was pretty damn cool the rest of stuff like displays and cameras often werent that worse and you could get really good value for money nowadays flagship killers are basically gone and everyone wants to charge obscene prices for rather mediocre specs while all flagships are now with well over digit prices which is just insane especially low end and mid end is really bad at the moment bunch of cheap devices plagued by crappy chipsets like snapdragon or even mediatek and series which should be gone entirely already
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,tiny ram space dont know what apple doing cannot catch up the technology except its beating all the competition with just gb of ram stop obsesing over meaningless big numbers just because they are big ios is super optimized to work with iphones hardware and it shows apples chipsets have less cores yet they beat all the ones in android phones it has less ram yet still manages to run everything smoothly has smallest batteries yet pulls one of longest battery endurance times its not in this number is bigger than that one there are things beyond just those numbers that matter and apple is exceptional showcase of that but people here on gsmarena more often than not just look at how big the specs numbers are they look at the price and declare iphones weak and overpriced yet they are anything but that they are hyper optimized and squeeze insane performance out of lower specs on paper and manage to beat most android flagships with ease and retain that title often for one whole generation ahead of the rest
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,should stop flexing bet dont even have that gb ram smartphone tiny ram space dont know what apple doing cannot catch up the technology
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why iphone pro max excluded charger in the box why iphone pro max excluded mm jack more cause its kool to hate apple also preach its good to be familiarized with both oses freak out my friends when help them with their android devices they always have to remind me that have an iphone and tell them yeah and
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,go whine to your petty facts bet no one cares about your opinion they just wanted phone more do you pay that amount of hard earned money to have nice camera quality in your phone if so thats your personal choice but believe that flagship phonesnowadays are overpriced for no compelling reason to pay that huge sum of money everyone of us know the basic functions of phone and there are lots of budget friendly phones which can satisfy your daily requirements and some even may go beyond your expectations
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,need at least gb ram should stop flexing bet dont even have that gb ram smartphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gb ram only enough to open about app to less for laptop need at least gb ram what the hell are comparing an smartphone with way more expensive high spec computer
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gb to smallest that why the apps running so slow what do mean iphone is one of the fastest phones can buy on the market
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this thing could even last days without charging it so can my
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lol gb is more than enough ios is actually more optimized than android was gb to smallest that why the apps running so slow
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hate this silly notch looks ugly the comment true right thank you so perfect
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,best phone up to date but still have camera zoom problem right thanks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you think ios isnt considered as optimized you must be weak af then yesabsolutely not
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no not true you think ios isnt considered as optimized you must be weak af then
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,phone for over inr with weight like brick people now days forget meaning of phon more you think is brick you must be weak asf then
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes of course seriously
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes the latest ios more issue and component issue absolutely true yes of course
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,as lifetime android user this phone almost swayed me im just not fan of ios but thats just me the design is gorgeous and the cameras great the only thing wouldve liked to see is maybe gb of ram then it would be monster with how well optimised ios is
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agreed totally phone over is useless yes true
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,samsungi am joke to you samsung think samsung to fight huawei alone lost far not to mention against other android phones dont fanboi your thoughts lead you to stupidity
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why my phone become slow you just want to know what their phones are dont let your phone just xiaomi
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nowadays flagship phones are becoming too expensive for useless enhancements agreed totally phone over is useless
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,great phone no flaws and great software at least not too much bloatware
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,have bought iphone pro max months ago and what felt is not that comfortable like the more why do you think its not comfortable enough to hold just get thin clear case from them
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post bruh gb ram is far enough for iphones they dont use it like android companies do
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,listen apple software improvement is terrible at least an android phone which runs on andro more so apple is horrible because your year old iphone cant open newest apps that literally doesnt have any sense
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive always had android got tired of waiting all the time till the carrier would get more listen apple software improvement is terrible at least an android phone which runs on android will be able to get almost all apps on the latest android update but apple is horrible got an iphone and even after updating it they were more than hundred apps couldnt download because it wasnt available in my present os like wtf
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,very very heavy bruh
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,very happy with it been using samsung exynos crap ultra note ultra ultra etc etc went to sleep woke up tomorrow morning half of battery gone iphone pro max is masterpiece no more samsung crap phones

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ridiculous in my country this phone use single sim card instead of dual get hongkong model
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,speaking of price its way too expensive now with things built in with airtag find my phone and cloud photo scanning crap this thing is an ultimate spy machine
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,okay have the answer for incoming call ringtone so the logic behind is when youre alr more eye roll
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bro still using android but ive use for few months ios think android its lik more more liberty theres no telling if your boundaries will have enough security thats the big difference btn androids and ios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its the best device with great battery backup and display is very smooth with hz it really creates difference when use my friends iphone think apple should give fast charging of minimum watts but how so ever watts charger maintains good battery life of iphone am using it for almost months watching movies playing games its the best device till date would recommend everyone who can afford this device to buy pro max been waiting for ultra to release so can upgrade from my plus but know ultra will have great display but cant match the battery performance of pro max and also apple ecosystem is the best but always keep latest iphones and androids both because of interest like to have different devices
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,best thing about apple is the software upgrade support then the smooth app experience else its just bag of nails soooo difficult to do very simple files stuff painful settings menu dont bother trying to use another browser no usb what silly brow but still good piece of computing tech it does of what want still getting the ultra for my everyday business phone yo
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,being an android user for years and months finally made up my mind to try ios and got more bro still using android but ive use for few months ios think android its like cheap copy of ios but cant fell more free in android and bought more than bucks on apps in google so for me dont woth but android cant maneger spces that is sad
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,use carplay for motorcycles or cars its awesome and safe no need to take your phone out of more fully agree with you iphone comes with its family the echo system but somehow am finding solution to some of the problems listed by me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,these are the freedom limitations that stopped me thinking to switch from android to iphone more yes absolutely right but all said and done am still getting very refreshing experience with this pro notwithstanding the lack of customisation options android is close to brain and ios is governed by heart at least for me somehow trying to adjust with its limitations thanks for your revert anyway
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wonder when will apple remove the norch on their mobile phones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the se is there or you could consider getting something like the iphone which costs around more or maybe you should definitely consider getting an iphone because it had great cameras great battery life and faster chip
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agree its one of the best phones ive had since recently after christmas in and sinc more holds up pretty well you say months old flagship it better my phone is over years old and it holds up pretty well to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this the perfect iphone to date no android phone equivalent to it thank god and the holy spirit for give the inventor knowledge
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the best iphone have ever used agree its one of the best phones ive had since recently after christmas in and since this crappy year has came to an end its really soild and it holds up pretty well in
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,since you aint in rush suggest you wait for pro max itll have hairdryer more lol hair dryers dont even exist yet on iphone but since apple removed the plastic on either of the iphone boxes it helps to save the environment
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes know iphone pro max is powerful device as mentioned earlier am not in hurry to more since you aint in rush suggest you wait for pro max itll have hairdryer and laundry machine
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hai all why my iphone speaker can hear sound but so dimmed even at high level yea could tell but obviously you should definitely do some research
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why iphone always heat at back while surfing internet do anything activities then when they heat the screen view so blurr bit what to do
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you clearly dont know anything about ios hai all why my iphone speaker can hear sound but so dimmed even at high level
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,doubt you have pro max not everyone believes that you currently using pro max and more no doubt its really happen always true
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,same ios has been nightmare you clearly dont know anything about ios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes same with me hot and drain so fastsometime auto restart back doubt you have pro max not everyone believes that you currently using pro max and have issues with it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,simple apple enginer not as smart as android enginer who design very fast charging even in more you clearly dont know anything about the apple appstore its actually equal paidfree just like androids app store but atleast apples apps work on all devices and not selected
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this phone its the real deal theres nothing even close on the market right now more this phone is cheaper than the pro max at launch
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is anybody faccing issue with iphone pro max battery getting hot and drain sometimes fast more think because of liion battery
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,help me please why my iphone pro max unable to display the general menu why
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,can some one help me why my iphone pro max camera become blurr after snap the picture what cause of this problem
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,am also using samsung galaxy since last years almost want upgrade not android more waiting is always good if you can of course the newer model will be better than current mainly the difference for next year will be the notch finally going away if this is important to you try to wait otherwise they will be very similar devices
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,normally in rd year battery would need to be replace on all daily use handheld
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple doesnt want to add or charging because it will kill the battery in year they couldve at least added the support for charging its reasonably fast and doesnt reduce battery capacity too much
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why arent the sensor sizes listed in the specs wasnt this major marketing point by apple this generation
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why apples iphone charging is slow simple apple enginer not as smart as android enginer who design very fast charging even in mid range phone also apple ceo is going to have extra profit to sell the fast charger of iphone pro max majority of application in ios is paid notike android free full version
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,anyone having problem with the microphone on loudspeaker dont think thats problem with microphone or loudspeaker since the sound quality was good enough for me can barely hear it while im fliming video or listening to music watch videos or even movies they sound pretty loud for me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is so true my pm has roughly the same dimensions with my old plus its just bulkier more have samsung plus nowwanna upgradewhich is better apple pro mac or samsung ultra or samsung ultra
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hey has somebody faced with touchscreen problem corners of the phone dont work properly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no gorilla glass victus they even had ceramic shield since the lineup but much better on my pro max which im currently using for youtube thumbnails texting messages checking emails and playing some games or watching movies
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its very good phone too bad its just iosso closed and limited platform with slowing down more bruh stop with the lies never had an issue with performance it seems faster than enough for me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they need to have life bro exactly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this iphone pro max is truly brilliant phone so much better than the android ones did have samsung sony and several other android phones and tbh theyre rubbish this iphone pro max has brilliant battery chip is the fastest you can get in mobile phone fact and the built quality is outstanding il never go back to android phones again best thing ever did was to turn to apple and iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agreed but its not too bulkier for me these people whine way too much and would call more they need to have life bro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you wont find better battery anywhere the iphone pro max has the finest battery on the market right now
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hate battery iphone but is good camera hours for playing game well you wont find any better battery pro max has the best battery on smartphone market so far
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its too heavy and camera is badly designed when you leave phone on the desk it lays on more having case on the phone is personal choice tho why would they suggest cases
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone should be an alternative to macbook and not dslr apple can can replace sim card slot with esim but removing mm audio jack was bad decision steve jobs combined web browser an ipod and phone to make an iphone think tim cook cant remember this let us buy song from apple music store for life time with cheaper price everone isnt rich but love apple iphone holds best design best hardware best os best ui best feel
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its kinda powerful but the software is trash
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the haters love to talk about apple thats why iphones always have the most comments on this website
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ios software stull trash and behind by three years ios the best mobile os ever yeah the android years have to copy copy copy android always copy its launcher screen lol all china default launcher ios design and now android copy ios features next time when ios change android will copy again why copy you may ask because android is unoptimised built without thinking just throw everything inside so its laggy and consume tons of ram and energy for nothing so now they copy ios efficiency and smoothness but its still not enough the core of android is rotten so the fanboys is hoping fuchsia is the next savoir
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still the most powerful device on earth apple the best moved from android ios software stull trash and behind by three years
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,stop the nagging can you compare porsche to benz gwagon no man the oppo find more two completely different vehicles that should never be compared ones the most iconic sports car of all time and ones an suv
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,people like you will always say the notch in iphone are not that bad when you are using the more when you use social media webbrowsing the screen around the notch area shows the time battery how is that different from punch hole design faceid is apples security it needs an array of sensors to work properly even in total darkness give it more tech and time it will shrink into the bezels in the future like ipad pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,notch is the security of the phone phone screen is greater than ratio so when watching more people like you will always say the notch in iphone are not that bad when you are using the phone browsing through the web and scrolling social media it is there people like you will always say having it is good because of security benefits but youll never admit that apple has its flaws hole punch is better
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the most uncomfortable device used so far absolutely agree ive go big hands and the weight combined with how wide it is makes it pain to use sometimes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ok for those idiots hating let me clear it up have had android all my smartphone life more can relate know iphone are little bit more expensive than the other flagship devices but as someone who had used samsung for years switched to iphone for once and upgraded from the galaxy overall iphone feels very solid and premium and made samsung phones feels physically way cheaper than it actually is can say made the right choice and had no regrets getting this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wrost battery tecno common is better then this iphone pro max bruh nobody cares about the worst battery life on the iphone pro series as they were fixed after it was released youll be able to get through full day with no issues
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,pixel pro is overrated indeed its good but overall the iphone pro max is great more got this phone now its incredible really cant go wrong with this apart from the phone the softwares are just so damn good ugh
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,best phone very smooth premium feel stereo speakers are amazing and camera is always superb
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,had the gb silver since tues only charged it once since then and compared to the series it is alot better in every way love that fact you can just copy over everything you have on your previous iphone with little effort leaving you with nothing to do but use your device straight away instead of taking alot of time to set it up everything is logged in apart from apps that have strong security like bankingebaypaypal etc recommend apple they have alot covered and no they do not copy android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its the best phone on the market nothing else to say hating it its like hating porsche more stop the nagging can you compare porsche to benz gwagon no man the oppo find pro is far more better than the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,using pro max for the last months have never found such smooth phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,that will just makes it even wider and heavier how about urgreen clear case
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,use spigen case so it wont be that uncomfortable to use that will just makes it even wider and heavier
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what makes it more premium the fact that its so heavy and uncomfortable to hold no one cares
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so youre saying that youre getting an ultra rather than just the pro max more what makes it more premium the fact that its so heavy and uncomfortable to hold
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont too hurry buyt this phone the fate is be like ip nm chipset coming ahead watch out hauaha ip series is coming dont buy it only if it give us nm chipset or remain the fate as ip series for now
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,my battery was great on it but now it has gone for repair as could not get any signal turns more so youre saying that youre getting an ultra rather than just the pro max its fine most people have personal preferences but if you want the premium feeling then you should go for the pro or pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agree dont really agree with this hater but its the least uncomfortable to use one handed because have huge hands and never had issues with it trust me this guy is real bs and he needs to stop spreading facts or conspiracy theories about apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone battery is only great becos most apps only run at hz but they will run snappier as more apps will support hz so if you had the iphone pro max out of the box then yes there were some of those apps and games that supports hz promotion technology such as minecraft which personally played it when was younger back then
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post wrong the pro maxs performance is soild seening in benchmark results after updates they are no lags or delays in speed so dont know what youre saying it depends how numbers are translated to the real world so no havent had any issues with performance as it should expect to get better after updates
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,just got my pro max yesterday performance is great the blue color is nice but its ridic more agree
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the more you talk trash about apple and their smartphones design the less care more well the only thing thats great about the pro max was the all day lasting battery life promotion technology with ltpo soild performance zippy cellular in more places and advanced cameras with macro mode however you cant go wrong with the pro max there is plethora of those folks that always repeating the same thing every single year
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the more you talk trash about apple and their smartphones design the less care more english isnt my main language for what read so what do you expect lol sure but id never had issues with square edges it feels premium to look at which equals the better
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the more you talk trash about apple and their smartphones design the less care what more the more you talk trash about apple and their smartphones design the less care what you say but elaborate on what your opinion will be instead of negatively spreading false informations so im just talking trash about apple despite the fact that mention three other phones ive bought of theirs in my first comment and that also have owned three ipads an appletv and macbook pro even use an apple magic trackpad on my windows desktop because they make the best one but im just an apple hater right lol do you have picked it up in store yet read can you are able to be said picked it up yesterday literally the first words of the comment have you used it out of the box indeed have for couple days now thats how know if you have one and didnt liked it id like to hear why its uncomfortable to use with the squared edges digging into my pinky finger and palm the pro max was perfectly comfortable to use can sit and scroll for hours on end no issue this pro max feel that have to reposition it in my hand every few minutes since it becomes distractingly uncomfortable otherwise im not listening no youre not reading that much is apparent from what youve written
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no fm radio shame on you apple really fm radio you know pretty much every fm station has live stream you can listen to right even the local stations where live hot springs arkansas all have live streams you can listen to over the internet so why in the world do you need fm radio built into your phone idk of any brand that still has that in their phones that died long ago along with ir blasters
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its has tb storage bruh the thing is most people use gb and not use more gb like me alway more first of all the tb is great but its still very expensive so there is no need to get the extra gb just to keep the stuff but investing tb on the cloud storage id say its well worth it other than buying tb pro series from apple and second doubt that phones would go to inch which wish it will be the case but the bigger id say is better so no issues with the size thats bit large
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,waited whole year to upgrade waited for pixel pro and it wasnt outstanding thin more pixel pro is overrated indeed its good but overall the iphone pro max is great in terms of battery life camera quality and performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,on point and apple nailed it this time especially that battery heck its just mah but more way longer
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yep downloaded the latest beta and it resolved the camera issues now theres no notif more hi just updated my ip pm to the latest ios but still the issue persist just want to know if the issue was resolved to you when you updated to the latest ios tia
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,after researching for many weeks all different possibilities what to buy from xiaomi samsung realme pixel oneplus its like the best is to not buy anything because meanwhile middrangers are soooo powerfull and fast and kinda cheap etc they also have overheating issues software issues buggs camera flaws etcso either not buy anything or go all in and take either iphone pro or samsung ultra at least there you know what you paying for
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,that is because of power efficient nm processor and gpu
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lovephones dec the world is talking about the fact that the global pixel is over apple fake the company fro more steve jobs quotes good artists copy great artists steal we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas dude wasnt even ashamed of just using an idea from different brand and changing it slightly then call it his own who knows what else he copied and stole all companies have to use other brands ideas in order to stay on top not one company can just stay all original without falling behind in sales and model designs innovation requires using an idea to make it better which all brands try to do
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the world is talking about the fact that the global pixel is over apple fake the company from google its true makes good phones but think it can get over the iphone at most it gets par with samsung it has nothing stable simple company that when it saw its fame dared more thats why the camera jumped from sqm to sqm not even the shape of the cameras was kept on pixel and they tried to copy iphone on pixel pro they copied samsung series many say that iphone not worth the money but on the contrary apple did not copy anything from others they were appreciated from their first models and iphone was the most appreciated and sold phone in the world at that time has the same no of megapixels sqm from iphone so far but they are much improved
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they buy it for one of the finest screens our there for best video recording you can find on more on point and apple nailed it this time especially that battery heck its just mah but could last longer than mah android phones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they only buy it because it has one of the fastest processor and just to show off they buy it for one of the finest screens our there for best video recording you can find on the phone xperia proi excluded one of the best cameras for pictures for the best battery you can see on flagship phone aswell with software apples ecosystem its all powered by the best chip on the phone ever thats why people are buying it not just the chip
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agree his claims and informations are full of lies seriously what kind of whiny baby wo more think the power of this phone same with vivo and oppo great right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,trash yet many are buying it agree his claims and informations are full of lies seriously what kind of whiny baby would talk trash about tech let alone apple and other brands havent had any problems with iphones they were still as good but the battery life was probably the biggest jump from the even though its the same as the predecessor
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is trash trash yet many are buying it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ok dont trust this dude and his informations he thinks the pro max is trash when its not lol seriously people needs to grow up and move on and stop with the lies and misinformations
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its very heavy grams ridiciolous when you leve it on the table because of the cam more to be honest im totally fine with the premium feel of this phone cuz think the extra weight is well worth it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not everyone agrees with you and your stupid facts seriously if you dont get with the more you need to switch to decaf dude and chill whats with the tripwire emotional anger were discussing phones lighten the hell up do you own one have you even picked one up in store seriously your comment carries little weight if it isnt based on any experience if you do have one and didnt like it id love to hear why otherwiseim not really listening
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post pro max but dont see enough of reason to get this especially because they fixed the issue with the unless the camera quality were as good as low lighting conditions the lidar sensor seems to do better job with night mode as it gets better and better after updates
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,little advice pls get the xperia proi especially for your high demand in photography and more how about no
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,on this website they say that the display resolution is isnt that lower then the more no those are just different orientations of the numbers is greater than
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple is ok you cant upgrade your internal storage bummer this phone is only the first with more use my phone for personal use and business use shooting lots of video and still photos and ive never even come close to my gb limit so im not sure it matters how many tb phones there are plus theres always external storage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,just ordered it first top of the line phone for me since got my iphone plus in upgrading from an iphone plus this is probably going to feel like moving from my blackberry ciurve to an iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,also experiencing the same ip pm tried to test the display phones on the store which more yep downloaded the latest beta and it resolved the camera issues now theres no notification sound at all lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,playing games on mobile phone makes you gamer then what is gaming on pc and consoles more platform doesnt matter
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,with all the new tech in iphone it still feels like apple has lost it they dont give more apple give what the exact need of ours not our expectation needs they are very smart producer imo even am not appple fanboy actually
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,details information about this mobile
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the bigger number of megapixels does not always mean better pictures it depends on many fac more exactly thats why specifically pointed those info for comparison
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,actually the number of megapixels dont really count as the best picture quality it has more precisely thats why want him to realize that based on real life usage of these phone cameras
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im an android user for the past years and after doing lot of research now planning to more little advice pls get the xperia proi especially for your high demand in photography and maybe video in fact its the only phone next to dslr and and works like dslr there are other android devices with similar camera quality
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,but for me efficiency is the main course all high end android chipset has high number of the more with all the new tech in iphone it still feels like apple has lost it they dont give you what you want from phone instead they you make adapt to theirs its sometime uncomfortable in the real world
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,pro max is great but you people arent really getting what you always pay for
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,please apple make big screen inch battery and just inch mp sensor camera an more apple sells the ipad mini
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes xperia has oled screen audio experience for internet and superfast for more but for me efficiency is the main course all high end android chipset has high number of their tdp apple still rock on this as their high end phone just have for max means that their phone not too quick to get hot cmiiw
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,camera watching movies and internet surfing xperia is the answer not iphone yes xperia has oled screen audio experience for internet and superfast for gaming
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,good luck with the screen dimming as soon as you start playing anything what are you even saying bro it covers the dimming less often than the pm which it doesnt look bad as ive seen some people were facing less issues with this display on their phones the point is if you got the pro max and have faced issues with this display that dims id say you either have choices for you to choose from make an appointment to make sure if this is good batch or not cancel the order and get the regular pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if youre gamer like me id recommend you this phone since it has the most powerf more playing games on mobile phone makes you gamer then what is gaming on pc and consoles please dont insult the gaming community im offended
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,good battery life good camera color grading but garbage phone camera doesnt come out sharp more ach soo feel that too in ip what solid phone nice input sir me now think twice to buy iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive samsung power delivery charger if buy this iphone pro max can get the more for battery health use lowest ampere output possible ie ampere output old charger or put in desktop to charge use good quality charger no need from apple only
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,anyone experiencing quick camera flickering issue when it is launched started noticing th more also experiencing the same ip pm tried to test the display phones on the store which bought the device and all of them are behaving the same from ip ip mini ip pro ip pm hope it will be resolve by future updates
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yeah mate agree same its just weird to think that is an absolute shame and not that easy even though its garbage and overrated because of crapvid might be just as good as but not for the rest of the countries
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,also the word something completely unrelated is nonsense was referring to cra more so its simply comparison
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so is this an opinion on the apple iphone pro max or something completely unrelated also the word something completely unrelated is nonsense was referring to crapvid they just ruined the entire months especially with the mask garbage it is as overrated as hell when it comes to the pandemic
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,then its up to me to roast the crap out of the pandemic in this forum so dont more so is this an opinion on the apple iphone pro max or something completely unrelated
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you know nothing about tech do you ufs is not even comparable with the current apple nvme more yeah right and gb is better than too and mistery processor is better than snapdragon series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dear apple please use for your ram from lddpr and use storage ufs and use mah batter more you know nothing about tech do you ufs is not even comparable with the current apple nvme storage ufs is much slower and has less write cycles while also using more power and producing more heat most companies use ufs as it means that you get ready to use asic controller made by samsung which means around million less in rd costs for the manufacturers
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,had the xs max for years and it is as speed as baught it now switched to pro max never knew the xs max is year old phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,after years using android phones samsung huawei xiaomi switched to iphone then pro max this year never though would since considered apple prices way too high for phones but progress accomplished in photo department and use of oled screens made me try the iphone line am more than happy with pro max bluetooth audio is another league compared to android phones apple clearly knows its software photos are gorgeous screen is joy to look at battery life on is more than ok had xiaomi mi lite which is pity in that regard and excellent on pro max even speakers are excellent loud and clear iphone pro max is very expensive phone but yes its worth the cost
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,was planning to buy this device but saw its specifications and it isnt fm radio supported more iphone never had an fm radio
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well its probably because they removed the headphone jack on the and plus that more are you that blind they wanted to sell airpods so they removed the headphone jack not the opposite way buddy lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,but this is forum for the iphone pro max not your thoughts on the pandemic then its up to me to roast the crap out of the pandemic in this forum so dont really care that much lol imagine the pandemic dies would be right year to start but hate when the pandemic revives repeatedly after each years ended crapvid restrictions is canceled
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,cuz the pandemic is garbage and overrated thats for sure iphone pro max is be more but this is forum for the iphone pro max not your thoughts on the pandemic
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bruh nvme is better than ufs there is no competition imagine asking for downgrade lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is trash the mask garbage isnt over yet so months to go then this crappy year more why in the world are you talking about this on board about the iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ram is not as big of an issue on iphone due to apps being built with swiftllvm native applic more thanks for replying mate and very informative insights had the chance to try the device at costco it feels smooth but not as snappy as my pixel xl before anyone reacts or get offended let me explain think its the animation speed as in android can actually change the speed of animation to make it feel more snappy guess thats how ios like their animation speed as the soc of this one is not really slow remember couple of yrs ago few people lost it when said redmi note feels faster than the iphone definitely getting ds fon just need to clear the fundings from lower upper house which is manage by the same person
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,never know that there would be tb phone apple is not the first smartphone company to offer tb storage option
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive been wanting to get this phone ive never owned an iphone before hesitant coz of the low more ram is not as big of an issue on iphone due to apps being built with swiftllvm native applications the pro models have gb of ram which is enough to last these devices until apple officially stops supporting them apple hasnt intentionally slowed down any devices since batterygate that know of ios at this point on the pro models is probably every bit as smooth as android apple handles dynamic refresh rate and stuff lot better than android device manufactures after all ltpo is an apple technology the battery screen speakers and cameras are basically among the best of the best in phone this year as package ive been life long android user and the pros actually make me want to switch since youre finally getting all the special doodads that android phones have this year the high refresh rate displays on the pro models would suggest going to local retailer and playing around with the demo phone hands on for little while and see how it feels to you if you like it buy it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,people in be like finally the crappy year is over no more restrictions and crappy face masks and crapvid
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,about days back purchased pro max and was surprised to see the battery drain arroun more read my reply before commenting battery life is not huge problem for some people it does last through day with single charge disabling some of those apps in the background would help the job better for battery life but make sure the background refresh is off im seeing some people who are facing no issues with battery life on the pro max it lasts through day with no issues just like on the pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its funny how in the best camera of section it says the pro max has over processed photos when its not
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not bad phone at all agreed but people are wasting their time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im already vaccinated so whatever you say is crappy year for everyone more imagine if the pandemic didnt end you would think that convincing your friends or family to get vaccinated if they follow up their medical health would work well seriously this year is crap and so does the pandemic but im not really psychic so personally cant tell you about when the pandemic will just die soon
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,shut it john you want the pandemic to end convince your friends and family to follow your lo more im already vaccinated so whatever you say is crappy year for everyones lives crapvid literally just destroyed it all and made the entire life more miserable than but im not psychic so cant tell you when the pandemic is ending soon after but only time will tell

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,we russians never buy chinese phones we only have iphones here and we belong to asia russians are mostly considered from the west since thier not at all like asian culture the middle east is mainly naive people the russian arent hat naive but still buy iphone just like classic
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,to buy this phone in asianot japan and the uae people have to sell their kidneys agreed xd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple is almost always late to the party but when they do come theyre often the best dressed
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its funny how apple fanbois and bts stans have so much similarities between them just say any more
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its not fantansy mp means mega pixels after taking ur photo ability to zoom more thank you professor now you may take sip of water and please have seat
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothing is new very expensive phone but low specs youre spastic if you think the has low specs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is pro max in picture just look battery upgrade yup alone already destroyed sd chipsets from the future
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,agreed all those stuff are here for marketing even tho it means nothing but to someone more its not fantansy mp means mega pixels after taking ur photo ability to zoom will be more bt if its mp it will way less also more mah means more battery backup if that same processor and everything kept in half of that battery capacity like mah its battery backup will very low
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,uhm you need huge ram if youre going to play emulator games gbgb is still enough for android in android you can even install windows also can emulate many other devices like ps
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,except camera sensors every part of iphone is engineered by apple and so are the more think iphone display has panel which is the same panel can see in other premium oled phones and panel is made by samsung its the best samsung panel which they provide to companies other than samsung samsung premium phone like ultra uses different panel which wont get in other companies oled display and its the best one apple is brand which doesnt manufacture many things they are mostly designing assembling and software company not much of manufacturing their modem is from qualcomm display panel from samsung processor from tsmc camera sensor from sony etc
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,live in kuwait and and tb version is completely stock out unable to find anywere so more go for the option
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,when the notch is gone completely will upgrade from the not before then go buy oneplus pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone is still the best when it comes to video camera most people just cant afford it more theyre not more expensive than samsung flagships these days
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,waiting for the camera test between this and the new xperia pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lmao thats not how the arguments works displaysamsung componentssamsung ca more except camera sensors every part of iphone is engineered by apple and so are the displays apple is not taking samsungs displays they engineer them and samsung is just manufacturing it also no other components are made by samsung chips are also engineered by apple manufactured by tsmc get your facts straight before saying anything bud
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,better samsung phones when tho thats not true just check the attitude benchmark test of this iphone to those so called samsung phones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so many sore android users here anyway had promax and went for pro tb this time awesome is big step up very noticeable upgrades to display battery and camera and the performance is unreal and had similar performance of faceid and was already very good still on it has improved significantly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,only mp camera and only zoom so bad you dont know anything about phones number of mp doesnt mean anything about camera quality though however must agree telephoto camera zoom is bit letdown but its not anything terrifying
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,fine stick to the iphone lmao thats not how the arguments works displaysamsung componentssamsung camera sensorssony seriously get your facts right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you dont need big rams to run android either just companies are beefing up to fool cons more uhm you need huge ram if youre going to play emulator games
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,unlike android devices you dont need to have such big rams to run ios you dont need big rams to run android either just companies are beefing up to fool consumers that they should have excessive amount of ram for better performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yusuf suleman oct did not realize in my whole life that iphones have such little ram compared to other flagshi more unlike android devices you dont need to have such big rams to run ios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,for the gb version in egypt thats real nice
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if gb is nice
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why lipo lithium ion is used becuz it can store more plus its more expensive to make lipol more bruh polymer costs more than ion anyone can search it up on google how high are you right nowlmao
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,did not realize in my whole life that iphones have such little ram compared to other flagship phones from their time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,stop making up stories you never switched you have to understanda huge majority of comments in all iphone specs and articles on this website are by android fanboys who wish to have owned an iphone but never havelots of mobicelxiaomitecno etcusers coming to troll in iphone comments and what they often post shows that they have never used an iphone in their life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,please apple make iphone battery bigger with lipo technology mah why lipo lithium ion is used becuz it can store more plus its more expensive to make lipolymer is cheap and easier to wear down than liion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so here am with my comment about battery so am getting two hours of screen on time more than pro max so my final words about this phone are if you want hz good battery good sound and good camera go for pro max if you have pro max stay on it if you have pro max think it is good time to change that would be my opinion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bla bla bla bla iphone pro max is killer battery is better than any other smart phone more agreed all those stuff are here for marketing even tho it means nothing but to someone its all fantasy when they hear mp or mah
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,congrats gsm arena for mentioning things like apple ios is not for everyone you more well its pretty dumb to say that android is better than ios find both softwares really really awesome and advanced they both got their ups and downs eg android is more customizable but on the other hand ios is more basic and simple to use at the end lf the day it all comes to personal preference
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,love ios
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nearly opinions what gorgeous device apple the god of being smart
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive come from being an android user my whole smartphone life until now had to purchase new phone due to the fact my was almost destroyed from me landing on it it still worked but barely the dilemma was either get it fixed or wait for the new iphone im so glad did yes there is only one thing miss from the it is aod other than that the iphone blows my old samsung out of the water its built better has better camera system faster and just feels so much better in my hand the the even call quality and overall sound are way better know its only been few weeks since came to the darkside as my kids said but so glad did now see why my friends swear by iphones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,pal you are damn right the market is full of all kinds of devices that are probably much more finally someone who understands quality
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no usb type
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,cant imagine how people hold smartphone with mm width in their hands most people just prefer phones that arent literal tv remotes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if iphone use usb type instead of lightning removing notch and give back touchid sure it more yeah they should make iphone with touch id on the side of the phone like on the ipad air th gen
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hello to all and greetings from montenegro just purchased my pro max and up until now the phone is more than superb great camera cinematic mode hz screen not that much of difference at first look but when working on it little bit longer yeah the difference is there for battery cant tell yet but will coming from pro max its not that big difference but it is there phone is more fluid quicker and so on and so on main thing remain battery since am more than power user so in few days will let all know who wants to know with pro max had screen on time form hrs and that was good leaving me with of battery so much for now
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,id say with iphones the longer you wait the more you get for your money example if you have an iphone plus and you upgrade to the pro max you will get lot more out of your money than having an iphone pro max and upgrade to the pro max the difference between the iphone or compared to the pro max is gonna be much more noticable than the the difference between pro max and pro max since iphones can last very long time the best way to spend money is probably just hold on to an iphone for to years before upgrading and you might be able to get more out of your money if you can understand because dont know how to write things properly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes there are several reasons for upgrade have both pro max and pro max gb mode more couldnt agree with you more but that doesnt actually mean the pro max is bad when it comes to performance camera and battery life unless youve watched some movies non stop and it does feel like it would last you about day or so without having to worry about the battery being dead
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,oops mean the only thing thats new to the iphone is the macro mode which you more yes there are several reasons for upgrade have both pro max and pro max gb model battery is much better though charging is little bit slower hz pro motion display is butter smooth and touch is much responsive and is the best reason for upgrade speaker both call clarity and dolby sound through both speaker is louder crisper and pleasant to ur ear camera is almost equal but macro mode and zoom is added advantage there are several modes and tones with added advantages notch is much smaller call reception and network quality is better much better cpu and gpu performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no hatred for any brand or os in fact were grateful to have so many options to choose more oops mean the only thing thats new to the iphone is the macro mode which you could get closer to subject if anyone who has the pro max dont see reason to upgrade to pro max just for camera but it depends on what things are important to you
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,glad your sister got the pro max thought you hate the iphone even though it is more no hatred for any brand or os in fact were grateful to have so many options to choose from be it android or ios apple or samsung
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,my sister just bought this phone today got chance to try my hands on it own the more glad your sister got the pro max thought you hate the iphone even though it is smaller notch it doesnt look that ugly but it works well without an ancient mask unless you have the watch to be able to scan your face with an ancient mask
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im curious why the ipad mini have finger print sensor while the phone doesnt have
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no one should no one should uh you do realize that investing isnt hard thing to do though do think that crypto is the reliable banking company for money investment just like youtube which you need subscribers and views
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,would suggest buying any good android phone wait till next years iphone as its completely new with lots of upgrades not just these few frm iphone to series save fr year buy the iphone pro max or whatever new name its gonna have next year trust me on this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,we have something called as sd slotim guessing its new term in applelalaland we can use more so then tell me is the tb available worldwideand what if your phone doesnt have an sd card slot like the galaxy fold series the rog phone series samsung galaxy flip google pixel phones etc how can you use the tb sd card without any dongle
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,very good phone in my opinion the design could be better the internals are incredible the cameras are great especially video the battery life is incredible outlasting phones with more capacity top tier stuff very impressed
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lol apple has already released tb model since and up until now they are off more we have something called as sd slotim guessing its new term in applelalaland we can use tb one with our onboard storage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is probably the best phone in the market if you consider every aspect eg overheating vi more sure it is but to be honest guess its up to their own preferences
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this literally looks like the lastgen phone its good design for but more youre kinda right but dont think that many people will go ahead and upgrade from iphone to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is there way to make the iphone have multi window apps opened at the same time part from the rd party apps which is basically web versions of some of the apps
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,since me and my girl have iphones plus and it is considered an upgrade that can agree on if you used an apple device for few years already its massive upgrade but if you for instance had the pro and then switched to this its pretty much the same phone but boxier and lot heavier
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,some people say this battery is supersonical is very good result but absolutely no ci more what are you talking about one of the rare phones saw that actually beat pro max is poco with weak sd percent sure its could be something else pro max beats almoste all or maybe even all flagship phones we got out rn
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so iphone pro max score is antutu and iphone more dont just see the antutu score man see other things like bench marks camera hz display and battery
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,httpsyoutubeqwxro here the results are totally opposite there seems to be some is more then it seems both of these videos are little inaccurate in video recording cause the iphone didnt perform like it should in techdroiders video and in michaels video the oneplus also didnt perform as good as it did in techdroider video but that might just be how it is maybe not everyone will be able to replicate the same kind of results
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,firstly iphone was the best phone made but now its nice phone but other phones have better features then this phone its gaming performance is absolutely amazing although its worth buying
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,firstly dont talk about people you dont know and also what about him is so biased more httpsyoutubeqwxro here the results are totally opposite there seems to be some issue with the iphone that techdroider got was shocked to see the graininess in his videos thats not really the case
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well duh he is indeed biased indian guy he probably does videos for reviews and some more firstly dont talk about people you dont know and also what about him is so biased he probably does videos for reviews and some crap that no one would like to watch the fact that you said probably shows uncertainty and barly have any clue of the dude channel on average his videos are getting around to veiws with his most popular being mil
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how is he an amateur when hes been doing reviews leaks camera comparisons and speed te more well duh he is indeed biased indian guy he probably does videos for reviews and some crap that no one would like to watch
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this was test done in minutes rest are picture tests done by amateur guy apples more how is he an amateur when hes been doing reviews leaks camera comparisons and speed test for years on youtube
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,check oneplus pro vs iphone pro max video recording httpsmyoutubecomwatchvxherw more this was test done in minutes rest are picture tests done by amateur guy apples video stabilization is the best stabilization on the market backed up by great software lets wait few weeks for some real video comparisons not minute long comparison based on short clips
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats cap google pixel cannot record fps its really useless to talk abou more check oneplus pro vs iphone pro max video recording httpsmyoutubecomwatchvxherwdgss btw oneplus had better video rendering
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,google pixel got fps video recording with mp camerawhile iphone still cant thats cap google pixel cannot record fps its really useless to talk about video recording here because its well known fact that apple has marketleading video recording and there is nothing you can say to deny that fact no phone managed to beat apples videos and probably wont that soon
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,your camera sample should include night portrait without it your review of camera photo quality is not complete
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,almost all iphones have low battery spec for example the iphone which have is only mah only dont like it should use it while charging xd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if mass is heavy for you then youre even weaker than little year old girl eat som more just years ago people like you used to say like that guy and saying everything more than is considered heavy as brick fanboys logic is ohh sorry my bad they dont have any
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what are the pro cons of pro max if you want to know the pros and cons about this beast of phone wait until the full review because heard some people that are already done with their unboxings cause lets be real the iphone pro max isnt really bad phone which every components are made by samsung performance wise is ok it still runs as quick as it used to be but battery life is really excellent no compromises here
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this time pro max is quite good phone than any iphones before as people who had previous ones frm plus plus xs max pro max are quite happy even those who had pro max found this better by just issues they faced in previous phones only thing is this is the heaviest but its good phone with drawback of smallest of repair only can be done at apple with highest costs which is equal to new android phone to tell the truth dont know why you buying this iphone when there are android phones out there which can do way more than this phone can there are best android phones out there you can just install good security antivirus apps search for apks online use free apps all the time the phones are great have samsung fold which is so good once you use that then its impossible to go back to any phones its so good
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,there will never be usbc on an iphone charging port will be removed on or series probably portless design has already been spoken about many times was hoping the would be portless or at least the mag safe time connection so no psychical
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,in my country have all the colors in stock want to change from black but want color more yes they do have it in stock for your country but in my country they dont actually have it in stock yet probably because due to crapvid and some shit cause is an absolute pile of crap
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lightning port sucks good thing eu has brain to make everyone use usb there will never be usbc on an iphone charging port will be removed on or series probably
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gold but the other ones were not in stock yet because of crapvid so maybe in the end of this more in my country have all the colors in stock want to change from black but want color that all people will like to buy after few years
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,consider buying the pro max have xs max color black what color do you recommand gold but the other ones were not in stock yet because of crapvid so maybe in the end of this year they will restock them
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,whats your opinion on lighting port if apple ditches lighting port due to eu forcing ty more lightning port sucks good thing eu has brain to make everyone use usb
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the much awaited upgrade from pro max to pro max the series last year had specs that more am think of upgrade from my do you think its worthy but the transferring the whatsapp from android to ios make me think twice
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,love how iphones look and their os and interface are really neat and clean picture and disp more find that have things that like about each but also dont like for example on iphone you can turn off data use on certain apps while others can use it havent been able to find way to completely turn it off on my fe and on my samsung like that can see how much data ive used each month without having to reset it every month like did on my iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lol thats almost half pound and you say its not heavy are you fanboy by any chance you more we the apple fans criticised apple for making lightweight phones of and series so no youre wrong heavy dense weight feels more premium
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,heavy weight gain grseven heavier than ultra suitable only for body buliders hands if mass is heavy for you then youre even weaker than little year old girl eat some foods and stand up on your ase and go to gym nerddd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,there are ways to have massive battery and light phone for example the ultra which is more ultra is made of cheap materials and cheap aluminium
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,basically you want bigger battery apple adds bigger battery why is more there are ways to have massive battery and light phone for example the ultra which is bigger has significantly larger battery and more stuff packed onto it still manages to be lighter because of the material so dont see your point people have every right to complain about something fixable
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dude this outlasted the pro max by mile yeah youre right but honestly iphone pro max isnt really bad phone apple did the right thing in terms of performance and battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,please tell me can install custom modded apps without jailbreak or pc in ios and can mod more my man if you cant pay for game when youre buying phone you should not get the phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,inch display is too big too heavy however am happy about battery upgrade and promotion basically you want bigger battery apple adds bigger battery why is this phone so heavy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why apple is obsessed with stainless steel frames dont get it change to grade tita more steel is tight sturdy and dense not everyone likes paperweight phones with mass heavy phones feel more premium so steel is outta
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,way too heavy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes thats right it was exactly what wanted to say iphone was battery tan more agreed
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yeah but considering how long it lasts through the day with or without single charge the more yes thats right it was exactly what wanted to say iphone was battery tank looking forward to see what series got
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how can activate the true caller app on my iphone any ideas
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,actually not every iphone had smaller battery than in iphone series has the best ba more yeah but considering how long it lasts through the day with or without single charge the iphone pro max had some excellent long lasting battery life as well as the pro max which has its some advantages of being able to last longer the more battery gets bigger the better the battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wish for the iphone max pro can only afford the redmi nfc thats about cos more hahah you rocked and few more things like dual stereo speakers smaller notch also also quad camera setup
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,also sorry for answers my mistake forgot to respond on your battery thing apple more pro max last longer but the mini did not so they made it larger to be able to last longer the pro max has some really good benefits for the battery life camera and etc but price is still the same as the other ones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,did you seriously just try to play off apples abysmal battery problems as great ba more also sorry for answers my mistake forgot to respond on your battery thing apples battery managment is doing great job yes said that also will say iphone series was bad battery phone but take look at iphone it has way better battery than samsungs flagship from that year either you like it or no there are many comparisons which can confirm what am saying take look
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it will be nice to get one but hope it doesnt freeze often it doesnt froze often the display now has hz but developers needs to optimize the display to make it compatible with thirdparty apps and games in an upcoming update so the user experience will be seamless and smooth with no issues
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple seems out of innovation and makes the same phone over and over again apple should have be the pioneer of new innovation in mobile phones technology such as under display camera done by nubia foldable phones done by samsung and others transparent display and get rid off the notch perhaps for the next apple phones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,just received my pro max first impressions yep the benchmarks are out of the roof more do agree with you if one has an iphone pro max better wait for the iphone series before upgrading sure there are major improvements but if you are on tight budget then better stick to your iphone pro max but if you are coming from iphone series or earlier then it is worth it to upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont waste your money with usd can get samsung galaxy note which is alot better more all phones have their pros and cons if you prefer samsung then dont belittle iphone however one point that ios devices have that is very advantageous is the os and update support the iphone series this year will get updates up to years from now comparing to android which only gets years support so this iphone series will still be supported with update until sure the battery will degrade but you can have it replaced
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,isnt that heavy people who complain about phones weight should start hitting the gym more true
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bruh iphones are getting so much expensive the pro max at launch costs the same as the xs max pro max pro max at launch and the same goes for the pro as well the pro at launch costs the same as the xs pro pro at launch
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yeah no
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes youre right both samsung iphones are great think it all comes to personal more yes are right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,waiting for usb typec not the name changes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont use too many appsi just have very few appsi dont think its becau more oh sorry about the troubles wait for ultra more changes are expected
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,can you be my godfather hahaha wish have iphone plus in my life hahaha im young fella like you
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,checked most comments and noticed that so many people complaining about the weight more isnt that heavy people who complain about phones weight should start hitting the gym instead
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yes also think they are all great so it matter of choice you get an ios or android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,and also please dont hate me yes youre right both samsung iphones are great think it all comes to personal preference whether you want ios or android instead of spreading negativity about the two brands we should be thankful that weve such variety of os to choose from
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,really think samsung is good much people like samsung but for now apple is the winner beca more and also please dont hate me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you are wrong about the deteriorating rate of samsung without samsung apple wont be more really think samsung is good much people like samsung but for now apple is the winner because samsung doesnt have new phone yet maybe if samsung have new phone its will be great like apple apple and samsung is great brand dont be fanatic please guys
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,youre so incredibly wrong indeed apple makes market leading chips last years more did you seriously just try to play off apples abysmal battery problems as great battery management the company literally known for how quickly those batteries degrade and the screens are made by samsung designing it wouldnt matter if their competitor wouldnt build it for them also the gb this thing has absolutely doesnt hold candle to or gb ram android sure anything above even their specialised software isnt going to be effective enough
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if apple could lit the applelogo at the back of the mobile just like their laptops it would make iphone stand out from the rest here are few things that apple should consider for the backlit onoff availability solid colors availability gradient availability gradient orientation availability dragging of gradient colors to the desired position availability
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,samsung phone that has bad performance and deteriorates everyday in terms of performance and more you are wrong about the deteriorating rate of samsung without samsung apple wont be great you wouldnt even be able to look at their junk lcd display samsung is better buy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,samsungs cameras are cool for sure although their video sucks ass no one even use more you do realize that most internals in apple are made by third party companies and the major parts like the screen is made by samsung the only thing to give apple credit for is their bionic chips its what makes their camera and usage experience great
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ohwell that notch will be the urban legend someday instead of full screen withwithout th more good ho my god beautiful
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,just hate that top notch will just wait for ip to se weither they get rid of that top more ohwell that notch will be the urban legend someday instead of full screen withwithout the hole
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,where live consumers would have to pay for iphone pro max gb
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,weight oz the irony when apple fanboys used to bash any phone more than grams and call it brick now they will say innovation on kilo grams cell phone and they will accept it happily even if it was grams
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its notch and butt
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats why there is paypal for ebay and you dont buy from amazon marketplace well on amazon you can buy the real thing easily only if you know how to look for it unlike just typing and clicking buy search up apple and find their store there since its officially from them unlike some random iphone from some other store
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it still has notch bet ya can land an airplane on that whatever trash talker you dont even know anything about technology or something but seriously considering the fact that the notch is smaller which allows for more real estate housing the earpiece speakers to the top it should not bother you but it does bother others
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is cheaper than the ultra launch price at samsung is expenses as trash they ar more agree with most of your point but has glass back not plastic however theres rumours the will be downgraded to plastic next year too
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not much different from iphone pro max dont think it is worth it better wait for ip more what about hz screen
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,both apple and samsung flagships are overpriced but people who can afford it dont care status symbol and nothing else
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,usb whatever
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is the both sim is it full esim full active
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,huawei phones now has punch hole are you living in lol the notch have purpose face id which more secure than huawei period
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,are you ok mate this is gigantic are you on the right page the mini is small and even th more prob looking for
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what is problem with hz refresh rate in this dvice
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well thats your opinion and shouldnt care less find it ugly so say find it ugly more huawei phones now has punch hole are you living in
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the screen is to small that sucks are you ok mate this is gigantic are you on the right page the mini is small and even then its nice size
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yet another outstanding product from apple they have the ability to make outstanding products every year
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,chinese phones have spammed that notch so much that the front of this phone looks like from ye more first of all wrong the real estate of this display looks fine it doesnt bother some people second youre probably careless person who literally doesnt even have clue how this works last but not least people just dont care what your opinion is
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is so amazing have the best networks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what this is expensive and without wifi it has wifi
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if google pixel delivers what it spells for itself then iphone will no longer be brand king like googles phone and have had couple but the iphone is still better phone for most people its wellmade wellsupported welldesigned and has great set of cameras and great ecosystem its hard to beat
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so hrs and minutes huh there is no problem with battery life they definitely improved it with the pro max im sure itll last as long as the pro max waiting for gsmarenas confirmation after the review
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how much years apple stucked on mp from iphone pro max seven generations please give tim cook nobel prize or guinness he is awesome
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it is clear that your brain stuck on idle yes the fact you do not understand the fact tha more bro jack is not out dated it is out cast by apple for the sake of haptics and that stupid touch option which they had removed later on secondly they say that it requires space so what thats ovbious putting dedicated system inside needs space but rhey have to think out of the bow to bring alternative removing an option aint solution and if you use your mobiel device for media consumption and games then you will get to know that main problem else you are stupid af no offense
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,remind me again why is everyone talks so rubbish about the pro max even the apples chip is quite efficient and hz display is seamlessly smooth there are no such issues with the performance it actually looks fine on the pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so mm jack is an outdated standard now okay then my sennheiser dongle says that they are my wants to punch me in the face
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,and yet android phones with double the specs struggle to keep up with it thats right you can buy cheap tv and on the box it has all these hectic specs you go home and turn it on and its junk compared to beautiful sony or lg cmon now who thinks different to this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it is gb ram but it is worthy it why ios has always been very efficient with ram gb is more than enough guess
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,as have read in other media the ram memory is gb here it says how true will it be it is gb ram but it is worthy it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats nonsense mm jack is an essential part of phone it was essential back then more it is clear that your brain stuck on idle yes the fact you do not understand the fact that the mm jack is greatly outdated nowadays does not change the facts you are comparing an analog jack with digital one following the same logic then the vhs should produce better quality compared to dvd hd back then and bluerays nowadays what logic go get your facts together
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,pretty sure their sapphire glass protective lenses are just marketing as their sapphire glass is cheap and not pure so it scratches like normal glass very high quality right lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,can you please specify how this advantage is taken of by ios always see that the bionic is more yes they dont use of the performance this is early benchmarks but anyway we can see more soon usually they lower the core speed around because of the phone its small and will overheat its not laptop or tablet they will usually see better performance than the iphone but for more we will wait and see
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,of course it is thats nonsense mm jack is an essential part of phone it was essential back then until the launch iphone where companies follow apple footstep on removing it for reducing production cost what now are you trying to say including charging brick in the box is also getting outdated
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,do you want or something he doesnt care what he wants all he do was just to complain about the size being too small even though its as identical as the pro max but its really not that small so who cares
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if this phone with these features was android the price will drop to almost half iphone user more and yet android phones with double the specs struggle to keep up with it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it doesnt they use sapphire iphone camera lens always been very durable never use more and learn about the difference between lens and lens protector glass
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,preordered this phone and cant wait to use it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is actually good phone but dont buy iphones so dont take my opinion just based on specs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not an apple fan but the arguments below are hilarious still has that ugly notch tha more so mm jack is an outdated standard now okay then
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,anyone who says apple hasnt done good job here is either person filled with envy or more this is common some people hate companiessome people hate their friendrelativeneighbour too for getting success
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,of course cheaper mid range phone can do all the things this phone does for fraction of more dont think phone is showoff for people who are not in your friend circle if it isit has very limited influence sphere of influence over close people only
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,me and my mate upgrades iphone plus her
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats just perceived fastness due to high refresh rate how do you perceive it fast if it is slow
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,just to drop it here in case someone is curious which is faster than the other one and anyway more can you please specify how this advantage is taken of by ios always see that the bionic is waay more powerful to be exploited and even yo bionic will deliver almost the same performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,oh gm
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,on paper sure please watch xperia iii vs iphone speed test youll see whos faster more thats just perceived fastness due to high refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the one at the top of the display on this phone realize apple users are not very tech savvy more mean just because the notch is smaller doesnt mean its ugly unless you do your research to determine which one of the iphone is suitable for your needs if you like big screens id say go for the pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what ugly notch are yall talking about the one at the top of the display on this phone realize apple users are not very tech savvy but id still expect you to understand something this simple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bro you can compare the pro max thats like to every xiaomi mi and up or samsung more bruh your arguments are full of hoaxes you literally created your account just to comment something really stupid like are you out of your mind
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this forum is full of children who know only to read the spec sheet and understand nothing about user experience android snobs that may be the right term for calling those uninformed people
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still has that ugly notch oh shut up trash talker you dont even have clue more save your comment in next few yearsapple will do this mocking for their old iphone year iphone pro max too and you will get excited
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,smaller notch battery hz terabyte enhanced perfect camer nm yup this phone can go through years of use easily just the price point is to much for many users other than that its so good with apple support updates for or years good job
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone is the excellent choice but im referring to the iphone pro because of hz bro you can compare the pro max thats like to every xiaomi mi and up or samsung and even huawei mate pro and these last two are not that expensive and can crush that cmon the only thing iphone has is security and garageband
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post iphone is the excellent choice but im referring to the iphone pro because of hz
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still has that ugly notch what ugly notch are yall talking about
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont spend your money to buy iphone pro max is the same as iphone still ha more not an apple fan but the arguments below are hilarious still has that ugly notch that is correct agree usb lightning usb whatever card slot no it never had such and never will have one video no who need it the video is not great at what left for how many are watching tv glass front gorilla glass or victus the glass is as good as any gorilla glass that is not without its flaws mm jack no who is using this in this outdated standard so your arguments are not valid
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how differs between iphone im really sorry for iphone buyers iphone on smart more apple not force you to buy there products the choice is yours if you like apple buy iphones or buy any other android devices
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,am okay with notch but why tf is it still using lightning port to buy his accessoiry
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well these are just mobile phones not our lives take it as it is no need to fight and argue over android and iphone for smooth experience and many years of software support use iphone for having plenty of options in hardware and skins with ability to push your device to max use android with limited software support expectations at cheaper price use android end of story
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,millions buy android phones and millions buy iphones but im sure you guys here think yo more it is the manufacturer and the shitty influencer blogger youtuber facebooker reviewer twitter that shitting each others each try to alienate each others the manufacturer behind these are more greedy than the average user then this brought much more millions of users shitting each others we shall ban all of them
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,unbelievable wide
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hz lcd display in flagship phone even phone now have hz amoled display its oled not lcd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,correction android phones expect samsung stay smooth over time samsung slows down their phone more no that was apple got big fine for it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,pro pro max have hz displays why do yall always have to say something more my bad did read the specs but somehow missed the data did search for the hz text tho weird anyway finally getting hz
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,those guys are crazy iphone is more way with out hz of refresh what about with according to recent reports they claimed that only one pro model is getting hz this year not the mini or regular which sounds quite interesting but it depends on your preference as normal person to check your research before deciding then come back to the comment section and make complaint
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yea why soo expensive because is battre is weak are serious what are trying to talk about iphone does in keeping battery well and seriously plus mah with go to hell
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,on the arabic stores it shows the iphone pro and pro max would have gb ram on all storage more even apple web site not mentioned about the battery capacity and ram capacity we need to wait for the on hand review for more specs about this device hope september global release for iphone series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this year iphone release is just to cash in as much money as they can as iphone is going to have lots of changes they made little changes this time because they had stock of leftover parts frm the previous phone so guess used in this iphone made little changes but iphone onwards it is going to be lots of changes because already now same design they have made btw lots of great android phones coming within next months personally can tell that samsung galaxy fold experience has been mind blowing although most expensive phone currently it just is the best phone because its blend of phone tablet only android issue is year updates but if they make it years its great deal to switch to android android are best for multitasking like the fold can do so much together what iphone cant because the processor is amazing for multitasking
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im fan of both android and apple and one thing is for sure apple products hold their value more yes apple products are more premium and value is good because of flagship devices comes in year and iphone will get years major updates and years security updates android make more than models each year and years major updates max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post for real trash talker who cares its just design yet it is very good so get over it and move on to it dont care what anyone thinks about this phone it looks decent but you should probably just check your research before deciding its your fault for not doing research opinion is an opinion
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,oh again apple iphone once again
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post yea why soo expensive because is battre is weak
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,he is right you know more like he is wrong you know seriously stop with the false informations and get over to the point
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they changed it to gb ram on the arabic stores it shows the iphone pro and pro max would have gb ram on all storage options but sadly gsmarena thought it was mistake so they need to change the memory size to gb ram to make it accurate
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone performance is so fast its funny watch xperia vs iphone speed testyoure welcome
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its funny when this overpriced junk gets released immediately it gets comments when serious phone gets released noone is interested
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,really then how do you explain these informations that are false mean sure you do get th more they changed it to gb ram
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,oh my god pigs can fly apple made phone with display that doesnt cap out at hz yeeeeeee
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,can it at least support charging
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how can the richest company in the world put cheap features on their iconic products respect more
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is not good phone gonna keep my much better really then how do you explain these informations that are false mean sure you do get the gb ram on all storage options but maybe you should probably just check your research before deciding
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple still does not say what battery capacity what does this company play to wait for rev more well according to the leaks roughly mah
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,xiaomi turbo charger iphone no charger included
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it kinda does to be honest everything is fair in love and war and this is world war
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how can trillion dollar company not put touch id on the power button and dedicated cooling more how can the richest company in the world put cheap features on their iconic products respect apple please we dont want to lose our value
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,does it matter you can still install apks it kinda does to be honest
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,somebody update when they verify that this device can last more than hours with average use after iphones had to ground them as pet home devices and picked day battery life since the less than hours battery life was not ideal for my outdoors travel and generally out of house experience in my honest opinion if battery life doesnt improve their fastest mobile chip will mean nothing anyway as we only have few based applications that need more powerful chip than nm dont be lied to that you can fully utilize the transistors of nm if you want to challenge share link with the demo
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ew no google services does it matter you can still install apks
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hey apple you think we are stupid paying same or more for no substantial improvements every year take it from samsung no innovation dollars less price wait you cant then less income will make share price go down
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nope you better try mate pro ew no google services
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,folds and flips are joke made of plastic shit lmao gtfo here haha you dont even have one of them
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,good idea the price will drop down no it doesnt apple discontinues the pro and pro max of the previous year they will keep the iphone only
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gr nothing unusual just brick
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,we dont need to change this design this will remain the best design till
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,camera is great tb of storage gorilla glass protection with ios superb combination camera is great have you got sample
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what makes it so heavy within
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gr
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,that apple just stopped and became zombie when jobs died why dont just name it the same iphone they just learned marketing strategy from intel
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mini led is just for the ipad pro not for the iphone which uses oled displays that gsmarena more yeah you were right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,heyy guys have galaxy note pluswanne upgrade to pro maxwould anyone recommend it as more have the same samsung galaxy note plus really nice phone probably year more to use unfortunately the phone itself start lagging even when reset the battery drop lot for years now cant get day prob half day on energy saving had before few flagship phones from samsung and the note plus for me is the best but yes go for iphone pro max order today for me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bro love how apple actually cares about the environment and not just about making money as proven by how theyre removing plastic from their packaging
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what joke an incremental upgrade that many iphone users will jump at because the latest ios update will probably make their pro max run slow and kill battery life as is always the case when their newest phone comes out
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,whats new
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,every phone has the same design since ay least apple makes use of high quality materials more even though its plastic or glastic its selling like pan cakes by the way you speak you are just fanatic have great day
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hossamalwakeel sep think the only thing was changed is the price the others shape and specifications almo more this has better camera much better display with hz refresh rate better zoom rangethey finally put optical zoom instead of than the predecessor they also said the battery life is better too it also has tb version of itthere might not be many people who would buy it but they did it what dont like is the weight at is heavy phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yup done preordered mine glad you got it so hows the new iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,with that phone apple become one of the best joking comapnies in that weird world
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post what
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple thay dont know to make designs but thay know how to sell their products im an android user but would say that iphones design is very nice kinda compact form factor and very recognizable brand design although you may say that it is thicc but if you think that percentage of that thickness is just the screen that is also inside the frame
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post today on things that didnt happen
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,even if you told people to not buy the pro max theyre still buying it so maybe you more yup done preordered mine
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nice opinions and the argument to keep your phones for years so everyone would like same as we more can you be my godfather hahaha wish have iphone plus in my life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,guys will feel big difference using this phone compared to as general use no but depends on what you do with it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,could phone get anymore boring than this such miniscule changes to previous models am sure you know the company youre taling aboutright
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothing special
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post even if you told people to not buy the pro max theyre still buying it so maybe you should probably just check your research before buying
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they are pretty committed to face id as for the cooling solution idk even if theyre committed to face id they couldve still put touch id on the power button the ipad mini and even midrange smartphones have it so why doesnt the iphone have it im pretty disappointed because was expecting it to come to iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,to all iphone haters heres the story man has wifehe loves his wife infact he lo more this user is reaching sigma chad levels of opinions
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,find nothing special in this pro max no initial upgrade still look like the regular pro max disagree the display panel is oled but this time its hz
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mega pixel in and the phone are very expensive but the iphone is using larger pixel sites using non quad bayer no binning or such where as the quad bayers native pixel sites are usually smaller and still only compute to mpmpetc final images yes those quad bayers can be used in non binning mode to give higher pixel count but usually at cost would rather have larger native pixel sites and just relying on computational photography alone apple and some others still stick to realistic pixel counts larger pixel sites and also use computational processes either way you preference is your preference enjoy what you choose and leave others to enjoy their choices
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bro this design exist only from not and in iphone they introduced infinite display more they all copy each other
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,horrible keep telling yourself that
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,horrible
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its so sad that their fans have been brainwashed into thinking that apple is the ultimat more right theyve been hating every stuff apple releases get it that some people prefer android but then stick to it its simple as that apple is special on their own way and if its not special according to some people then none android company would follow every step apple does
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they shrunk down the notch basically admitting that it looks awful still forces you more giving up is waste of time like come on just go with the iphone if not then leave this site for good everybody hates to agree with your garbage sentence
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,make phones you to see how long you last in the market hahaha its good
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they put something like safemag which is cool but they dont do touch id even though they have it on ipad mini im sure many feel the same touch id would be priority to tech such as safemag
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,belive either the battery will go up little or down little it is apple do not expect more actually according to rumors regarding the pro and pro max yes they might likely be larger to be able to last longer than on the pro and pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,specs lol bro really am not fan of any company just want to speak facts theres more bro this design exist only from not and in iphone they introduced infinite display but you are telling android smartphone moves to the invisible cameraandroid smartphone brands is always copying apple so no one have any rights to blame apple thing different
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,will wait months after iphone get launched and go for iphone pro max good idea the price will drop down
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,differences between iphone pro max and pro max has been added to as for has been added to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no innovative and same design what about android phones all android phones look same only rare camera modules little change if you dont like this iphone then just go and do comment on your favourite phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post its so sad that their fans have been brainwashed into thinking that apple is the ultimate and most superior phone in the market its comments like this which makes us feel like we have something so special in our hands mean for me iphone is just phone among others but android boys always put iphone to pedestial by giving so much attention for it they are just so obsessed about apple and their users so of course it makes feel special why you guys try to prove something all the time it just look very desperate bitter and comical honestly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yet too has to buy separate charger after buying device
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont talk trash explore the specs first then come back to me specs lol bro really am not fan of any company just want to speak facts theres no such thing as innovation here if you say yes then you are blind af and fan same design here since think while other companies are innovating every year right they came with cinematic video thing and thats great right same notch just smaller and that is also futuristic ghz omg finally but last year what you guys were saying that iphone does not need this and that now just look you iphone fans are just bunch of circus smh guys dont waste money one this wait for next year it seems like next years iphone will be interesting as for what heard
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,now its not original concept that interduce by steve jobs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this should have been named pro max not that many upgrades what update are you expecting
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,despite the price fold worth way more than it then how do you explain these prices on gsmarena for the iphone pro max gb is minimal but gb is sweet spot for the fold its really not worth it in other stores compared to samsungs site
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its so rude that they still havent got rid of that ugly notch dont talk trash explore the specs first then come back to me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its not worth thanks god im waiting for my fold dont think so though it is good deal yeah can tell that its not worth the price but gb is sweet spot not to mention the fold
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post so dont talk trash then
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this looks like good phone cant wait for it to release so can see all of its glory on video
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,any phone with the notch looks ugly to mewe need phone without notchto mei will never more android phones had gone beyond the notch and we want apple to do the same with the iphone series
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,dont mean to be rude but my galaxy has better specs except for the soc storage wireless charge and screen refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wether hate phone or dontlas lasna hu get money go buy amif want gb ramgo android ill still buy apple even if they went back to gb ramnotch or no notchas long as ur phone give what wantrelax and flexeven notchless fingerprintmp androids lag sometimesi rest my case
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post actually its only for the cinematic mode feature
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post its only for the prores feature you will still be able to film kfps despite only having gb
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,how they keep making people to buy phone they already have is still misery
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,then the will be obsolete lol and still expensive read the wikipedia article about the list of ios devices first
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why so weird why not lol mah is more than sufficient for the battery life to last as long as the iphone pro max although the iphone pro max is great device with good battery life im assuming it would last through the day with or without single charge you dont really have to worry about the battery being dead however if your battery health stayed at then its good sign but if your battery health is dropped little more than this is the reason to get it replaced
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hahahaha android phones are thousend times beter than this scrap xiaomi samsung asus these more omg this thing is happening since when android even didnt exists thats why you are here android is better not you still are not happy tell the truth dude you can aford any iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its mah source
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why didnt they add touch id on the power button like they did with the ipad mini even midrange phones have this feature
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,would have bought the if they had touch id that is the biggest deal expecially since we still have covid restrictions in places
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,omg
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,more like ss
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no video recording option it seems no fingerprint scanner too low battery capacity obso more you can not record with mp camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no change
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,whoott
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphones are premium and you dont need to compare them to android crap because hahahaha android phones are thousend times beter than this scrap xiaomi samsung asus these are king and superfast phones will never buy iphone anymore
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,very expensive but low specs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wow its so cheap
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,new weight world record in an iphone grs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the only thing thats changed is not to much
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this phone have same as iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,years and still using mp no finger print scanner no usbc fast charging only at more its iphone sells like iphone same design same crappy internals same soc who overheats trotled mess aka aka just new name same made in china sells like apppe product
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone is quite behind in terms of screen refresh rate technology when many androids are already hz and even hz apple is only using hz on the th generation iphone and the design has changed very little
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hmm these features only partially catching up to some android vendors compare to xiaomi ultra released months ago is still loses out on all fronts from display to camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothing impressive here guys lets move onso many other amazing phones out there so many other amazing phones out there yeah buy regular pro instead this never been fan with these huge phones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,better is to buy some bit coins instead of this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,also the old notch bruh samsung and many other companies are already using under screen came more camera under glass is why apple hasnt done it yet its junk tech not clear enough for apple to put it under screen
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ugly design still use notch on generation
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it doesnt relate with the price whats up with tb storage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why is iphone not including radio
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,are you really that dense what you mentioned arent innovative they are at best minor im more calm down its just my opinion on what people are writing here see you took this really seriously so have to explain more many androids looks almost the same experienced enough androids so have rights to say if theyre buggy or not doesnt mean for others im writing just for my experience sony has itself unique and didnt mentioned them in my comment at all actually sony is the few rares that like personally prefer ios because of its ecosystem and because its better for me and my uses yes know they have bugs too but compared to androids they at least are fixing some of issues know lot about phones youre in none position to say if do or dont have great day
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no always on display in pro model
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,okay so yall asked for smaller notch bigger battery hz display and now thats more are you really that dense what you mentioned arent innovative they are at best minor improvements calling androids buggy shows how much you know about phones stop pretending like iphones do not have bugs after an update my dads the battery life was horrid not all androids use puncholes and notches xperia doesnt do not generalize
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothing is impressive about this phone stop pretending like this phone created an evolution more good point
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no usb very upsetting
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,sad that it uses mini led and not amoled think it is oled not microled or mini led
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yall asked for smaller notch bigger battery and hz display now that isnt good what do you else want lol android isnt better at all it doesnt have full day battery either as someone complained how iphone doesnt have all day battery android phones also didnt upgraded that much they all are copying each other with same designs with same middle punch hole camera with same camera system back etc if you dont like apple simple dont comment it go comment about android if you prefer more buggy barely year software support and crazy numbers on paper that doesnt really prove good in real life basis
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wasted effort same as iphone pro max and pro max no fingerprint scanning same camera with very little difference nothing major except of course heavy price in my place which is for gb for iphone pro max samsung fold is cheaper
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,who needs tb phone lol guess people who records prores video
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple only for the rich
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,more than euro and they dont get full day battery sorry but weak
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,same design no fingerprint pass
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is iphone relaunched save your money or buy galaxy ultra or mi ultra
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yeah right but sadly theres no big difference in real world and gaming performance becau more there is big difference if you use the device for some time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,honestly hard to make if you are troll extremely biased or completely lacking knowledge not more wow we have hater here apple its brand not parts producer with your logic samsung manufactures apple chips why samsung own products are way slower than iphone because ingeniering its the apple part other brands are just producers and they dont have access on the logic process of how the parts they produce for apple are working
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im going for this from my iphone pro max the didnt excited me to much this one yes like the new shape that had but what im loving is the bigger battery and stunning camera plus
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,finally high refresh rate but apple should have provided fingerprint scanner and high resolu more nothing is impressive about this phone stop pretending like this phone created an evolution in technology everything we have already seen is just being tweaked here and there
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,also there are sensors and inch super retina xdr oled promotion display on the pro max honestly hard to make if you are troll extremely biased or completely lacking knowledge not even knowing what actual sensor means and sensor size guess you dont even know that iphones use sony sensors but you probably think it is apple sensors bravo
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,idc who sep no fingerprint scanner so have to open my face shield or typing my passcode in public face id
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,seriously
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,here is another crap from apple now have same look same old notch still in more iphones are premium and you dont need to compare them to android crap because
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,insane and just look at the official estimates for battery life while streaming video iphone pro max hours iphone pro hours iphone pro max hours iphone pro hours
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ugly design one of the best design
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what capacity battery for iphone mah
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,performs like an tractor from lol watch this demolish every android device more laughs in samsung ultra
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its and iphone sill come with big notch pathetic
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it has the ancient lighting port lololol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this is funny from apple its like they are running out of ideas so now whats the significant difference with this and pro max maybe battery upgrade and the hz
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothing special old phone is better than this one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no fingerprint scanner no video recording ugly design who tf needs recording like nobody uses that
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yeah and just new processor and better camera and one only new design and its ugly disagree you guys are trash talkers lol just because iphones have the same design doesnt really mean its bad so why dont you guys just stop talking nonsense and move on to the next
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ugly design how so you literally just never owned one yet the specs are great know the design looks ugly but just because iphones have the same design doesnt really mean its ugly unless youre just looking for the same phone that has hz ltpo displays and great battery life
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,pro best design
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,very good and unique
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why this phone looks like cow and performs like an tractor from performs like an tractor from lol watch this demolish every android device in terms of performance
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ugly design yeah and just new processor and better camera and one only new design and its ugly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well done sony applause
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothing new
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,know apple products are always the best but the body of pro max is the same as pro more hi first of all apple products are not always the best you can easily compare it to android second camera megapixels does not determines camera quality its just its resolution and that you are talking of and mp cameras those arent real resolutions they are just widen up to act like it hope this helps
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still no usb not worth the money
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no fingerprint scanner so have to open my face shield or typing my passcode in public
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,this phone should have been called yes thats right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,camera hardware cant even match ultra years old or even older mate pro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nothing special all the feature and looks are same old model aspect something more special looks but now dont go to upgrade
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the phone is really powerful but apple stick with this design for long time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,looks beautiful but just like its predecessors and why must iphones be this heavy they are annoyingly heavy looking at iphone through and now you might aswel just stick to your very minor upgrades could be that apple is running out of ideas
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still no touch id or notch removed again with this nonsense wow lot of criticism that has to do with iphone pro max that are not having variable refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,id better keep my galaxy ultra it is much better how come an expensive phone comes with only face detection
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not impressed its iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what brick brick is your phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is there still lot of restrictions like usb file transfer and etc on iphones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lolwith no leo
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,cool now compare with those with similar processor specs idk maybe flagship android phone flagship android phones never gives you full power of mobile phone reasons they are different companies snap is hot like dragon company like xiaomi sells extremely pricy globally in homeland they sell cheaper everytime every android devices when you buy you say wish had another phone there are lot of reasons
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,sigh apple is still using their cameras abilityjust like other manufacturers which of users only use camera once week or year nobody cares about your photos or video if you shared it in media just watch apple in youtubeit actually was designed for film directors not for common users
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nobody cant say iphone have small bateries because the iphone processor manage the more cool now compare with those with similar processor specs idk maybe flagship android phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what should be the design probably say that it might be identical to the which the has an anti fingerprint coating to prevent the fingerprint while the pro doesnt
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,love you iphone lets support iphone the company created by steve jobs one of the greatest minds of the world and iphone is the only company can counterpart android devices lets support real good phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is unbearable
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the most powerful iphone and the most oldest crap design ever what should be the design
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,decent isnt enough anymore do you understand what im saying said do your research then come back to me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,better wait for iphone instead of buying this you probably should wait for the next one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,unless you are new iphone buyer but dont think if any iphone pro max owner will upgrade to this crap
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,samsung users or some android users or some users who have money to buy an iphone manages to give there opinion about iphone series calling this bad phone bla bla bla let me tell you something iphone is better than all of its predecessors new bionic destroyed upcoming snapdragon and exynos flagahip processors it has better camera new hz display apple manages to improve in every single department so please dont spread false information and guides

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,they wont reveal battery capacity xd lolol must be lower than previous year
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,so to recap more battery life promotion display smaller notch hz thats more for some yes its worth it but others say its not worth it so disagree
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,omg it is very heavy at even my pro max felt heavy will wait till iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im disappointed thats why will stay on my iphone pro max until next year no one cares about your opinion on the iphone pro max it looks just like the which im not saying its bad trash or worse but its not for everyone which it has its pros and cons have you been living under rock or something
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,and the battery is sold separately

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,reallyboring and dated brick design dont care what anyone says about the iphone pro it looks completely fine with hz display on keep spreading false informations that were not even true
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post complete success no
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone pro max they really skipped the name for the iphone pro max which apple claimed that they were not very superstitious to naming numbers first of all they skipped the number for the iphone and second they skipped the name for the iphone or meaning that it should be an enhanced version of it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the notch is still there and no memory card maximum gb ram but is great
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,powerful phone no doubt but is too heavy for everyday use hope next year they find way to make the same thing below
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats an expensive paperweight

Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,small battery noooo thanks small battery how so it will still last more than day some of you have no clue as to reality
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no on display finger print better to wait the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,best iphone we have ever made not like they say this every year
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ok this iphone is beast when it comes to videos well done apple
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,sameold pass
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still only mpxl camera hahaha stingy
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone start
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,next time apple will ask you how to name their tech improvements hahaha next time learn more and be calm before replying mini led lcd is always ips lcd it is the name of technology that this display use but ips lcd not always have mini led so apple cant change the name because it is the technology that is used with this display
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,but iphone is good at bringing quality photos that are nice looking and not over sharpen more yes but it doesnt really mean its bad
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,but the picture quality wont be great and apples image processing isnt as more what are you talking about the quality of the photos do look decent and natural in my opinion they are not that bad just because iphones have the same camera doesnt mean its bad not to mention the photo processing which they used the software to be able to capture decent results if youre wrong about the iphone and still that careless why the hell did it have to do with the picture quality not being good you literally just didnt own one
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bruh iphone is like mercedes gwagon is unique wont expect apple to follow all those trash more so brilliant and new in fact that it will have gb of ram compared to the gb youll get on most phones this price so new that youll still have massive notch that most android phones this price had gotten rid of ages ago so new that youll still get the same megapixel camera that cant capture detail nearly as well as the megapixel androids you can get at this price the only good thing is the processor and even that is nerfed by the fact that you cant download nearly as many apps that you can get on android
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it should have quard cameras what would the fourth one even do
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,someone cant create whith cup but cam create inconstrutive critic about more love iphon pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,will by iphone when he will have zoom and or optical zoom and pro mode
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple has been recycling the iphone every year with some minor changes nothing looks new or more bruh iphone is like mercedes gwagon is unique wont expect apple to follow all those trash android devices
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it is necessary to upgrade never have had too much of an issue with it but it depends on more never was that kind of user who upgrade every year his phone but thnx
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ive been using iphone pro max and will not upgrade yet seems no big changes the fea more im might upgrade for the cameras and for the hz refresh rate love that and better battery life other then that seems the same bro
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the problem is that apple glorifies all of their updates like the whole phone changed but no more thank you exactly
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bruh
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,anyone can spent me this new iphone can give everything
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,megapixil will be not good more megapixil will be good you do realize that its because of larger sensors meaning it could get decent results in terms of lighting conditions
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im user this time must to upgrade to
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no touch id no phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if using iphone pro max no worth upgrading because not much different using pro max from last two years approximately and feel no urge to upgrade yet
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what about the smaller notch ltpo hz display always on display af ultra wide camera big more it might likely be included in that category but heres the correct one that you forgot to put in your category smaller aperture for the telephoto and ultrawide lens meaning that it should be enough light to get decent results
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thought it has indisplay fingerprint they do but unfortunately it was later postponed because face id now works well with mask and all of this crap cause is garbage
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,um always on displaybetter camerabigger batterybetter getc if using iphone pro max no worth upgrading because not much different
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,think with gb ram and mah battery is the best option
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,omg its almost still use bath tub notch screen atleast make it smaller
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the pro max one has lower aperture in its telephoto and ultra wide lenses meaning letting more ah yes these minor upgrades are definitely shelling out for wish yearly phone updates would stop already
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,crisis of innovation yeah cause they dont steal concept from others unique concept always take time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wait is it an hz lcd display it doesnt need to be oled
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if only hardcore apple fans would chill and not buy this trash which is the same with less acc more the problem is that apple glorifies all of their updates like the whole phone changed but nothing really did change did it this time their probably going to say we have firstinclass supersmoothextravisionplus hd max retina display which runs at hz and guarantees you super smooth scrolling and apple fans will be like wow this is so good because they literally only know about apple products and dont know that hz displays are staple on midrange phones nowadays
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no way this will get gb ram id say gb at most apple is known to put less ram on more well they are offering gb in tb variant its obvious people will store large size files in tb variant and you need good ram to move files faster
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not at all it is far better camera wise ram no iphone has had nor gb of ram no iphone ever had gb but iphone pro had na so just wait watchthis is just rumour
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lcd ltpo oled
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,lcd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,some phone with new cpu same phone with better socbetter cameras high end hz mini led instead of midrange hz oled bigger battery with bit faster chargingand maybe forgot other things
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,is it led backlit lcd yes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,android is ram hungry do your research ios is way beyond any android optimisation which is more
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mediocre camera specs bruh you dont really know much about the cameras dont care if its mediocre it could capture some excellent night photos these informations youve claimed are far from being true specs arent even that official
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wow impressive details but not sure bg ram included
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gb ram is so much useless in ios even in android gb is already overkill
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple iphone with gb of ram this is what call unexpected news
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,not convincible for upgrade yes it is just like the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,it is same technology with different name but with dimming zones google it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,fantastic mobile they improved many specs than pro max especially ram storage and battery but no changes in camera than pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,super mobile dream phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its miniled lcd not ips lcd it is same technology with different name
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,pwm flicker green tint black smearing and burn in amoled fanboys wont get that into their more you have problem in your mind there is no issue whith amoled display burn in that is normal thing phone display life isnt forever yeah if you will use the display for very long time you wiil find burn in so if you dont have money and you need phone display life forever so just by cheap device and stop saying pwm flickering is problem that make you be crazy there is dc dimming the fix the problem
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post also they probably skipped the name which was reason for apple to put the name on all iphone models this year so its safe to say that the iphone will not be the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post too late it will be the so you can probably expect the price on the pro models to be the same as the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,base storage should be gb when you consider the launch price of this phone then gb is totally unacceptable
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hope the battery will be better this time same here considering how long it lasts through the day the iphone pro max has large batteries than the current pro max but lets be real it can last through the day without even having to worry about it it was arguably the perfect iphone when it was recently just released before crapvid but if you have the pro max and you want to upgrade to the pro max which it has hz display would say go for it if these upgrades would interest you in
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,please apple take look at the other phones and price my phone is xs max but have also poco and is very good xs max is good too but now not good you must take your mind need to buy iphone ios is good help people to but this new phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,even if we just get the iphone our lives wont really change compared if we get the you can do like of the same stuff on either devices honestly the price does not really justify what you get so in my conclusion can finally afford an iphone xs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,without full screen displayworst phone and also not support hdronly hdr its all full screen which allows more room for screen real estate but likely to be better as for display no all the other iphone supports smart hdr dolby vision and not hdr which helps the job better reason to say worst phone no its still excellent even though its not officially out yet
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post wait for another days for the launch event iphone pro max going to be beast
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gb ram on an iphone is such waste im not fanboy but ios memory management more maybe they need more ram now for new ai processing why do you think you know better than actual manufacturers
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still use nm hipset with little development from series the fallen of apple here we go again with this nonsense listen the chip is an enhanced version of the nm that were used in the iphone which resulted significant improvement over its predecessor but the chip is still an excellent hardware computing system overall there is lot more to like about the iphone pro and pro max which it enables ltpo displays to accommodate an adaptive refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mm headphone jack missing never want to buy this phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ips lcd the next version will have tft remarkable development apple its miniled lcd not ips lcd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im afraid of the tb versions price to be honest dont hate apple butoh no
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,and apple is freeze in megapixel sensor
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,idk but maybe you should change your trash provider dont know but you should change your trash provider you dont really care you literally just repeat the same thing that no one likes to agree which is uncool by the way
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,tb version gb ram will cost usd
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why not gb ram gb ram comes with tb storage option only
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,with hz refresh rate we can know how long their battery would last
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,miniled lcd display thank you apple for removing amoled display with nasty pwm flickering
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hope they fix the trash antenna using pro max idk but maybe you should change your trash provider
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats only your feel man watch speed and gaming test comparison test about iphone on youtube then youll be able to spot out the king
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,why gb ram though why not gb ram
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,whats new same notch
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,good specs all round know people will be happy about the hz display but ditch the gb variant the other less premium ones are the ones that should have gb variants
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still no microsd card and headphone jack
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mp camera pixel size also aperture
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thought they are going to have projector this time
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,bruh this phone sucks apart from the chipset and the camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,infos are wrong they dont use lcd the new pro max will have oled hz displa more yeahsuperfast processor so apple fans can take selfie text their friends tikitok and all the other time wasting apps like an average dollars smartphone can achieve general public dont even know what they are buying except theyre attracted by the appearance or the new colours
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,even taught it will be able to record an video with the rear or front cameras but it see more you call that shaky thing plus its zoomed in no one uses that
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,did you know the reason why apple joined the ram race is because of the tb internal storage more what are you talking about android had tb of storage on few phones since early years so far or lower prices they also had gb of ram for years now they only stop at gb because the tb option is simply unnecessary at the moment and future proof
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,and you think nm is an old chip size
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you dont know much about lenses pixels it has an aperture of this pho more aperture is expected to be included in the main lens so it could capture some excellent night photos thanks to the enhanced version of the nm bionic system on chip it should be in that category for the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,you finally increased the battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im waiting for the full specs of this phone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,kidding me still nm the fallen of apple it is nm and is the most advanced smartphone soc for sure
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,ideas for benchmark pricing how strong is dan
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,apple days are numbered in big boys club
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,im stick with pro max wait for iphone or for more advance upgrade am also sticking with iphone pro max think my next upgrade will be iphone where hope for redesign and better camera
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yeah for ever in your dreams
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,was hoping for some inovationq like video but no video is or even not enough for you the iphone might get though lol
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hope price under
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,wowlooks like good phone but wont pay for it mean have dollar phone which ha more amoled not super amoled
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,if all outdated specs upgrades nobody going to buy next years iphone
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gb gb at most if god bless me will buy iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,doesnt matter ultra still takes better images yeah for ever
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone have bigger battery than vivo and oppo phones this gonna be day battery champ
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,miniled lcd dont believe think its oled screen its just mistake that gsmarena has forgotten to put some extra efforts to this upcoming iphone pro max it will be updated after the official announcement so maybe you should probably just ignore it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no if you have the iphone pro max or xr and you want to upgrade to the pro max would say yes but if it doesnt interest you stick with the
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,still look at the specifications and as hard do try find single reason to buy it cant design if its the same as is terrible camera medium at the best battery good but for price not excellent or best screen lcd really battery charge or my year old huawei charges at ram size terrible memory option very low for upcoming androids starting with gb and going to terabytes internal hdd was expecting something but as usual will wait for samsung or any other phone worth to really change not this
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,useless how about now many need vast memory everyone needs such vast memory to take pictures at high resolution
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,liquid retina
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,amazing camera specifications
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gb of ram this is insane gb gb at most
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,deleted post useless how about now many need vast memory
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,love when people saying that the iphone pro max picture looks just like the iphone pro max but guess what it will be revealed at september th then the picture will be updated after the official announcement dont worry it will have the hz display which could mean that its likely to be featured on the pro models only it might be boring to everyone but truthfully kind of liked it
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,when iphones will not be bendable until you have real bendable glass samsungs expensive benda more literally rollably phone havent released an mans talking about bendable phones unless ur saying about the foldable which are not rollably and ur foldable hasnt even released yet also ios has better ram management cuz oems cant put better ram management even though android is open source meanwhile ios is owned by apple and is not open sourcealso android uses java code which is more hard to get better ram management than the code ios usesi forgot which one and also we arent hating we are pointing out at your beloved apple phone cons
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,its not gonna be called who said that and thats the vanilla iphone thats going ot be
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,nice hope that apple switches to usb soon though
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats iphone pro max picture yes
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,mp with smaller pixel sites which usually means less light gathering efficiency lower nati more doesnt matter ultra still takes better images
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,disappoint me this time will not buy there is no upgrade what am expecting hey but still its apple iphone that is enough am right
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,are you kidding me
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,would be great to have those specs
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,for once learn that megapixels are not the only factors to get good pictures since ultra takes better picture than pro max
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,no more then gb ram that what ios fans say when apple puts more then gb the ios fans wil more when iphones will not be bendable until you have real bendable glass samsungs expensive bendable phones have plastics not glass over their displays you sacrifice too much with these bendable phones ios also has better ram management as well as the apple chips being more powerful than the qualcomm counterparts there are lot of reasons to stick to apples products iphones also dont loose too much value year over year any android phone is worthless after two years dont get haters like you people that just hate apple for no reason
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,gb tb
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,guess this iphone is by far the best and prolly will be the best the camera should have been better but we all know it is apple sobut the bright side is they finally gave hz screen which will be far smoother than many android phones because bionic chipset are super fast but guess ultra or the one upcoming samsung will be total overkill
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what is new
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,oh damn gb jump from
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,waiting for full specifications
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iphone with mah battery thought id never see the day
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,yessss
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,the best smartphone display is coming
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,first iphone pro max details uploaded in gsm arena comes with gb ram good but dont think gb ram coming for iphones
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,thats great butt gb ram is too much
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,what
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,well
Apple,iPhone 13 Pro Max,hmmm
Apple,iPhone 14,can this phone play good quality videos on youtube and other streaming platforms my current phone starts glitching if the quality is higher than
Apple,iPhone 14,so weve all heard the stereotype that iphones are delicate right well let me share little story ive had my iphone for couple of years now this morning in whirlwind of chaos involving crying toddler and rushed attempt to get out the door accidentally left my phone on top of my car yeson top drove off completely unaware rocking very cheap but cute case fast forward bit arrive at my familys house only to be greeted with panicapparently they received an sos alert saying was in an accident and the police had been notified at that moment it all clicked rushed back to the scene of the crime and was lucky enough to meet an amazing police officer who helped me recover both my phone and the case in separate locations miraculously the phone was completely finejust tiny scratch on the bottom camera lens which doesnt even affect photo quality moral of the story iphone certified chaostested
Apple,iPhone 14,how get best photo capture from front or back camera
Apple,iPhone 14,thanks for asistance
Apple,iPhone 14,ive got one myself and use its as our main phone it is absolutely fantastic camera beauti more
Apple,iPhone 14,why this mobile is suposed to be thinner than galaxy but when compaired seems thinner same happen with vs
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone not focus close objects like qr codes dropped in cm water for couple of second and the earpiece was damaged problems with signalsometimes had to put in airplane mode to reconect network to make call
Apple,iPhone 14,hi guis dont know why you most tell camera are great not only on iphone on athers to do more dont really need anything new but the price could be reduced
Apple,iPhone 14,lolthe is literally the same phone as pro aside from slightly less camera but for more it depends on how see it the pro used to be discounted down to just tad more expensive than the obv if ure considering getting it on full price just buy the pro id say worth it bcs of the additional camera hrr and brighter display or like mentioned the which is the exact same phone as with less gpu core also way cheaper
Apple,iPhone 14,id say get the pros and avoid the normal and plus at all cost theyre more lolthe is literally the same phone as pro aside from slightly less camera but for way less money than the pro so no dont go for pro but go for the normal
Apple,iPhone 14,beautiful
Apple,iPhone 14,never had apple iphone was considering to purchase one just so can say lve had one but after reading the comments here decided its not for me and not happeninglm maybe when come back next life they might make something for fair price and everyone is happypeace to you all
Apple,iPhone 14,got iphone pro very heavy and difficult to hang it cant imagine people they have the more take look at the iphone se
Apple,iPhone 14,is the iphone phone yes it is but not automatically if your provider doesnt have then you wont have
Apple,iPhone 14,as someone with an iphone im browsing this comment section to see whether its worth upgra more if you want to upgrade maybe series is just right for you if wanna save alot solid good battery and much modern looking phone tho ipx series battery is terrible and throttle alot
Apple,iPhone 14,based on what youre saying does the iphone pro maxs battery degrade fast im seriously more iphone pro max has one of the best batteries in the flagship market it even outshines the iphone pro max in the battery department dont worry about it the battery is going to last you easily for days
Apple,iPhone 14,this its true im on and dont have intention to upgrade
Apple,iPhone 14,please understand the discussion points before jumping in to defend apple lmao we are talking more based on what youre saying does the iphone pro maxs battery degrade fast im seriously considering upgrading to it
Apple,iPhone 14,why is everyone pretending this year is somehow different because changes between iphone more as someone with an iphone im browsing this comment section to see whether its worth upgrading to or just upgrade to lower version such as pro or my phone still works well but the battery is now shit really liked the battery life of iphone though
Apple,iPhone 14,have tested the digital zoom in store compared it with different phone the digital zo more attest your claim owning the right now coming from galaxy miss the zoom on so god damn much taking clear picture from afar is not popular thing but once you have it you just cant live without it
Apple,iPhone 14,anything above star rating is too high for nonpro iphones in its just way too expensive and poorly specced
Apple,iPhone 14,im not seeing any photo quality improvement from the iphone if anything it has much worse oversharpening effect than the iphone id rather take used iphone instead of brand new iphone
Apple,iPhone 14,the upgrade from iphone to is too minor even someone like me who is always interested more why is everyone pretending this year is somehow different because changes between iphone and were so grand or between and and between and there were bunch of models that never had massive changes how is that problem no one forces you to buy new model every year but for someone still with iphone iphone is big upgrade let alone for people who maybe still have or
Apple,iPhone 14,apple claims it uses standard usb power delivery for its charging with the fairlyold more you do realize usbpd has backwards compatibility just like qc just because it says pd doesnt mean it cant do pd rates wtf
Apple,iPhone 14,naah im good with my this suppose to be iphone for slight improvement
Apple,iPhone 14,nonsense indeed iphone batteries last for years you still see iphones around that are in more please understand the discussion points before jumping in to defend apple lmao we are talking about battery degradation not daily battery life
Apple,iPhone 14,nah sshock just pretend not to understand the only thing he understand well is apple more dont think that hes pretending when people are delusional they really believe things that arent real
Apple,iPhone 14,nice story bro but it didnt happen so stop capping this isnt exactly the first more nonsense indeed iphone batteries last for years you still see iphones around that are in daily use without issues my old iphone is still serving friend gave it to who seems satisfied with it and has not bought new phone to replace it the iphone pro max lasts twice as long as the android flagships so yeah apple has good battery management its why most people like apple to the chagrin of rabid fanboys and trolls
Apple,iPhone 14,they are crap with proof have to disagree ive been diehard android user for years and after finally giving iphones try must say that these days they have excellent battery life my year old iphone with the original battery regularly lasts hours with regular use while only dropping to around no lg samsung or oneplus ive ever used as main device have ever lasted that long
Apple,iPhone 14,at least at camera results comparisons by arenas tests xperia iv simply ko this crap lame devices
Apple,iPhone 14,nonsense the batteries in iphones last really long have iphone with original battery fo more they are crap with proof
Apple,iPhone 14,correction its not good for apples annual bottomline if users taking longer time more nonsense the batteries in iphones last really long have iphone with original battery for four years and the degradation is almost nonexistent it would last at least two more years
Apple,iPhone 14,has just hz display yes but in video playback the pro should go below hz
Apple,iPhone 14,im sure that his point is that higher refresh ratesframe rates are better mean it more nah sshock just pretend not to understand the only thing he understand well is apple good
Apple,iPhone 14,then why not reduce to fps just like films to further reduce the cost no one is uncom more lol dude screen refresh rate and fps are totally different
Apple,iPhone 14,samapple bias dont want to play anymore
Apple,iPhone 14,are you sure about that
Apple,iPhone 14,agree the iphone will be discounted and the only thing thats really different is more the vanilla iphone still ranks fifth in the top bestselling mobile devices in north america the vanilla and se are always the favorites for their price and size its users dont care about things like refresh rate or the like
Apple,iPhone 14,so what is the point of this one is this apples version od flagship killer or upper more many buyers seem to agree with this and went for the pro models instead apple had to reduce production of the and plus due to weak demands who knows selling the same hardware at higher prices wouldnt work out as planned by apple right
Apple,iPhone 14,weird how the regular iphone scores better screen on time for video playback than the pro more has just hz display
Apple,iPhone 14,refresh rate is not the same as framerate im shocked youre trying to bring up as an argument im sure that his point is that higher refresh ratesframe rates are better mean its super obvious but you dont get it
Apple,iPhone 14,if its an solid overall phone why not the only bad thing is too similar with the and peop more the main upgrade of ip is price increases for little improvement like camera improvement from and dynamic island thats itdoesnt deserve star aboveiim not saying ip is not solid btw gsmarena deleted my comment
Apple,iPhone 14,for there is really so much choice almost any android flagship or even iphone pro is possibility
Apple,iPhone 14,you have to admit it was lot of fun those are the comments that cure my depression well will say that minutes perusing the comments section on this site does wonders for how view my own sanity levels
Apple,iPhone 14,you see again one big drama
Apple,iPhone 14,spoken like true sheep exactly what to expect from the resident worshipper other than excus more spoken like true troll why do so many who dont understand apples appeal feel such compunction to flood every review with moronic arguments about why others should not buy the most popular phone on the planet sour grapes or chips on their shoulders
Apple,iPhone 14,yeah id say its likely you would believe such nonsense but that says more about yo more you have to admit it was lot of fun those are the comments that cure my depression
Apple,iPhone 14,but does it really matter no no one is diddling settings menu up and down hours every day more then why not reduce to fps just like films to further reduce the cost no one is uncomfortable while watching film in cinema
Apple,iPhone 14,it is blue iphoneno need to pay extra
Apple,iPhone 14,nothings specialbut waiting for iphone but the regular iphone will be the same except having the chip while the pro models have the lmao
Apple,iPhone 14,blablameh sep but does it really matter yes it does if you dont see the difference then yo more whilst would agree it wouldnt have hurt apples case to have included at least hz display just to match the rest of the market and differentiating spec point from the previous model if for no other real practical benefit your comment about people being blind if they cannot notice difference is absolutely ridiculous barely notice the full hz dude so much so that disabled it on my pro and same again here on the pro reason being is would rather take the minuscule increase in battery life over the minuscule increase in visual smoothness was able to perceive am far from blind though dude as an example am able to read your total bs without issue
Apple,iPhone 14,because its not neccessary correction its not good for apples annual bottomline if users taking longer time to replace battery battery degradation has bigger impact on lower capacity batteries meaning they will drop faster to the magical battery health which is when apple will advise user to replace their codelocked battery at the authorised center at premium cost
Apple,iPhone 14,theres no reason phone at this price point shouldnt at least have hz display but does it really matter no no one is diddling settings menu up and down hours every day going oh thats smooth while rolling eyes backwards no one does that but reviewers for seconds and then the thing is over use hz on my pc for years now and couldnt care less about this on my phone high refresh is nice to have but not something id absolutely demand people often fall in the demand more specs for the money rabbit hole but screen refresh is not really high on priority and people often just harp about this and dismiss bunch of things iphones are really amazing with that personally value way more like absolutely outstanding speakers and taptic engine that are just unmatched by any competition and its something super consistent buy any iphone and youre guaranteed to have these two perform with excellence something so may phones really done terribly in between series for absolutely no logical reason but you cant quantify them like what review measures taptic engine forces or really measure speakers most just throw around subjective remarks like full bass or very loud or full frequency range its just not something anyone can or will brag about with big numbers on paper and we all love android fans love that stuff bigger is always better even if they dont understand any of it
Apple,iPhone 14,why apple hasnt put mah cell already probably waiting for iphone to introduce more because its not neccessary
Apple,iPhone 14,mean it is not bad at all what is bad is the crazy price and screen for the pr more if you compare apple products to chinese brands then youve never owned current apple product and have no clue why people pay for it as for the higher prices look at the crazy high vat and other taxes and sometimes even gouging by nonapple retailers who see higher demand for apple products and rely on it to sell enough
Apple,iPhone 14,price in europe its big con
Apple,iPhone 14,us price okay iphone manufactured in india for base modelwhy
Apple,iPhone 14,why ppl complain about screen just because of refresh rate but ignoring really high ppi and more theres no reason phone at this price point shouldnt at least have hz display
Apple,iPhone 14,deleted post if its an solid overall phone why not the only bad thing is too similar with the and people should buy that one
Apple,iPhone 14,apple iphone review for someone having iphone or iphone definitely not worth it for someone coming from older iphones apple still sells iphone and iphone mini at cheaper prices better options in my opinion think the only reason someone will pick the iphone over the iphone at this prices is if heshe thinks about longevity of software updates being that iphone is newer model but taking into consideration that both are powered by similar chipsets am guessing that software support will finish for both of them in the same year probably years from now
Apple,iPhone 14,deleted post well am not gsmarena person but in this case am in gsmarena side iphone is deserved to that star rating iphone is more than good phone if it is not the best and iphone in general is more than good what make iphone looks bad are the price that not everyone can get the price that make android phones visible choice and the last but least the ios with limited functionality in some contries
Apple,iPhone 14,apple couldve just skipped the regular iphone and priced the plus at for only this year with the way things are currently you can very clearly tell that the pricier pro variants are the better deals even better than they have been in the past the regular iphone took on the role of sacrificial lamb
Apple,iPhone 14,person means apple uses lots of sharpening to make texture better than what you can get out of more iphone shots do not exhibit strong sharpening artifacts like regular upscaleandsharpen digital zoom so believe there is lot more to it balcony patterns and moire do not look better than those on meaning the new processing does not necessarily extract more details than the older one think apple used machine learning to reconstruct edges and reduce blurriness from upscaling some small patterns look weird details have been guessed incorrectly but it is not easy to notice them at first glance apple did good job creating sense of sharpness without resorting too much on excessive edge enhancement
Apple,iPhone 14,for example the last zoom sample image seems to be impressive significantly better than more simple explanation could be that maybe the iphone and iphone images are just bad
Apple,iPhone 14,just found out that at least one zoom photo from the pro review was taken at the same time and approximately at the same distance so have just compared one zoom image from the pro with the in some areas the angular resolution of the pro zoom is just slightly better but in other areas it looks nearly identical and in few areas the iphone zoom even seems to have slightly better angular resolution very surprising
Apple,iPhone 14,no its definitely not sharpening have compared crops the digital zoom really del more person means apple uses lots of sharpening to make texture better than what you can get out of mp
Apple,iPhone 14,and by the way the zoom photos of the dont just have more detail in some images more for example the last zoom sample image seems to be impressive significantly better than the if you compare them at pixel level can see few small details that dont exist at all in the iphone image or in the iphone image
Apple,iPhone 14,mp qb has million pixels with photodiodes each example isocell gn same way mp more you are not going to get from them and mp thats what one would expect but one would also expect that ocl sensors only deliver of the resolution megapixel dual pixel sensor is actually megapixel ocl sensor with dual bayer colour filter array ocl quad pixel sensors have one microlens over four subpixels ocl dual pixel sensors have one microlens over two subpixels
Apple,iPhone 14,no wanted to say that maybe apple has found way to achieve resolution comparable to more it is not comparable to it is just sharpening
Apple,iPhone 14,canon created dual pixel af tech canon has camera with mp and is working on sensors with mo more no wanted to say that maybe apple has found way to achieve resolution comparable to megapixels because it is dual pixel sensor actually this should not be possible due to the microlenses but surprisingly high resolution is possible with quad pixel autofocus sensors asus zenfone
Apple,iPhone 14,the zoom photos surprise me because the iphone doesnt have the megapixel sensor more canon created dual pixel af tech canon has camera with mp and is working on sensors with more than mp any af system can be used at any resolution
Apple,iPhone 14,awful phone apple should just make devices of same size like all with with dual camera gb with triple camera gb with triple camera and periscope gb higher clocked cpugpu
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone can save more than and is same phone
Apple,iPhone 14,standby endurance is almost weaker than iphone
Apple,iPhone 14,so worse than pro for similar price pro is sold at apple stores in many places anyway this crap is gonna be best seller phone on earth in
Apple,iPhone 14,apple new special edition made by recycle items
Apple,iPhone 14,well it was better than was expecting but it is basically the iphone ultimate edition
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone review
Apple,iPhone 14,had it been an android phone it wouldnt have gotten more than stars but since its an iphone gsmarena wont dare rating anything form apple below starts
Apple,iPhone 14,idk jun the display is terrible for the price the image quality is really bad the camera isnt even more are you sure you got an apple iphone and not some counterfeit crap ive got an plus and it kicks ass iphones rule
Apple,iPhone 14,after several months of using my iphone finally discovered reliable method to transfer music and other files directly to the internal storage without being tied to restrictive apps or cloud services at first relied on mega since it allows offline downloads however the main issue with mega is that the files are not saved in the iphones actual storage but within the apps data this means that once you delete the app all the downloaded songs or files disappear as well to make matters worse mega recently introduced limitation any file larger than gb now requires paid subscription that quickly became frustrating and pushed me to search for better alternatives the method found works by using samsung alongside the iphone and the process is much simpler than expected on the android device installed es file manager from there selected the folder or files wanted to transfer tapped on share and then chose quickshare instead of sending the files directly quickshare gives the option to generate either link or qr code once the upload begins notification appears and tapping it reveals the qr code for the transfer on the iphone side all had to do was open the camera app and scan that qr code link appeared instantly on the screen and opened it using my browser in my case brave from the browser the files were available to download one thing noticed is that downloading too many files at once can cause errors so recommend grabbing about files at time for smooth transfers once the downloads finish the files are stored within the iphones files app specifically under bravedownloads at this point its very important to organize them since they are still inside the browsers storage deleting the browser will also erase the files to avoid this created separate folder directly in the files app selected all my downloads and moved them into that folder afterward transferred the entire folder from the browsers download directory into the iphones internal storage this way the files stay permanently on the device safe from accidental loss quickshare does have limitation of gb per day but in practice thats more than enough for music videos or documents you might want to move over overall this method feels like solid workaround that doesnt require cables or thirdparty apps with annoying restrictions
Apple,iPhone 14,cant comment in iphone as ive just bought one but waiting on case and screen protector be more im not too sure what you mean by averaged charge cycles every day and if your plus is still battery health after months then it may be erroneous like on my mums plus shes been using hers since september like have with mine and its still showing battery health which just cant be right mine is down to now and yeah it does seem to drop somewhat faster when fast charging it unfortunately
Apple,iPhone 14,so is your phone now the iphone or still the iphone plus still the plus its one of the best phones imo might get an iphone next year or something well see
Apple,iPhone 14,slow charging may be better for the longterm battery health youve got point for years more so is your phone now the iphone or still the iphone plus
Apple,iPhone 14,my battery is at after months do charge with charger cant comment in iphone as ive just bought one but waiting on case and screen protector before use it however would like to share similar experience months ago bought an iphone plus from refurbishing site with battery health have averaged charge cycles every day over the past months and too still have battery health use apples watt wall charger and generally keep within the window of to state of charge similarly my previous phone motorola android was charged through desktop usb that had ma about watts and the phone lasted me years without battery issues and still use it with mainly as scientific calculator am going to continue low power charging as want to keep this phone long while the direction of fast charging is leading to more heat in charging than before heat kills electronics and degrades batteries fast charge is great for convenience for those who need it or are impatient and great for consumerism profits
Apple,iPhone 14,the display is terrible for the price the image quality is really bad the camera isnt even as good as cheap phones its extremely blurry the battery life is honestly awful and it gets as hot as bomb when charging even have to remove the thin case every time charge it features keep getting restricted with each update and the closed nature of the operating system is genuinely frustrating even though people praise its durability its actually quite fragile the glass back breaks easily and the frames paint scratches very easily its clearly focused on optimizing ios effects rather than the actual apps which makes me laugh every time the words game mode pop up whenever special ingame effect appears like an explosion or fireworks the iphone only realizes whats important when its already too late it freezes for seconds bought it for and at that price you should definitely consider other phones instead
Apple,iPhone 14,the eye shattering product red on this is one of my favorite colors ever is the red colour on the iphone any brighter than previous models or the same have an iphone plus in red but the colours not particularly bright
Apple,iPhone 14,poor battery perfomance and always getting hoti advise you to buy pro
Apple,iPhone 14,really love this phone battery at health after years of owning and iphone is pretty fast and good for normal use and good for games the camera is okay but could be improved especially the zoom length and the camera focus ios is running smoothly no crashes like buying phones from apple because mainly security and privacy and really like face id its really secure and uses lidar which is neat and face mapping and does that in just second and phone unlocks to be honest after years of owning still pretty good just wish the battery could be better camera is overall good and performance is great
Apple,iPhone 14,probably not even extra year of upgrades since the chipset is the pro chipset which relea more this one has gb more ram than the base series half more its quite lot that alone could be factor for the updates especially since now ram on the apple side has gone steadily up that said this is not good phone is way better value
Apple,iPhone 14,tiktok views on tiktok video
Apple,iPhone 14,this is just with nothing new except for more year of updates probably not even extra year of upgrades since the chipset is the pro chipset which released alongside the base so dont think it will even get an extra update
Apple,iPhone 14,the iphone is my first apple device after years of using android the change is noticeab more can you still downgrade this to or from
Apple,iPhone 14,gsmarena in the past you have wrote iphones have tof for biometric now you change it in sl have notice that for all iphones that have face id like etcwhy did you change iphone biometric from tof to sl
Apple,iPhone 14,go buy ip pro instead of ip almost same price
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone pro got the perfect smartphone form factor it do have the same body size as iphone while equipped with larger display due to thinner bezel pro max is simply too heavy and big for most people in pockets especially still dont get why majority still prefer the pro max
Apple,iPhone 14,for me this is the word iphone ever even if the iphone is like nearly not better than the iphone in terms of upgrades at least its sometimes cheaper than the iphone but this is just deepfake it ads gigs of ram which does nothing sinse iphones were already fast plus youre basically getting the iphone pro with the features of the and some features that no ones gonna use like action mode crash detection and satellite sos which no one cares since who will even get lost in the desert or get into car accident with their iphone or record video while its shaking if wanted to do that would straight up just use optical image stabilization this is beyond pathetic upgrade if its even an upgrade at all since its not at least the pro models added usefull things and the iphone se at least upgraded the chipset but all of that is not the worst part because they sacrificed the iphone minis for the plus models even though these plus models were not selling well just like the minis plus theres more demand for mini phones in and the fact that its over hundred dollars more than the iphone which does the same things if you wanna buy the iphone just buy the iphone or mini instead since its mini and mini is the best because small and wont explain myself any further upgrading from the to the is like upgrading from an ipad to the ipad or the new ipad
Apple,iPhone 14,being long time android user decided to own an iphone iphone for the first time after my client trade in his iphone for rm first impression is wow ios have improved ton and are now rich in features and the fluidness of animation which making it satisfying to use camera quality is okayish havent really try out its sensor shift stabilization one of the best phone speaker for its size taptic engine is the goat things that still bugs me and make me not fully switch to ios are not able to sideload apps for no ads youtube spotify file manager system single sim slots sad overall im happy with my decision to buy used and not new as seen many go into debt when they could opt for older used iphone models for half the price have to get used to owning two phone where get best of both world also need to evaluate my expenses recently and not go into debt myself haha
Apple,iPhone 14,bring back the names this really hasnt changed enough since the iphone for new more agree and they shouldnt be released year after like before they should be released halfway through the cycle usually in march
Apple,iPhone 14,the iphone se is worse the iphone is great for those who dont like dynamic island well love the dynamic island and that is why use the iphone pro

Apple,iPhone 14,bezels same like the midrange samsung
Apple,iPhone 14,best in the west good for everything like editinggamingsteaming etc best camera for photoshoot
Apple,iPhone 14,ejoseph jan the aida app is informing that the gpu has cores is that true no it has if it has its possible it could be an iphone but you can look in the settings under general and about
Apple,iPhone 14,show me budget phone with inch screen size and compact body with mm of height and more go for the asus zenfone or zenfone they are the best flagships on the market display and powerful snapdragon chip plus other awesome hardware and specs
Apple,iPhone 14,is this good for videoediting
Apple,iPhone 14,the aida app is informing that the gpu has cores is that true
Apple,iPhone 14,im using this phone since july and works perfectly battery is ok with condition read batteries dont like charging to usually charge to screen in my opinion is enough for gaming or watching films fantastic quality of photos
Apple,iPhone 14,the restrictions on apple phones are ridiculous bluetooth only few ringtones or notifications available for whatsapp etc etc
Apple,iPhone 14,waste of money uselesspoor response of back tap and tap to wake slow with lot of lags touc more you for sure got defective unit or simply posting shit
Apple,iPhone 14,disklike this models existence or maybe because dislike it because the exist lol
Apple,iPhone 14,more than and only usb is it some joke what wire charging power it has
Apple,iPhone 14,apples has hidden planned obsolescence policy bro it force people to buy new iphone who more no bor dont care about the battery issue im still not buying new one not every apple user follows the herd and bro every company wants you to keep buying its not an apple thing
Apple,iPhone 14,wanted to know what makes me to pay more to get the instead of the slight better camera slight more ram slight better gpu more cores but same gpu
Apple,iPhone 14,yes extremely draining even the phone is turned off battery continously draining no issues here no unexpected drains
Apple,iPhone 14,ummm im sure samsung was the first company to introduce variable refresh rate to ph more weve seen such behavior from other hrr phone displays from gsmarena note ultra review
Apple,iPhone 14,with current ios is there really battery issue with the did this just have issues that more have the standard wouldnt say the battery issue has totally gone but am thankful my battery health is no longer degrading as fast as it was went from to in just month thankfully its sat at now for the last month
Apple,iPhone 14,internet using time iphone getting very hot
Apple,iPhone 14,what was the android phone that you had before this iphone motorola edge ultra top notch specs wise android proof that its not only specs that makes good phone
Apple,iPhone 14,everybody says this is not worth it over the however and know this is not popular opinion but think the gb ram together with the other smaller upgrades make so that it makes more sense to pick this over the for more acknowledge could be wrong too its just that guess the extra ram will make big difference in the future
Apple,iPhone 14,smart choice
Apple,iPhone 14,hello all currently iphone user wanted to upgrade iphone fits my budget should push more
Apple,iPhone 14,the variable framerate mode is good idea thankfully apple made it so others will copy this more pretty sure samsung introduced this feature first
Apple,iPhone 14,apple stock falls as eu regulators tighten screws and china bans iphones for government worker more blue bubble be busted meaning didnt get it
Apple,iPhone 14,go for
Apple,iPhone 14,still am using iphone it is in good working condition

Apple,iPhone 14,idk where am the is euros more than the and for extra performance better low lig more bucks more from gigantic price
Apple,iPhone 14,gb ram and better cameras yep think its worth to get the than the vs gb more idk where am the is euros more than the and for extra performance better low light better multitasking and bigger battery bucks more is steal of deal
Apple,iPhone 14,basically something nothing changes compare to iphone core in gpu year update mi more gb ram and better cameras yep think its worth to get the than the vs gb ram is bery noticeable even when you watch iphone speed tests
Apple,iPhone 14,hows the battery life
Apple,iPhone 14,anyone knows one magsafe powerbank but thin like under mm preferable mah andi be free magpowerbank mah
Apple,iPhone 14,srekalkobe jul iphones are good they are reliable and secure android is also good for flexibility and custom more agree have also the same opinion lol
Apple,iPhone 14,love dat ios device
Apple,iPhone 14,switched form androidi was using samsung flagships past years but after using first ios device can say one thing apple is the boss quality security camera brand value smoothness little bit compromises but overall its ok
Apple,iPhone 14,iphones are good they are reliable and secure android is also good for flexibility and customization therefore use both typing with ip tho
Apple,iPhone 14,wise person should choose iphoneover better camera more power more update if price difference between or
Apple,iPhone 14,decent phone very low light looks good switched form plus its feeling better device am wrong or right dont know
Apple,iPhone 14,dont you just love when the same phone is released under different name to get more money for an already huge corporation with billions
Apple,iPhone 14,hz display epic fail
Apple,iPhone 14,has has educate before commenting what he meant is that samsung high ends phones has better battery life
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone is fine phone but could have been euro cheaper for the rest its just fine device
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone ios best new features
Apple,iPhone 14,hooray thats coming out of june on ios
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone series ios ota update for june ok noted that if you wrong will come to you to ask why
Apple,iPhone 14,my friend just bought this and thought it was iphone until he told me its iphone more it looks the same so it must be the same phone
Apple,iPhone 14,this weights as much as iphone plus and its one of the lighter phones released in hope the iphone can reduce that bit pixel is similar size and has good weight
Apple,iPhone 14,if travelling vert very veryvery wirest experience automatically going to its surprice feature
Apple,iPhone 14,yuck apple whatd you do to the iphone
Apple,iPhone 14,great phone especially its size and weight the main camera is great but the front camera in iphone is better because upgraded from to so felt some change
Apple,iPhone 14,battery backup one day
Apple,iPhone 14,im phone fanatic not iphone said phone as im using and much more prefer the more agree with you and think iphone has more fluid system than android the graphical interface is more beautiful making the user experience much more pleasant even the original accessories are more beautiful and well made say this because im designer lol its more expensive but the cost benefit is better even in the resale value you dont lose as much as an android that the price drops absurdly at the moment have samsung because wanted to get to know samsungs system but regretted not having bought an iphone even though it is more expensive you get what you pay for always had motorola my last was moto edge fusion love the almost pure android system but got tired of the few system updates only two and decided to get an because samsung extended it to updates and also because when tested it in the store was surprised because both the design and the system looked very much like the iphone but when using it on daytoday basis realized that it is far from this the system is quite confusing because it is very customizable you end up getting lost in navigation or finding something simple like changing the icon format to round on motorola it was very simple on samsung you have to install themes which comes with lot of things you dont need it samsung tries to push you bunch of apps login to samsung account etc it is really very unpleasant the photo gallery does not allow backup to google account but to microsofts onedrive dont get it some say they like samsung because its very customizable and iphone not but the vast majority of samsungs customization find unnecessary for my use really intend to migrate to iphone someday oh and thanks google translator lol
Apple,iPhone 14,mate had samsung ans battey drained in less than day now have an iphone usin more has really weak battery know that because ive had it for while wanted small compact phone and even dont like samsungs one ui still bought it because there wasnt any alternative for compact flagship android phone ill assume the problem wasnt the battery size itself but really badly optimized and inefficient chipset exynos was better on paper the lets say iphone and but they do it better with almost mah battery size of difference series changed that with introducing qualcomm snapdragon chipsets made by tsmc which are miles better with efficiency then samsungs own chipsets foundry and their exynos so efficiency in series is really good now even for power user im an average or below average user using phone only for browsing youtube spotify watsapp and camera but with could barely hold one day of usage with hours of screen time improved lot in that field but im waiting for pixel because there was rumour that it will be compact with size screen and mm of height cheers
Apple,iPhone 14,you nailed it assume apple fanatics will say that iphones consumes less battery cause of ho more im phone fanatic not iphone said phone as im using and much more prefer the android but was shortly an iphone user too so did you noticed how compact body iphone uses do you really expect mah in there would expect something like mah at best in that body sure galaxy can do it better with its mah of capacity but they have totally different approach in designing internals if you open any iphone model and samsung series and put them side by side you would noticed how its all cramped up tightly in samsungs case they do everything on the limit which is not the case with iphones internals now you could say samsung is pushing the limits there and you be right but that also means that iphone do things more balanced the reasons why they have similar results in autonomy is that android and ios are totally different operative systems and they do their own optimization with hardware in this case iphone will always win because they design their hardware and software together to understand better android phones are playing on the pushing the limits card with their biggest everything but with everything being tighten up like that there is an imminent source of heat and we all know what heat means for our phones and their battery drain its perfectly understanding that people will try to compare iphone with android phones as theyre the same because they are both phones but ios and the fact that apple designs everything in cohesive is miles away from what anyone is doing so how can you compare totally different things well not by the spec sheet alone right because theyre running totally different systems right so it can be compared but only with the final results just my cents cheers
Apple,iPhone 14,liion mah is this joke in all buget phones have mah but iphone still more show me budget phone with inch screen size and compact body with mm of height and mm of width which has mah thanks in advance cheers
Apple,iPhone 14,ur not my pal sorry didnt understand what you mean in your advice as asked before
Apple,iPhone 14,hello mates indeed do need an advice in selection between and iphone ur not my pal
Apple,iPhone 14,didnt say it doesnt mate im not even disputing that the point was they more you are falling for the typical numbers on paper marketing bs if phone comes out with battery of mah or something crazy like that youd probably say wow this is clearly better because apple work in an exclusive os they can optimize parts for whatever battery they want to throw on the reason the iphone is copypasted is the same reason why the porsche has the same shape and engine layout since the because it works best for what they want to achieve with that product the public generally likes it and it is instantly recognizable and distinct like android as much as anyone else and ill admit that the iphone is one of the best allround phones one week ago switched from an android to the iphone do miss some freedoms that the android had but the iphone is better experience overall
Apple,iPhone 14,no not and se bad samsung caught up with chip the galaxy from beat flagship iphone from and iphone from impressive
Apple,iPhone 14,bro apple iphone battery after weeks of owning can last up to days im not lying didnt say it doesnt mate im not even disputing that the point was they have no excuse to not increase the battery capacity on their phones especially this year as samsung has caught up if not overtaken them which is massive improvement and huge deal the fact that apple has smaller batteries and lasts as long is already impressive but they need to increase that significantly as it will provide competition and just imagine what youll get out of it when they finally make their move
Apple,iPhone 14,it doesnt matter you as company have to improve things in your devices and innovate more bro apple iphone battery after weeks of owning can last up to days im not lying
Apple,iPhone 14,bigger camera lens and better photos videos video stabilazation and better preformance
Apple,iPhone 14,hii want to buy new phoneam thinking about between ip or pro maxthey are same price ple more
Apple,iPhone 14,if you battery test them iphone wins every time it doesnt matter you as company have to improve things in your devices and innovate not get stuck in the past like years behind the series has better if not the same battery life as the iphone now so apple just does not compete with samsung in any shape or form iphone better have mah battery otherwise its just another piece of expensive shit theyve copied and pasted since bigger the battery the more you are challenging the competitionindustry to improve as well
Apple,iPhone 14,by the time the gen is used early the will have been out for months already more yeah and might be flop who knows im happy with sd gen
Apple,iPhone 14,im old and can see difference use it for week crazy first thought that too but the moment used hz for more than day felt like so so fast
Apple,iPhone 14,hope the body of next generation taller with inch like iphone exploded the market than more just buy the plus what is your problem
Apple,iPhone 14,basically still the same phone as iphone yeah benchmark is much faster but is still more smartphone innovation has reached an all time low imo and especially blame apple for starting the trend and samsung for literally doing whatever the heck apple does
Apple,iPhone 14,anyone here actually has this phone the front camera is so bad it surely never focuses tr more yours is prob defective
Apple,iPhone 14,promotion for standart models
Apple,iPhone 14,human eyes are too lazy to percieve anything above hz and fps there is absolutely no ne more you can clearly see the difference between frames beyond hz easily after that its diminishing returns but thats another topic and everyone know even my elderly relatives can tell that my hz phone feels way smoother than their old hz phones
Apple,iPhone 14,while the snapdragon gen has dramatically improved upon its predecessors shortcoming more by the time the gen is used early the will have been out for months already and that is rumored to be fabricated on tsmcs new node which will be another dramatic improvement bigger than from to its said that apple bought out all the dont know about if its specific ne or np or whatever for several months so qualcomm will probably only get their hands on with the release of the gen or if they are lucky with the release of gen that will widen the gap even more when apple will not only have an architectural advantage but also nodefabrication advantage
Apple,iPhone 14,yuk you cant go back to after so choppy so smooth the eyes follow so naturally more human eyes are too lazy to percieve anything above hz and fps there is absolutely no need for anything beyond on devices its pretty much just for show and flaunting not function
Apple,iPhone 14,how did you calculate that hz is faster than hz yuk you cant go back to after so choppy so smooth the eyes follow so naturally cant believe this is oh apple for da price
Apple,iPhone 14,then what its still faster than other brands how did you calculate that hz is faster than hz
Apple,iPhone 14,no usb no go
Apple,iPhone 14,live with hz while of us enjoys hz then what its still faster than other brands
Apple,iPhone 14,literally exact same specs as the why buy this if you could get for cheaper or just more im replacing things with one go as wilderness canoe tripper three things carry along with my dslrs are gps when away from cell towers sat phone for emergencies and waterproof camera will have with me in the boat add to that mb load that rivals my dslr at mm and am so far ahead of the game with this phone its like it was made for me
Apple,iPhone 14,you are paying hatd earn money ant not getting product to equal it hertz matters phone more you sure replied to the wrong person lol
Apple,iPhone 14,really not for me since ignore it you care about it hence you are disturbed by it do you more live with hz while of us enjoys hz
Apple,iPhone 14,still miss my nonedge sometimes it was an outstanding phone no great upgrade ever since keep living with the old bezels since there is no upgrade to that
Apple,iPhone 14,so basically this is an iphone repackaged not even close to
Apple,iPhone 14,battery amph is very very low it should have to be mamp then it wont be this thickness will be as thick as paged book
Apple,iPhone 14,please help me out here ive been using the since may ive also been heavy user sometimes having hour average screen time per week my battery health is now my intention is to use this phone at optimal battery capacity for at least three years its had two quick successive drops the first was and recently dont charge with the case onin fact hardly use case also use what do you suggest do do you think good battery monitoring app will help me if it will which do you suggest thanks in advance
Apple,iPhone 14,apple should give hertz display cport three camera dynamic island fast charging atleast watt cport in iphone basic model third party app option it will be value for money phone otherwise no in
Apple,iPhone 14,anyone here knows how to fix the emergency sos thankyou
Apple,iPhone 14,because of the os they work just fine even with gb more ram more battery drain they hav more bought into the more ram more battery drain argument years ago but dont think it holds up because having to reload an app thats been pushed out of memory should use far more energy than an unused extra gb of ram and the more ram the less reloads are needed and the betterfaster the experience as well
Apple,iPhone 14,why do apple flagships still only have gb of ram because of the os they work just fine even with gb more ram more battery drain they have the almost perfect os and have no need to advertise specs just for marketing
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone is great phone but not at this price point am using since last month its size is so ideal not too big not too small display camera batree backup sound look and feel all up to the mark nice phone am happy
Apple,iPhone 14,might get from my workplace kind of smartphones iphone basic not pro samsung more advise against the iphone the chipset is outdated and has no real differences id get the
Apple,iPhone 14,why did you move from plus to iphone think plus is objectively far better phone battery life lowlight video do miss telephoto tho small form factor
Apple,iPhone 14,moved form splus to this sound quality call quality no one can beat apple in display depa more why did you move from plus to iphone think plus is objectively far better phone
Apple,iPhone 14,hello im new iphone owner should put back case for it have silicone case but more the apple leather case has great metal buttons
Apple,iPhone 14,why apple ios gui not changed in past we like new gui from apple please no just fix the existing issues
Apple,iPhone 14,not much of difference to gb ram and theyre sam cine cam is not what everyone requires
Apple,iPhone 14,hi wonder why you chose the sultra to try out rather than the which is about the same more base has shit battery life
Apple,iPhone 14,why android phones always do clear cache clear data and have more repairs on lcd because apple uses flat file system built off unix and doesnt require cache clear
Apple,iPhone 14,why does iphone users always carry power bank about why android phones always do clear cache clear data and have more repairs on lcd
Apple,iPhone 14,well when was about to buy new phone decided to point out the things that were the most more hi wonder why you chose the sultra to try out rather than the which is about the same size as your iphone and also has gorgeous screen would have thought it would be the logical competitor
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone has great market and it gives new design in front side but look likes old one so may more why does iphone users always carry power bank about
Apple,iPhone 14,dear all go through the user reviews of every mobile in gsmarena but for my surprise nobody gives their views on usage of particular mobile or its pros and cons etc for taking decision whether to go for it or not people always talk about the issues which common man cannot understand request everyone to give their experience after using phone and dont give lectures here keeping in view the common man regards
Apple,iPhone 14,cool it has no sim tray though who cares about simtray or what ever ports iphone will have ports
Apple,iPhone 14,buy the it has gigs more ram gb total for running all those ios upgrades apple makes you do cool it has no sim tray though
Apple,iPhone 14,just get the instead of this buy the it has gigs more ram gb total for running all those ios upgrades apple makes you do
Apple,iPhone 14,apple figured things out they understood the people buying the vanilla versions do not under more james people dont update phones every year the performance jump isnt that much difference to justify it like cars major changes happen every years now someone buying an iphone not updating it will get very good performance
Apple,iPhone 14,it good years now smaiphones are part of every day life and android just can not co more how do you work that out when android has more functionality than apple apple phones cant download music files from websites or any video files or anything from websites but android can can stream latest movies for free on my xperia from apps download in the play store apple is limited to itunes all media has to go through there and has to be paid for theres no hz screen on iphone stuck at hz even dollar android has hz haha apple have no memory card slot to expand memory no fast charging if the back glass cracks it cost to fix because apple dont sperate the inner components from the glass but every other phone manufacturer on the planet does the reason for this is apple want to charge you more dollars to fix it iphones also require too much passwords to remember you have to put your password in way more times than android google maps is way better than the apple map so is google assistant siri is inaccurate people think iphone is best because its more popular with the wealthy but that is the sheep effect and laimans not knowing or understanding technology
Apple,iPhone 14,pixels and galaxys are the buggiest worst hardware phones on android atleast flagship more but have been galaxy flagship user and never encountered any bugs with software and used to change phone after or yearsfirst used note after that and now splusgot everytime timely updates and not encountered any problem after os upgrades and even other security updatesafter major updates do factory reset everytime after taking backupso maybe because of this never faced any problem
Apple,iPhone 14,iphones are no doubt good in all terms but saying ur android didnt get any update fo more pixels and galaxys are the buggiest worst hardware phones on android atleast flagship wise they also have to update their phones so much because of the software bugs which they dont end up fixing specially pixels owned pixel pro not anymore my oppo find out performs my partners iphone in basically every aspect was the stone of the st to get android other than pixels and ive not had single software problem or hardware issue get updates every month and half roughly pixels and galaxys are overrated over advertised phones that have way too many issues that are kept quiet by sites like this and media outlets so keep their years of buggy updates means nothing
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone just add gb of ram and call it day good job apple youve outdone yourself once again
Apple,iPhone 14,wrong hz is completely irrelevant in every day use for regular things dont use words lik more if having hz on phone is completely useless as you claim or make it to be and want it to be can you at least explain to us why the iphone pros had it and so does the pros
Apple,iPhone 14,the average selling price will go up more people will choose the pro over the normal one by more you mean kill the iphone which is actually disguised as by releasing the pros
Apple,iPhone 14,still better than any phone under if you truly believe that you are absolutely clueless bro
Apple,iPhone 14,hz screen in phone noice still better than any phone under
Apple,iPhone 14,you can not compare android and iphone apple updates all phones at the same time and with more iphones are no doubt good in all terms but saying ur android didnt get any update for year but that is not the case with brandssamsung and google are best in terms of updates in android worldsamsung is providing os upgrades along with years of security patches and iphones are giving to these are all good phonesin terms of reliability on softwarebut dont take other brands from android they will hardly provide any updates after or years and will not get these updates on time toomaybe year later after its releasesamsung and google phones do provide updates in timeim talking about samsung flagships but dont know about mid rangers
Apple,iPhone 14,type usb iphone incoming but more expensive bet
Apple,iPhone 14,wake up people you see again one big drama
Apple,iPhone 14,yes since its based on their ltpodisplays which the basic iphones dont have still kinda stupid nonltpo androids have always on display in some capacity
Apple,iPhone 14,the iphone got more support than the even though it only had more ram the iphone more and also the iphone and plus were unsupported at the same time even though they had different amounts of ram
Apple,iPhone 14,would it get more updates than iphone the soc is basically the same the iphone got more support than the even though it only had more ram the iphone and got the same support even though they had different chipsets that leads us to the conclusion we dont know
Apple,iPhone 14,apple are going to implement the same strategy for their iphones as they do with their macbook more theyve been doing this for years now but the separation is even worse now in both price and features you either get the heavily overpriced highendphone or the just as overpriced basic phone that doesnt really compete with androids similarly priced phones let alone androids midrangephones
Apple,iPhone 14,absolutely pointless release in europe its mighty expensive now for phone that besides the processor offers less than many midrangephones with android
Apple,iPhone 14,mmmm phone
Apple,iPhone 14,no wifi or modem why bother
Apple,iPhone 14,bought phone yesterday when tried to use my jio sim it was not working
Apple,iPhone 14,and aod think apple did apple and only gave pros aod
Apple,iPhone 14,sure man keep enjoying ur hz while the rest of us keep enjoying better displays dude is quite silly yeah dont know what hz is but they will feel the difference regardless its like saying of people dont know what independent suspension is when talking about cars yeah they dont know but they will feel the difference
Apple,iPhone 14,better buy iphone or pro than this recycled trash literally unless you are crazy about phone photography this phone is not worth the extra money because everything else is basically same
Apple,iPhone 14,so it seems the iphone is not what apple wants you to think it is surprised not me hav more if you dont need super powerful flagship would recommend the galaxy as it has excellent specs for under dollars
Apple,iPhone 14,it will never cease to amaze me that androids half the price of iphones have better specs but more thats because only samsung and motorolayup motorola are the only decent android manufacturer there these days ever since huaweis ban chinese brands have been lukewarm to promote their products in the us xiaomi is not even bothering to release their popular phones to work with us network bands
Apple,iPhone 14,the is no difference between iphone and iphone except the of ram and the rom the user us more vs
Apple,iPhone 14,apple from tech disruptors to price disruptors trailblazers crazy they can hold their market share and grow in some regions like in asia apple phones are like tesla cars medium devices at premium prices no real innovation after good hyped years market crises are affecting many producers hope this is not the new new
Apple,iPhone 14,even usb would be game changer lol
Apple,iPhone 14,hz display in it this some kind of joke from apple for grab motorola neo htz min charge buy ya mom an android
Apple,iPhone 14,when are they gonna release camera and zoom camera iphone iphone has camera zoom camera that also has new bionic microchip
Apple,iPhone 14,again no innovation what so ever old everything this is not iphone its hard to be named iphone plus after iphone apple give the same shit with small and cheaper packaging every year can not believe there is millions ballless looser who buy this shit
Apple,iPhone 14,no one mentioned that iphone comes with gb ram this will give much longer life of ios more yeah they did over and over
Apple,iPhone 14,gb lpddr ram pro cameras except for the telephoto lens cinematic and action mode same more wrong the ultrawide cam isnt the same as pro no af slower aperture also lpddrx
Apple,iPhone 14,you make it so easy for pixel to get higher sellings they should thank you iphone is more but really no one gives for your opinion about pixel vs iphone
Apple,iPhone 14,recycle chip set forget it ridiculous price
Apple,iPhone 14,so iphone and plus are just downgraded versions of iphone with the price hahaha good job apple
Apple,iPhone 14,no mini this time currently on regular and would like smaller phone next upgrade meh mini is the only way forward for now alternatively iphone se is way backward that like as well
Apple,iPhone 14,lol this iphone is basically an iphone with the pros cpu gpu ram and pro more the modem has been upgraded from qualcomm to which is used in
Apple,iPhone 14,long live notchings
Apple,iPhone 14,this shouldnt even exist at all its like an iphone with mild camera upgrade and with better communications it doesnt even have the chip on it
Apple,iPhone 14,hmmm iphone or pro for much less hmm would go for iphone pro over iphone not much difference but better screen and lower price
Apple,iPhone 14,apple provide charger adaptor and earphone
Apple,iPhone 14,the colors are really stunning especially the blue one apple never disappoints
Apple,iPhone 14,phone that is nearly thousand dollars and is nothing else but repackaged version of last more lightning is as reliable as ever for me
Apple,iPhone 14,personally think that it makes huge difference to the fluidity and feel of the whole phone more this is just the iphone refordished
Apple,iPhone 14,have hz refresh rate find it rather useless seriously this hz battle is ridiculous personally think that it makes huge difference to the fluidity and feel of the whole phone from experience but im sure different people perceive things differently its just yet another move by apple to try and upsell people to the pro models
Apple,iPhone 14,yeah kind of annoying the pro models are the ones to get the chip but it is how it is ap more yep they are just handicapping the more budget model to try and upsell people to buy the pro model if they actually want the latest and greatest hardware in their new iphone very shitty move by apple but it what expect of them at this point the and plus are massive flop
Apple,iPhone 14,ill go for the iphone pro than this one both have the same inside the only more and aod
Apple,iPhone 14,it says gb on the specs page hereis that typo as far as know all the iphone range has gb ram was just answering the query about gb ram on iphones
Apple,iPhone 14,literally majority of people agree hz is better on phones then hz and yet here am try more have hz refresh rate find it rather useless seriously this hz battle is ridiculous
Apple,iPhone 14,deleted post please shut up your statement has no sense at all you just look like fanatic troll also android phones can cost even more than your beloved iphone also the normal iphone has no sense same chip same camera as the iphone its basically the normal iphone but smart people like will run to buy it just to say have iphone seriously haha you are ridiculous
Apple,iPhone 14,gb ram is more than enough on ios on android its complete no go these days it says gb on the specs page hereis that typo
Apple,iPhone 14,still gb ramits awful gb ram is more than enough on ios on android its complete no go these days
Apple,iPhone 14,have you ever run out of ram on an iphone or you just fancy numbers let them get the pleasure by moaning about numbers
Apple,iPhone 14,apple should hire designer thought looked like wait ohhhhhhh
Apple,iPhone 14,minimal differences in fluidity while browsing arent relevant its just luxury and eats more literally majority of people agree hz is better on phones then hz and yet here am trying to explain that to you sorry didnt know you know better then majority of people
Apple,iPhone 14,hi use phone only for whatsapp and watch some movie or youtube and sometime will take some more no but something thats better priced if it has to be an iphone get if not get an android
Apple,iPhone 14,great choose pro before release assuming the price would be high when the demand of more would say your pro is better than the iphone anyway
Apple,iPhone 14,worse update on an iphone yet might as well buy an iphone or even iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 14,looks like they are going to use last year pro model main camera sensor for thier next year base iphone like pm sensor to pro sensor to
Apple,iPhone 14,hz is completely relevant on phones in every day use it makes ui social media scrolling more minimal differences in fluidity while browsing arent relevant its just luxury and eats power its not free so no hz is better on phones the only exception is for gaming but whoever plays that seriously on phones has other problems ackshualy hz phone eats less power because of vrr barely and only in edge cases so you barely have point either did people really expect iphone to be revolution didnt typical year evolution nothing else not worth to buy for anyone with newer phone maybe iphone users should look into it everyone else should pass basically they made the notch into pill and made it fancy so its not weird and even more underwhelming thats for the pro though the regular one is actually surprisingly meaningless aside from the bigger screen option
Apple,iPhone 14,waste money buy iphone same spec with iphone better buy iphone plus
Apple,iPhone 14,just compared it to the legendary samsung galaxy edge and realized that the legend has more still miss my nonedge sometimes it was an outstanding phone no great upgrade ever since
Apple,iPhone 14,yup this is an iphone anyway
Apple,iPhone 14,im really happy that im not an apple sheep tim cook was asked about the message experience between cross platform android and ios he arrogantly said buy your mom an iphone rcs message is not their top priority that what he said apple fans follow without questioning and again this is not about whether can afford an iphone or what yes can afford it but choose not to use it because it enslaves the users
Apple,iPhone 14,unimpressed by this the only thing here of any relevence is the larger upgraded main camera sensor from the iphone pros however apart from that its the exact same as the iphone but more expensive poor show apple and hz is pretty poor in for phone costing even more than phone its ment to be replacing
Apple,iPhone 14,oh hello there notch your still alive
Apple,iPhone 14,at least it should be screened phone if you are not giving decent size like iphone mi more agree looks huge still nothing exciting
Apple,iPhone 14,htz big buldging camera and still crappy videos due to no rcs tim wont budge might as well stop making them richer because its apple end of day well never have compatibility with each other so is it worth it
Apple,iPhone 14,so this is actually slightly upgraded iphone why would you buy this instead of an old it doesnt even look different companies claim they do act sustainable producing the same phone twice is not sustainable and really not that smart economically customers can and will compare
Apple,iPhone 14,minus hz display minus better build materials and screen brightness
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone bigger price iphone
Apple,iPhone 14,people still arguing about ram at only noobs will check phone power with ram becaus more ps has worse graphics than genshin lmao btw xd
Apple,iPhone 14,just because only you dont like hz displaysthat doesnt mean that they are not more most people will notice difference between hz and hz even if they dont know what it is that persons argument can be made for chipsets as well oh midrange chips are fast enough for people so no need for high end ones who cares if price tag is stupid apple fanboys in nutshell
Apple,iPhone 14,its outrageous and its getting worse every year no new design for years that more what do you want then
Apple,iPhone 14,apple really just repackaged the and is selling it as lmao
Apple,iPhone 14,this is literally re branded iphone which is basically an iphone which is an iphone lol
Apple,iPhone 14,so iphone pro minus telephoto camera tof sensor iphone what joke minus hz display
Apple,iPhone 14,it has notch on top at least you can have bigger screen now without having to pay over otherwise yes and this only good for people who are on iphone maybe or need the pro camera if they are on otherwise not worth to upgrade edit quoted wrong guy
Apple,iPhone 14,lol bro have even experienced hz its not just for gaming basic scrolling on hz is na more really not for me since ignore it you care about it hence you are disturbed by it do you know what placebo is basically your mind is negative placebo in this case you think it is bad thats why it is for you otherwise you wouldnt care its just psychology and of people dont even care about it go and ask how many people even know what hz is
Apple,iPhone 14,you are either fanboy or seriously underestimating what difference hz and hz is it more wrong hz is completely irrelevant in every day use for regular things dont use words like fanboys just because you dont have valid argument to make hz is overrated nonsense on phones and even for games as its less advantage as you think it is and power hog plus unusable in many games and if you need it that hard get the pro whats the issue iphones are still not for people who cant afford to pay more nothing changed get android if money is factor then hard truth btw have hz and higher since years on my pc relevant there on phones completely overrated hype and nonsense and my condolences for serious gamers that play on phone and need it
Apple,iPhone 14,comments should be transfered to iphone pageguess why
Apple,iPhone 14,main camera is really mpxl it is worse than the selfie camera of other phones
Apple,iPhone 14,apple has sold little new to offer this year that they pushed every single upgrade to the pro more it has notch on top
Apple,iPhone 14,what apple is doing iphone is exactly year old iphone atleast they should provide same main camera as that of pro series mp and hz refresh rate processor also year old
Apple,iPhone 14,the cheapest of the lineup is more that apple leads the industry by setting the price bar high but thats about it some of these features are dissed by the most midrange android phones even some budget phones
Apple,iPhone 14,completely irrevant to of users if not more dude go and use your pc or whatever if you wa more lol bro have even experienced hz its not just for gaming basic scrolling on hz is nauseating
Apple,iPhone 14,poor phone but good camera and video recording
Apple,iPhone 14,time to wait for iphone lol
Apple,iPhone 14,almost no difference from prev year and there were years when apple was
Apple,iPhone 14,pls lets be real here people are still gonna buy this phone regardless of the wrong more the average selling price will go up more people will choose the pro over the normal one by factor even bigger than between the and pro the pro is real respectable upgrade actually but the is just price ladder gap filler to make it easier to move up to the pro by pricing they achieved to slowly push their customers further up last year they managed to kill the iphone by releasing the iphone this year they managed to kill the iphone by releasing the pro
Apple,iPhone 14,
Apple,iPhone 14,this entire thing is joke for this price as it is replica of its predecessor apple fans are always on that apple high and theyll mindlessly buy this phone and apple will get away with it
Apple,iPhone 14,the network info shows only gg signals is the satellitesos capability using standard glte signaling plus perhaps enhanced processing of standard signals
Apple,iPhone 14,iphone iphone gpu core think their se models failed which use to be launched for poor ppl so they now came up with new idea of just polishing older models as newer ones also massive inflation all over world they know iphone pro model arent affordable even for middle class now their battery suck anyway have recently shifted to samsung from iphone and found it way way better in everything than iphone
Apple,iPhone 14,this is ridiculous price bump for the with barely any changes and loads of marketing price of the and have not decreased either with the se going from to have lost respect for apple money hoarders
Apple,iPhone 14,
Apple,iPhone 14,great job apple by selling the exact same phone as last year part for part
Apple,iPhone 14,totally agree with the otherss comments
Apple,iPhone 14,type on iphone series it might get away with lightning this year since the law to enforce ports wont take effect yet and apple is apple
Apple,iPhone 14,hz is joke in phone this entire thing is joke for this price as it is replica of its predecessor
Apple,iPhone 14,just go for the pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,my iphone plus stopped working after months of use it was good till the night the battery percentage was around when go for bed the next when took my and pressed the power button there is no display tried all the troubleshooting methods like switch on charging for some time and force start but none of the options worked so went to the iplanet authorized service center for support they are saying the device is completly down and need to replace the main compnent for which they are asing more than inr completly dissatisfied with the iphone as first time user my year samsung galaxy is still working fine except green line issue and dropped battery capacity and am not heavy game user bought this phone for normal and office use am in confusion to proceed further as dont have warranty why there is hype for this worst iphones regards mouttou
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,iphone plus is very nice handset have two cameras on back which make the phone more beauty also have good diplay size everything soo niceand there are amazing colours in the series specialy midnight oye hoye
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,phone plus having charge backup issue battery issue and ringtone also not loudy and difficult to handle because of size
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,you get much wider choice of phones if you use andriod system and you can download lots of more oh wow but no
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,no plus still better than lineup because it has better thermalheat management easier repairability due to changed internals
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,quite decent battery life but photo quality is just meh very slow wireless charging boring ios
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,what gsmarena drinks best battery life sot in iphone means best battery life hahahaha laugh so hard even my old sot hahahhahaa
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,whats the bottom line plus or pro max budget is not serious problem the trade in will offset that almost
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,very nice battery performance ive usedfor cinematic mode now at fps and action mode is best but not in low light
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,iphone dominant at vs android at yes for you bloatware and adware filled android chinese craps is more suitable
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,why are you so adamant on apple being so dominant because they are hone more iphone dominant at vs android at
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,lolan old phone in new jacket
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,lmao then who is the ultra for who is the fold for who are expensive chinese phones fo more who are expensive chinese phones for well select few is the answer at least according to you that is but for some reason decide to keep their userbase to few select people which makes no sense whatsoever why company like xiaomi would launch themselves onto the global market release as many smartphone models as they can as often as they can and boy do they then purposefully limit their userbase to select few these are the levels of logic we are dealing with though when talking to you though none whatsoever
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,nah tbh the vast majority of iphone users buys it as an outfit and does not know half more lmao then who is the ultra for who is the fold for who are expensive chinese phones for why are you so adamant on apple being so dominant
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,nah tbh the vast majority of iphone users buys it as an outfit and does not know half of its more nah tbh the vast majority of iphone users buys it as an outfit and does not know half of its features neither do vast majority of android users does it come as surprise to you that majority of phone users arent tech people people buy iphones because apple make those features very well which majority of phone users do
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,sales are proof of how much brands spend on marketing and how easy is it to fool people more the market share of android is about for long time
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,sales are proof of how much brands spend on marketing and how easy is it to fool people realm more sales are proof of how much brands spend on marketing and how easy is it to fool people you can fool people once with marketing not to get people buy same brand over and over again that comes from great products and very happy customers android oems dont know how to keep their users happy thats why android users keep jumping to next oem just to find out it wasnt any better that doesnt change until they switch to iphone where they finally tend to stay
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,theres no evidence apple does it better especially when it comes down to the basi more nah tbh the vast majority of iphone users buys it as an outfit and does not know half of its features people are obsessed by appearances and apple products are must especially girls am not saying iphone is bad it is the best or second best every year
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,inferior chinese brands already mentioned they make better phones there more you cant even see the contradiction you present can you on one hand you say inferior chinese brands already mentioned they make better phones which is your opinion and only that yet if somebody counters with their own suddenly you are mentioning the need for evidence theres no evidence apple does it better evidence of what better at what and how seems to me you have made up your mind all well and good but should others feel differently all of sudden you need them to justify why this is the case ultimately dude there is no better there is only user preference yours is for something like xiaomi android running miui mine for example is for an iphone running ios neither of us is wrong in this and neither should try convincing the other that they are just dont go running around stating one is better than the other simply because you say so and then asking for evidence to the contrary hypocritical that is
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,haha so people switching to inferior chinese brands is your dream maybe you are xi and can more ive seen that people like you keep resorting to ad hominems like bruh you cant actually come up with proper arguments
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,you act like an insane person get grip if you say so random pop up anon
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,and should care that you dont know what im talking about because you act like an insane person get grip
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,yes am tune it tomorrow to watch the first episode in all seriousness the idea of more haha so people switching to inferior chinese brands is your dream maybe you are xi and can issue decree but free markets dont work this way why is it that all losers have such strong opinions
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,thats what mentioned earlier current ios looks better than what we had years ago more you realize that miui started out and still is copy of miui which why like it the best of all android customizations except its always been buggy as hell ios is actually great
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,he speaks for himself dont know what youre talking about and should care that you dont know what im talking about because
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,apple could have made this phone the phone of the year only if they added at least hz display now it is such waste
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,correction they are better in your opinion am left wondering why anyone should care though more he speaks for himself dont know what youre talking about
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,id rather use iphone than this
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,they already have realme gt mi pro and zenfone immediately come to mind they are ove more correction they are better in your opinion am left wondering why anyone should care though so speak for your self dude and let the rest think for themselves yeah apple enjoy the success they have as they have made products that have sold in sufficient quantities to enable that success xiaomi and the rest less so so whilst ios might be wanting to be miui in your fantasies back in the real world the likes of xiaomi are wishing and dreaming they had apples success
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,its almost miui the ios icons were iconic and very appealing current icons are more thats what mentioned earlier current ios looks better than what we had years ago but especially since ios it overall feels like weird chinese clone of miui despite ironically being made by an american company
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,well all they need to do is make products compelling enough to tempt away apple customers the more they already have realme gt mi pro and zenfone immediately come to mind they are overall better than most iphones while costing way less money especially the gt but it would have been ideal for the three companies to allow you to configure them with either social media android fork or something like stock aosp
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,ios wants to be miui are you high its almost miui the ios icons were iconic and very appealing current icons are garbage
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,yep you can always build upon similar concepts to make them better and thats what xi more cringe af you honestly believe this stuff you are coming out with or are you attempting satire please tell me its the satire not because its any good not at all but at least could understand what you were trying to accomplish
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,myself as always suppose your on some epic crusade to convert the masses hmm yes am tune it tomorrow to watch the first episode in all seriousness the idea of trillion corporation having this much of an influence on the smartphone market doesnt seem right thats why apples influence needs to be reduced by lot people switching from their phones to xiaomi asus or realme for example would be in winwin situation they get better phones while theyre at it too
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,the interests of whom are you serving myself as always suppose your on some epic crusade to convert the masses hmm
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,you are clearly manipulated sure miui is definitely in need of better ux but otherwise it more ios wants to be miui are you high
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,good ios is awful garbage and it will continue to be until apple decides to open it up more the interests of whom are you serving
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,good ios is awful garbage and it will continue to be until apple decides to open it up more this trend needs to be reversed government policies should be passed to lower apples market share by over unless apple goes open source apple needs to remain niche option but the masses should all have access to open source infrastructure that is not bullied by giant trillion company ios really wishes it was miui ios is garbage because apple locks down its operating system and thinks they know better than their customers do
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,the world obviously disagrees with you stick to your collection of velvet paintings even oil paintins from centuries ago show more details than their photos nothing more ridiculous than this oversharpening techtubers call details
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,good ios is awful garbage and it will continue to be until apple decides to open it up more good ios is awful garbage and it will continue to be until apple decides to open it up you have understood something wrong ios is awesome because apple havent opened it up we all seen with google what openess means huge fragmented mess which cant be fixed theres reason why so few buy android flagship phones anymore and os is main reason of that people want more and more from their smartphones and thats why more and more keep switching to iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,lol thanks for letting the world know that what is considered by many to be the best mobile more oh but ios wishes it was miui didnt you know which is instantly the funniest your likely to read on this site today
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,no clearly something is very wrong bigger display and bigger phones always have better life more not all of them sony always have good battery life even with small batteries xz compact other thing newer iphone use more power and throttle less in golden reviewer video they use over of power compare to pro max which use around power in sustained perfomance this also can lead to reduction of battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,keep crying these are offense to photography if any camera maker was setting cam to more the world obviously disagrees with you stick to your collection of velvet paintings
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,gsmarena you used to include in the alternatives section of your review how the phone compares to its alternative like for example with you get better display but an inferior chipset you get telephoto other cameras are comparable better inferior dropping that kind of comparison lately is making your reviews kind of pointless because most phones are good in isolation read review to see how it stacks up against competition
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,ii find rog no iphone no ios good ios is awful garbage and it will continue to be until apple decides to open it up id go for new pro however especially if it gets lineage os support down the line
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,buying ii find rog are much better deal ii find rog no iphone no ios
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,you lie keep crying these are offense to photography if any camera maker was setting cam to do exactly what they do nobody would buy for serious job
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,no samsung apple and google only you lie
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,non have ios so whats the point of buying these android really isnt for everyone tons of ppl easily switch between ios and android or even use both do
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,really no point in reading phone reviews anymore
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,ill correct you every phone manufacturer does the same no samsung apple and google only
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,the plus is the worst buy in the iphone lineup dont buy this get the pro max brand new even cheaper below it has stainless steel build better screen with hz vs hz and nits vs nits it has telephoto sensor and better ultrawide sensor lidar scanner it does bit hdr which the plus doesnt prores and cinematic mode all things the plus doesnt do youre paying big money and skipping on all these goodies man pro max is better iphone all around why would anyone buy the plus to say they have the more recent model haha
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,while the detail outresolves the sensor oversharpening the whole thing is not the corre more ill correct you every phone manufacturer does the same
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,what will never understand of apple is how can charge for such trashy phone with outdated and out of place specs for premium phone think is better for apple to stop this trashy marketing with low end top prices models because each year it becomes more ridiculous and seeing people buying the base iphones just makes my brain blow away phones you can buy for less than include already better specced pixel pro pro vivo with deals also the pro hugely better deal old xiaomi pro or new pro there is long list lets see what this iphone plus has to compensate the price last gen cpu even if up to task or gen behind cameras and no proper tele no high refresh screen good damn were talking about phone no usb and no jack being the lowmid end of apple despite this yea battery is one of the best but hey cmon for less you can also have an android with same great battery but at much less
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,if anybody buys the iphone plus without considering the iphone pro max theyre an idiot
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,plus has huge display which will affect battery life seems you didnt check the claim plus has bigger screen and much bigger battery so that logic does not apply bigger screen means bigger battery means better battery life that is how it works with iphones nowdays also if you checked the pro max and the pro max both with more battery hungry components they get better browsing time too even the pro is getting better dan that ones has much smaller battery than the plus or the pro max models
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,talktime web browsing video playback is solid for mah battery sot
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,the xiaomi pro is cheaper by and it brings more features to the table the logical opt more how about no would rather use year iphone than that trash
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,look at plus its web browsing time then compare to regular and other pro and more plus has huge display which will affect battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,yes its solid but its not great how is it inaccurate look at plus its web browsing time then compare to regular and other pro and pro yes but not mini models issue is there it should be much higher
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,battery life test done on the gsma website can be inaccurate used to own an iphone pro more yes its solid but its not great how is it inaccurate
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,so longest battery life on an iphone ever is capped
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,oh well guuud luck love your confidence
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,so the clame that its the best battery life on an iphone is wrong well from iphone user pov this is blockbuster battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,battery life is comparatively very poor pretty much expensive even after cutting off lot of more battery life test done on the gsma website can be inaccurate used to own an iphone pro max and the battery was solid but do agree that the lightning port should not be in any new iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,not good batterylife thats too harsh but fully agree it has strangely low web browsing score compared to the pro max and the pro max while having pretty much just as big battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,am actually surprised with things in this review and for the wrong reasons know the screen is locked hz and not the to hz ltpo of the pro max but that much less web browsing time did not expect on the plus then the chip performance it should have been much better than on pro yet it is nearly on par while the pro is smaller strange anyhow the pricing being close too pro max as con is weird because for one that depends where you live and second lot of stores here hicked up the prices of the pro models when they realised people want them because of the high pro euro prices
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,nah am android guy even high end android suffers more than any iphone for starters there more this guy said hacks bro youve never used an android in your life
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,hi which one is better for long term use pm or plus thanks for your kind words pm can long last too depends on you but for safety prefer plus
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,my conclusion is that iphones became long time ago piece of make wise decision and more nah am android guy even high end android suffers more than any iphone for starters theres always hacks going on apps dont always run smoothly switched to iphone and im pleased with it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,and please reintroduce iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,what the refresh rate on iphone plus hz
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,upgraded from an iphone loving the large display smooth operation the battery life is top tier opted for this over the pro max just because it does everything need im not pro user so didnt see the point of buying pro phone when have the same display and battery capabilities for cheaper price
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,comes with large display you gonna love that
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,my mom had this iphone for think year now and im loving how smoooooooth it is literally it updates to ios the only problem is not having the dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,its basically the iphone specs repackaged just bigger screen which is how upgraded me do like the bigger screen and have gotten updates its good phone yea but the sold me the same specs just in bigger screen wish had stayed with my ip now feel like iv been cheated thats no way to do customer yall can think what you want to best wishes
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,which one better iphone plus or iphone pro max consider still same gb ram hz more would pick plus no explanation needed newer soc better display etc
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,very tru thats not true ive used samsung fold side by side with the plus and can tell you prefer the iphone over the samsung hands down iphone does everything it claims and does it without freezing or crashing
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,unnamed sep literally no one cares about plus just go with pro or pro max its not true that nobody cares about the plus absolutely love mine it does everything need it to do plus looks more expensive than it was why spend more money on pro or pro max when the plus is just as capable on the whole may change my tune when get the pro my sis is sending to me but failing that ill have this plus til it completely dies
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,no doubt plus it has better processor longer support for the software better cameras and overall better modems and hardware
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,literally no one cares about plus just go with pro or pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,this phone or new samsung there is no better smartphone maker than apple yet
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,sar omg
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,it seems not alot of people were interested in the plus version of the series the comments here prove it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,so this is the phone that everyone recommends over iphone versions
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,worst phone phones processors are very slow having network issue in india people use it more something very off about your comment face is if youve ever used an iphone you wont be typing this
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,saw it cheap but it may be too big for my hands using se rn
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,seriously considering this phone need secondary phone its between this plus more thats weird jump why not pick pm instead of pm
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,ive owned the regular iphone before and while liked it decided to bite the bullet and get the iphone plus have had no issues with my iphone plus since purchased it from my local cricket wireless store and love the touchscreen liked the feel of the screen of the vanilla iphone however wanted bigger screen so got the iphone plus and love it recommend
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,very high battery heath drop on lots of users yes
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,does the phone has network issue no not at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,hi there want to buy iphone plus interested about the refresh rate on this device more its hz so if you loved using the hz on your then this is not the phone for you either get pro max or wait for the which will come out next week
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,you dont even need highest spec if you are to just do common things so why do you limi more bro update ios in iphone plus what about battery drain issue
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,even have the same question iphone has better battery as it is more optimized than android devices and you can easily find the comparison from youtube however it isnt always the case especially if you are playing heaviest game honestly its not necessary to have highest spec as most people dont need it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,hey guys am from india and currently here the proces of the ultra and iphone plus more even have the same question
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,hello guys am from india and currently here both the ultra and iphone plus are available at identical rates was wondering which one to go for am little wary about the ultras battery issues however am not gamer by any means am freelancer specialising in medical and pharmaceutical research writing so that involves lot of ms office and stuff which one should go for with performance and camera being my top two prorities thanks guys
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,but pro has gb extra ram which help him in future updates and applications they both have the plus is much better option for longevity
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,more ram is always better but its still gonna perform great with gb ram less also fo more but the iphone plus has oled display not lcd
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,go with plus its newer compared to used refurbished pro max plus has really more but pro has gb extra ram which help him in future updates and applications
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,were going to upgrade my mum from iphone plus to either pro max or plus which more go with plus its newer compared to used refurbished pro max plus has really good camera unless you absolutely need zoom camera on pro just go with
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,its heavier than any plusseries iphone before its heavier than the iphone plus at the same size and the weight increase in the standard size model is even bigger from to hope it can be brought down bit in future iterations because it gets quite lot with case and screen protector concerning the pro max that thing is just comical with its even heavier weight and gigantic camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,every contries should ban gb devices if the devices cost more than not saying only more agree its really serious at this point
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,you must be having laugh you cant seriously be comparing an lg phone with an iphone more comparing lg phone with iphone is really joke great people great thinking
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,underdisplay samsung galaxy vs iphone over curveddisplay samsung galaxy ultra vs iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,really find this particular iphone to be complete joke especially when compared to my lg more you must be having laugh you cant seriously be comparing an lg phone with an iphone plus because of the lack of an sd card slot and headphone jack these are features that are virtually obsolete on all modern smartphones so you cant really say that is something that makes the lg better also lg left the phone industry for reason nobody bought their phones anymore coz theyre not very good
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,which to choose between ultra and iphone plus own iphone actually buy neither if you are thinking of buying samsung ultra just get iphone pro max instead
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,the abysmal pricing of this phone is response if it doesnt sell well after all most more apple reduce production of plus for whyof course people are not stupif except who buy that tresh
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,more mp better quality as photographer can say the higher the resolution or megapixels yes it brings in more information when shooting in rawthats the good side but of course its two way street it also brings in the things we dont want as in higher noise shoot always in raw format which also means edit all images in post not sure if people want to do that with their phone photos another thing worth notingthe size of the files with the higher mps they sure take up whole lot of space on your device
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,better with iphone pro max right honestly wont even look at it if im going to spend more than for smartphone get sony in fact thats exactly what did with my xperia iv
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,hello everybody want to switch from android galaxy to ios do you recommend or more think iphone plus should be fine for switching to ios personally switched from base to first time using iphone and the only things am missing are the hz and optical zoom on camera the display is excellent but it will take few days for your eyes to adjust to hz if you are moving from some high refresh rate display phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,another small advice better you buy last year iphone pro max for this same price with more thx
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,tried this unit for month now ups from plus selfie camera is awesome tried it even in low light and its really good
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,it is literally stupid to buy this device im big apple fan and personally carry an more judging by your name youre from serbia im from slovenia and for the first time galaxy phones are more expensive than iphones theyre still both insanely expensive though but samsung is becoming more and more expensive
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,will be buying flagship phone for the first timewhich one should go fori like more iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,got my plus purple yesterday and gave my to my hubz who doest want to let go easily of his plus if your looking for bigger screen bigger battery life higher reso and an upgrade on the ram and you are fan if purple color this phone is just right at the right price the only weird part is the speakers are more bombastic like the speaker more
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,it is ok iphone plus for thanks it ok
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,wow its almost and this phone still has hz useless phone yeah yeah dont buy it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,best camera mobile iphone plus samsung ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,phone this big with mah battery wtf its not even official specs at that time mate
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,my favorite phone but there was no card slot then live with or gb youll likely not fill it up easily
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,only mah for phone this big its not about battery mate it still beats samsung ultra on battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,wow its almost and still people compare useles specs on paper compared to the real more wow its almost and this phone still has hz useless phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,lol what happened to humanz that they wanna have brick on them all the time stop judging weight on specs have handson of them and youll realise its not that heavy at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,meh iphone pro max is cheaper yet better just that it has no satellite feature and no crash detection
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,finally decided to go for the iphone plus which is massive jump for me from the honor battery life is fantastic and the big screen is there wanted to go first for the pro max but its euros more expensive than the plus where live its the best option for someone coming from an older phone and wants good battery life and big screen but doesnt want to pay extra for the pros
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,there are some diffs gsrmarena is right in my opinion the only reason to buy ip more the real reason to get the plus of youre someone who wants the extra screen real estate without having to buy the pro max plan on getting it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,was comparing iphone plus size to the pro max and seems very tiny difference so is it more there are some diffs gsrmarena is right in my opinion the only reason to buy ip plus is the weight
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,big and beautiful display battery timing is awesome overall good device have this iphone always on display
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,specs on plus not bad but id rather go for last years iphone pro max this phone is far too big for my liking went with the pro instead its pretty much the same as this but with one more camera better photo taking and at decent size dont feel like im hurting my fingers reaching the top battery on this phone is better but the pros isnt bad at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,been using iphone plus for week now and think the battery is good it lasts and half day for me doing internet browsing and watching video in most of the day but it still lasts and half day for me so far theres no issues on the phone like freezing and all
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,this looks nice
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,its the display used the iphone uses oled and that is like an old style lightbulb in terms more pro max still beat plus without ltpo
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,dynamic island should be used
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,theres one thing bi dont understand the iphone pro max with hz has much more more its the display used the iphone uses oled and that is like an old style lightbulb in terms of power usage in todays power standards but the iphone pro max uses an ltpo display which allows the phone to lower power usage to that of modern day led light bulb by comparison
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,usually get my iphones year late eg got my when the came out the thing thats putting me off upgrading to series next year is purely that the purple is not right for me feel like deep indigoviolet would look really good but thats just me powder purple just doesnt hit the mark currently have red phone but there arent any particularly stand out colours any more
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,thats factually incorrect all the battery drain tests have proved iphone plus has the long more all the ones youve watched that is
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,wait till next year for type and no it really does not have to match oneplus phones in term more type is not confirmed for the next year bruheven if it does think only pro max model will have it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,iphone has much better battery life than androids with much higher capacity am using more my partners iphone gets easily beaten by my find for endurance and never charge my phone to usually charge to about and its still better battery endurance go close to days without charge if need with about hours screen on time each day also most companies wont do updates that restrict performance to keep decent battery life apple known to do this with samsung aswell so not the best company to rate it too done it multiple times in the past and still do it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,dk about you but my old pro max was still at health after years before sold it it more ive seen my friends complaining about their phones dying too quickly
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,and still their batteries dont last that much dk about you but my old pro max was still at health after years before sold it it easily lasted through day even with health
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,more mp mean more detail this is undeniable so you know nothing about cameras more dude mp is typically pixels if take for example sensor with mp which takes pixels photos get much more information can use of course more pixels dont directly mean better resolution tried out xiaomi pro and it was marginally better than my huawei mate pro but if the mp sensor is of the same quality as mp sensor it will show you much more detail than the mp sensor once compared the iphone pro max mp main camera with my huawei mate pro mp main camera there was poster in long distance with black text on white background on it the iphone gave me some blurred shit with rainbow colors my mate pro gave me an almost readable text with black letters and the white background
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,more mp mean more detail this is undeniable the color accuracy hdr etc are matter of proc more more mp mean more detail this is undeniable so you know nothing about cameras got it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,then buy samsung dont do complain here ah you only like apple fanboy comments or what cant hear this answer anymore whenever someone expresses his criticism he is advised to go to the comment section of his favourite phone the person said that the iphone plus is not worth as it only offers mp dual camera while samsung gives you quad camera with mp main sensor for almost the same price why are you so resistant to criticism do you get money from apple for doing this if not then it isnt worth it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,with iphone releasing this phone in october why in the hell are they boasting mp came more then buy samsung dont do complain here
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,theres something wrong when phone doesnt have hz display while ph more wow its almost and still people compare useles specs on paper compared to the real user experience iphone its full package get over it specs are good for random manufacturers to used them for marketing
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,currently use iphone pro max on ios battery and new iphone ios battery would love to have this phone since the iphone battery life its mediocre at least on ios but the price its insane great device but clearly overpriced
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,iphone with pro battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,youre right since its an iphone nothing will help the battery life lol iphone has much better battery life than androids with much higher capacity am using and samsung plus currently phone lasts more than day easy while have to charge samsung twice everyday
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,this could be the best phone but noticed major issue it is hz have poco and can more they hide it using extremely smooth animations wish could increase the speed of them though
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,still stuck at hz display
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,it doesnt need to be any bigger for it to beat any android flagship out there stop acting lik more youre right since its an iphone nothing will help the battery life lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,this will be discontinued next year iphone iphone pro iphone pro max maybe iphone ultra iphone ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,yeah dont quite get the point of this one yes its cheaper but it isnt exactly cheap is it you pay for flagship but it isnt flagship the flagships in this lineup are pro and pro max so if you pay lot of money and they hold back on features is it really good deal
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,hz refresh rate supported not supported
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,waiting iphone plus with typecgo go go
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,its gonna destroy the competition then worst joke ever
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,its gonna be mah like the pro max its gonna destroy the competition then
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,battery disaster it will be battery disaster phone lol the capacity shown isnt even the actual capacity its mah
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,know that in practice they are different but the spec sheet looks awfully close to the lite from years ago that cost euros
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,yea see the mah issue but im not even there yet think they shouldve called this the max and not plus cause apple gave the vibe max as big and pro as baddest meaning that this should have been the biggest and not the biggest and baddest like the pro maxbut whatever
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,anyone who wants to see accurate specs please watch apple explained youtube channel
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,wtf this phone still using chipset lol is with same cpu better gpu
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,another of these apple jokes it costs just as much as years iphone pro max at least here in europe but is ridiculously poor specced same old soc gb ram poor camera setup and hz panel in for eur gb seriously apple would recommend anybody who considers this phone to rather get last years pro max for actually less money from retailer as of today it is about eur cheaper than the plus on ebay you might could find it also bit cheaper new from private seller its better in basically every aspect for less money
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,only mah confirm its gonna be mah like the pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,why apple so stingy with there battery and charging extauchanet prices shocking to say the le more because people will buy it
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,apple actually going back to less confusing naming scheme
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,here in the uk this now costs the exact same price as last years iphone pro poor show apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,so apple realized the mini wasnt doing well and decided to do the same thing again but more maybe this time the sales of the regular iphone would slightly decreased and the plus one will replace it dunno just projecting mind forecasts based on my logic
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,will easily be the best seller of
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,tim cook so guys today we will unviel iphone which is exactly the same as iphone but this time unlike other times we will not give you even the new chip but rest assured this is the best iphone ever btw this plus strategy is to kill the normal iphone so you guys can give us more money by buying the pro models have fun with your iphone or whatever
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,an iphone plus appeared years later
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,so this iphone plus is the downgraded version of iphone pro max same with iphone just get the iphone propro max from last year youre welcome
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,well comparing the prices in my country this will be about for sure in my country it would be better deal to buy an iphone pro max which still sells here for its still very great device so why not basic models are total waste pro is different story
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,tbh the only exciting thing about this phone is the color
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,screen burn in issue from high refresh oledamoled what are you saying ive had my note ultra since and no burn in issues whatsoever and im using high refresh rate most of the time so if samsung can do that how much the almighty apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,the audacity to not even upgrade the soc we really need some stronger competition in na
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,hz in phone is joke screen burn in issue from high refresh oledamoled
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,why to small battery the chipset is very efficient so you dont have to worry about battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,ill wait iphone pro with higher specifications than these
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,just with same old soup
Apple,iPhone 14 Plus,imagine if they are able to use the iphone pros screen on these and tho that will be the literal best thing ever
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone mini black shark cooler wifi router bumper case no back bitdo controller more what time huh
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,is iphone pro better than iphone pro for selfie photos thanks to autofocus or isn more its better miles better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yeah higher battery specs doesnt usually translate to better and actual endurance log more yes but iphone is so slow due to the updates
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,nice picture
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,so it has mah battery yet the endurance rating is not better than the iphone more yeah higher battery specs doesnt usually translate to better and actual endurance logically the iphone is still the better choice if someones reasoning is based on product value and functionality in terms of battery life the longer the more useful device is also comparing image quality from this phone with lot of midrange phones from to years ago cant see crushing advantage after all its equipped with tiny camera modules sensors and so on
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,how come this iphone with nm chipset and mah is not getting better battery endurance more check antutu and display difference
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,so from the verdict if it had more efficient components and denser battery thats lighter at the same capacity it would be the perfect phone in terms of hardware
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,any reason why apple performs well in video playback web browsing with such small batter more the chips
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,whats with all the comments that iphones dont have file manager it has for couple of yea more ios proper file manager began in ios
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,having you on the team makes huge difference on demand service app development
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apples camera is extremely worrying it shows large details that dont exist see myoutubecomwatchvrbilzeeece at or myoutubecomwatchvhsaklqqets at and this is due to excessive machine learning hope that journalists dont use the iphone cameras
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,um why do you need file manager ive never even used file manager on an android file managers are actually good if you use your device for more than just saving pics and stuffits just easier to go through your file manager seeing everything laid out like dekstop pc easy to sort share keep tabs on etc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,actually look at battery tests dingus ultra is even worse than the ultra yeah youre right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post no your words were tough you will be sued seems your missing more than few cards if you have to be remined what you actually said regarding apple infringing on patents well they hardly hold monopoly in that behavior regarding them resting in peace im sorry to say to you dude but id wager that isnt going to happen in our lifetimes id get straight with that if were you before you lose any more of those cards
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,what reality the ultra has better battery life actually look at battery tests dingus ultra is even worse than the ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,what disappointment in camera department for eur plus closed eco system closed chargi more um why do you need file manager ive never even used file manager on an android
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post what is tough already said can live quite easily without it how would get sued genius have no connection to apple youre missing few cards from your deck if you know what mean pal
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,majority of smartphone users couldnt care less about file manager it also doesnt more hence lack of file manager is one of the ios restrictions mentioned in the cons
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,you dont know what you are missing yes we do file manager it just got mentioned do try to keep up will you in any event it would appear to just not be an important feature to ios users this as evidenced by the lack of frantic hordes of desperate people clambering at the walls of cupertino crying out for the love of god please give us file manager we cant live any longer without file manager see the simple truth is this here in the comments section of this site file manager gets treated like its something you cant live without there is food air water and file managers apparently yet in the real world you how many times hear android users bang on about file managerszip zero never honestly cannot remember single time where any of the people know who use android devices have ever said to me you know what really like about this phone its file manager also when myself had android devices cannot remember thinking how would ever live without the file manager
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,how could os not have file manager or is that an innovation planned for majority of smartphone users couldnt care less about file manager it also doesnt fit to apple philosophy how ios is designed so wouldnt hold my breath waiting that to happen because propably it will never happen
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,thats awesome
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,honestly in this world phone must have lasting battery life and have dual sim
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,would it kill them to change the design little bit no way this gets and half stars why change something which works so well
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hours of web browsing daaaaaamn
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hi my question please if the both physical sim china version and both sim and physical more yes
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,even if all manufacturers are excluding the charger in the box is still conthat got no more truebut rechecked the ultra review to be sureit is not listed as con
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,they wrote soso battery life when in reality the pro not max has better endu more what reality the ultra has better battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,all phones sound fake if you want real sounding speaker get headphones or speaker box tell that to the other guy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,first ois selfie camera in western markets come on gsmarena what about sonys xaxaxa ultra or the htc cant you use your own phone finder tool to check
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,as always there are those who dont have the capacity to understand the value of good de more dont think any manufacturers are going to be replicating that massive round pill shaped hole that takes up of the screen
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,only phone out there worth buying but the price is way too high for many totally here in australia its rrp is which would be around usd and thats without charger nuts
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the resized mp shots to mp shots make huge difference if apple can pull off that kind more well those arent as much of an improvement as it should be from raw images because they still perform significant post processing even in mp raw nevertheless its clearly better than default and comments here seem to unanimously agree so if consumers could strongly voice their preference to these oems and get them to at least output this level of processing instead of current mess out of auto mode it would be great step forward maybe gsmarea and other sites could conduct poll or something to show what people prefer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,think at this point gsmarena can stop adding no charger in the box as con all more as if its great thing
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,if you got money for it get it dont waste your time with rd tier phones life is too more hope tim cook sees this bro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,stars for the plastic where the sim slot should have been or for the seizure the camera ha more other brands have their own issues ultra exynos battery life not fixed and graphical glitches when playing some games ex apex legends xiaomi bugs everywhere
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,as always the most overrated tech ever apple is just fashion brand for conformists as always there are those who dont have the capacity to understand the value of good design good fit and finish and good software many are willing to pay for it and can afford it so the iphone usually sells better than anything else every time an apple product comes out the crowd that lives under rocks comes out to scream and shout how much better life under the rock is
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the people who are going to buy this phone are probably already in the ios ecosystem and may have no idea what else is out there cant see why anyone would switch to ios from android right now
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,pro no notch cons face id is mistake bring back touch id ios always wants you to use apple apps even though it allows to use others and rd party dont work too well ios is too
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,youtuber has compared the megapixel raw files with the canon while the comparison was more smartphone lenses tend to introduce busy distortedlooking bokeh when theres not enough background separation from the subject this has nothing to do with machine learning in fact some mlbased noise reduction algorithms are considered to be vastly superior to traditional ones eg deepprime proraw has its own set of issues such as sharpening and noise reduction directly baked into the file but what youre saying is clearly not one of them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the photo performance is deadon average especially if you watch it through photo comparison more well said so far nothing comes close to ultras leica authentic mode these so called raw photos of ifon pro look and processed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,nice phone but the price is still at the high side
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,because antutu isnt cross platform test while geekbench is it says in antutu official more if you compare geekbench gpu scores compute they also heavily favour exynos cpus for example the xiaomi tpro with the snap reaches points while the galaxy note with exynos reached beating the in some phones and if you go to open cl the dimensity and snap gen are only points apart while the kirin is ranks first being points ahead of the gen just reminder that this is cross platform benchmark geekbench and do not fully trust it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,see youtubehsaklqqe at and hmmm ok so the take away from that is that the pro main camera doesnt really stand up to dedicated mirroless camera well colour me shocked on that total epiphany the guy actually states how impressed he is with the pro main camera results given its physical limitations so what exactly is your point here
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,see you have link or does this particular youtuber share your preference for anonymity see youtubehsaklqqe at and
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its megapixels so it makes more sense to write instead of see you have link or does this particular youtuber share your preference for anonymity
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,still pictures are not good to be honest too much sharpening and hallowing well we are going to have to agree to disagree on that see as where there is touch too much sharpening going on results are still highly impressive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,im more interested in where this unidentified youtuber found whole extra megapixel its megapixels so it makes more sense to write instead of
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,we did two identical standby tests one with the aod off and another one with the aod more was talking about pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,also battery life on samsung aod used an hour so this hz technology seems like jok more we did two identical standby tests one with the aod off and another one with the aod being always on we captured battery drop in hours for always off and drop for hours for alwayson
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,cant seem to find out from anywhere whether the display is an bit or bit panel
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,my goodness you are from another planet have an iphone pm but also have tried samsungs ov more also battery life on samsung aod used an hour so this hz technology seems like joke pro max aod uses in hours with the whole screen on so how its joke
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the removal of sim card slot is bad thing agree especially if android manufacturers will more only the pro max model has great battery life the battery life of other models is okay
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,bought iphone pro day one currently have battery health then your phone is faulty take it back and get it swapped out for another one have day one iphone pro and my battery is at health
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,not only this apple really covered itself in the hardware department larger main camera se more find it funny when everything is compared to samsung they are the most overhyped media arse kissing android company there is that are mostly fashion trend the galaxy phones have average cameras but good software support and battery even though we know they just cheat benchmarks to post high scores then perform worse than other flagships in real world pixel series being the prime example of this desception which is why they have good battery specially ultra model my old huawei pro from march has same size main sensor and bigger ultra wide than this and samsung plus had an auto focusing selfie cam and periscope telephoto with ois and af pro had an extra telephoto too almost years old now lot of overhyping features on the new iphone line features coming to every android and iphone anyway like emergency sos next year huawei have it on the mate and iphones use qualcomms modem used in android phones and pixel binned sensors which has been thing for years now the removal of sim card slot is very worrying especially if android follow suite not every provider use or have esim capabilities usually only the biggest providers who generally rip you off or push to sell iphones and galaxy phones do and dont think every country even has carrier thay can why such small battery aswell heavy phone with tiny battery android companies can fit smaller cells in to achieve better battery health if thats an issue or to accommodate faster charging while using using better materials for the battery it can be done apple has enough money to research the right tech also why no bit panel yet still hz on base models too really can keep saying about natural tones like samsung do but youre not beating bit or bit panel xiaomi for true natural tones like how gsm like to pick and choose how to promote apples soc performance mean benchmarks dont prove real world anyway so most of its theoretical and theyll praise its geek bench score but hide the antutu scores haha the fact xiaomi beat it in the manhattan too is funny but gsm still spout best soc on the market having bigger die and more transistors than desktop cpus id expect it to be hitting twice the real world performance of any android phone but they dont simple as unless you hardcore game at qhd hz doubt any chip since sd will give you anymore real world performance benefits including the all too powerful for what phones needs at this point the cutout island is terrible theres reason no android oem has done it in what years now companies now will because they know its feature thatll sell phones now urgh also finally aod only about years late to the party and still the worst iteration of aod vs flagships the charging speeds are still beyond awful specially when battery degradation on iphones is probably the worst in the business its joke really dont know any iphone user with good battery after year of use and literal tech enthusiasts saying their iphones battery is noticeably worse after year is pretty poor including iphone pro max apple are known to throttle performance to help maintain decent battery life in ios updates too sorry but think apple is pulling the wool over most iphone users this year which is an task at this point and it doesnt help when gsm are again pandering to the big still iphones galaxies and pixels iphone is better than galaxy and pixel lines but having device that works shouldnt be tech defining like it is in the phone industry my phone always works perfectly only time it doesnt is when using google made apps like youtube gboard or play store which should explain the state of the pixel line was really looking forward to this years iphones aswell but just all fluff from apple and media outlets and yourself drooling over nothing maybe iphone will be the one when all their phones get hz and telephoto cam and finally swapping to type port all their other products do oh wait sorry theyve kept lightning port so you waste more money on cables and dongles like why they removed headphone jack and removed charger from the box
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apple doing what apple does are they overpriced yes but they can get away with it they ha more not only this apple really covered itself in the hardware department larger main camera sensor than samsung brighter display and the usual apple software mean an unparalleled experience samsung has real shopping list on its hands for the ultra im excited for what theyll make if they want to match the iphone in weird way im reminded of when huawei tore ahead of everyone in the camera department if history repeats itself apples gonna start making everyone start making much better phones now bravo bravo its good day for everyone when the standard pro iphone beats samsungs ultra phone in everything apart from pure zoom size and battery and the pro max will address all of these shortcomings apart from the zoom but then again the periscope for future iphones are right around the corner
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,going from the pro to the pro have to say that one week in the battery life not to be more still pictures are not good to be honest too much sharpening and hallowing
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,camera is really bad not flagship level at all even the blue daylight sky is noisy mess
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,it has very good battery life for such small phone even beats the ultra in battery http more going from the pro to the pro have to say that one week in the battery life not to be quite up with the pro im hoping thats just down to some fine tuning needed of ios time will tell that said the results of this video speak for themselves impressive stuff
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post how disgusting nasty and lowlife can people go for the best chance at answering that question ask it whilst looking in mirror
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,what the purpose hiding antutu score of other phone but showing geekbench score of all phone more because antutu isnt cross platform test while geekbench is it says in antutu official website if you want to see real performance just look this genshin impact test video httpsyoutubenkqwohrafu pro max is current genshin champion oh wait iphone is not champs in antutu so showing that score will make iphone look inferior lol yeah its hidden because of guys like you lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,mediocre phone with old features from years ago no wonder apple is always begging samsung in the last few years to create iphones parts with samsung invented technology
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post yeah how can they now read your own last sentence but do it slower the self awareness of people in this place is just hilarious
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,what surprised me the most was actually from jres teardown of vanilla iphone not the more if you can hear anything at all while having your headbox lodged so far up apples suez canalthen they should be some pretty marvelous speakers indeed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,htc has selfie camera with ois so not really first in western markets
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,our endurance rating is the result of combining the power draw from these activities in more here is the flaw the notation system assume that you use your phone only hrs day and that calling people is of real life usage idle and call time screen off represent of the day final notation should compare least hours of use day with web video call and if you do that even the small pro will score very well oddly iphones are historically bad in call standby but with screen on they obliterated the competition for the past years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,people forget that apples silicone is literally physically bigger than qualcomm counterpart thats why it will always be better its like amd threadripper when it first came out people were shocked how it beat intel nonchalantly until they looked at the size of the cpu
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,so many restrictions in ios
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,photonic engine and action mode is not exlusive to the pros it is also available on the and plus
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,those low light main sensor photos look noisy and horrible even the ones with night mode turned off looks much better comparable to xperia iv which has much smaller sensor shame nothing in comparison to ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,to mpx shots are as good as nokia shots sans dynamic range of course which is heaps more hardly as good as even ultras leica authentic mode looks better if you wanna see something as close to as possible look at gsmareas motorola gs mp to mp photo samples those samples are literally the closest thing to pureview that exists of gsmarena httpswwwgsmarenacommotorolamotoggreviewpphp you can compare side by side with samples found in the article where they compared it to mi ultra httpswwwgsmarenacomnokiapureviewvsxiaomimiultracameracomparisonnewsphp
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,likening an iphone to car and that too porsche haha get checked maybe just shows youre the one not knowing either yeah both apple and porsche do small evolutionary changes for everything and they are both really good at it people even hate them both for same tiny changes every year yeah both are almost the same just in different industries
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yes seriously and to that long paragraph yes again long paragraph it was three lines dude
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,awesome that way you can cut your strut whilst rocking smartphone phone in each hand on more always need two phones one for work it comes down to value phone thats double or triple the price needs to be doubly or triply as good likewise galaxy ax model will have poor cameras and poor performance whereas the is decent the pixel is little more expensive in australia but the camera is superior so id choose it over the
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,phandroid seriously might as well counter that with what the likes of imore have to say more yes seriously and to that long paragraph yes again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,it would have been nice to see the unprocessed raw files apple apparently embeds very processed version in the raw file
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,my last android phones had and mah batteries my iphone with half that outlast more are you sure mate are you sure you have used to same clock when measuring those battery time iphone was notorious for not having good battery in particular
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,have iphone which will keep until is out probably thats the difference with androi more using my current android for just over years planning to use it for years more battery still lasts full day with hours of sot since it has mah battery and with gcam with sabre forced it can take pics which will blow any iphone out of the water
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,it is based on other reviews where they compare phone to competition over sharpening over more phandroid seriously might as well counter that with what the likes of imore have to say then just sit back and wait for the cries of apple bias to come flooding in come on dude there is easily more praise coming in for the pro cameras than criticism have been out taking pictures with the dam thing this very day and see no yellow faces white balance or exposure issues in my shots and im not colour blind over sharpening is thing though hoping apple dials that back notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,well said and the runs very well both are garbage though
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,no way it has better stabilization than zenfone and other ones with gimbal
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post my iphone was cheaper than an and out classes it in every way
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,it has the best screen cameras performance speakers and durability not only among the more thats because you have never used one out classes any other flagship by far and have used and owned many
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,my last an droid had mah and it outlasted every single iphone ever own yeah right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,year after year phone makers still waste money on portrait mode same issues always htc and sony should not have started this useless stuff near years ago one more phone here with same nasty habit of blur over body parts and dark contour around subject
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,if only there was no price hike outside us and it had typecthis would be the best compact flagship phoneand the most expensive one obviously the only thing that sucks is the increased weight which is noticable on smaller device more than the bigger max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,and yet thats just your opinion think iphones look nice and so do many porsche cars more likening an iphone to car and that too porsche haha get checked maybe
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post and yet thats just your opinion think iphones look nice and so do many porsche cars and they are both equally stubborn at doing their thing to point they perfected doing their thing
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,remember iphones having non removable batteries right from the start and soon all phones hav more not having removable batteries headphone jack charger in the box is not feature it is con apple is the master of conning their customers and most other companies use apple as an excuse to con their customers too none of this is something to brag about
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,as see it the opinion is split on this feature some people like it some people dont more all the webpages dedicated to phones including gsmarena are not exactly accurate indicators these webpages are used either by iphone users or people who hate iphones its why you have basically split places like youtube are much more neutral because people of all sorts using all kinds of phones float around there
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,pixel costs around now so youd buy of those not for the price of the iphone pro well said and the runs very well
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,looks terrible with that giant notch up there whatever they call it it just is bad sony display is better it has some bezels but the screen is without any cuts
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,know it isnt the pro max but still was expecting better battery life for some re more it has very good battery life for such small phone even beats the ultra in battery httpsyoutubedcfrpxrbc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post faster and more stable than any android ever even year old models are faster than the latest android flagships
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,for those that like to lie on comment session watch the video from pro photographer ton more dont you think it is better to at least spend time on who has studied and worked with it instead of ppl that suddenly decide to be youtuber and review devices by saying the obvious info that even the phones box already show on another day here was post on reddit on randroid someone that had recently got zenfone person called famous youtuber god and saviour before saying super high res on phones is useful try to see the photos on those pro monitors brands like apple dell asus benq make for ppl that work with images do not use tv they are miles behind in quality not even better than current phones you can see how unable to handle high resolution small sensors are you can also keep believing plastic lenses that do not even cost are on pair with those glasses that cost thousands of dollars you know if plastic was any near quality of glass guess you agree that it would be used to make lenses lighter smaller and way cheaper suppose you know some lenses cost over not even the ones from leica yet and majority of them cannot even deal with mp reason new generations of them are made anyway as said before it has been weeks since ive heard pro max was not better than pro max despite the size increase good thing is the fact now apple is trying to make photos less fake still huge job to reach there this means samsung will be doing same in the future because apple is then tech media like verge android authority and some youtubers will suddenly start to love new approach everybody wins
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,two of the new features are software and one is firmware the new processor is plus model of last years so the rating is classic rdf
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,looks one very ugly device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,in comparison if you look at phonearenas poll on the notch on iphone voted for more its poll about the dynamic island feature not the cutout
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,again you can stick to your opinion as stick to mine to me this punch hole doesnt more of course we can have different opinions dont see how what other people think should affect your opinion by the way if you like or dont like the dynamic island and many reviewers dont like or like it so what
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,because im not just hating on apple on gsmarena and never ever look anywhere else react more as see it the opinion is split on this feature some people like it some people dont like it there is poll on phonearena people voted love it and dont like it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,is so tiny by standard
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,every iphone comes with five years of ios updates everybody says years because it is easy to remember half decade but only of them actually got exactly years the the and the later ones got more years and earlier ones got less years the trend is getting more years over time but its not as clear cut as the semiprofessional reviewers picture it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,mr anonymous sep samsungs ultra should also come with gb as base have no preference for brand more dont have any objections for storage size if apple offers up to tb they need to fix the price gap with storage upgrades as its huge difference though
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,id rather buy two pixel as or two galaxy as for the price of one of these pixel costs around now so youd buy of those not for the price of the iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,since before the event there were from china reports of the camera not being better than pr more for those that like to lie on comment session watch the video from pro photographer tony northrup on iphone he mentions that he has tested many phones with qb tech but none of them add quality at full resolution not even from dng files saw tonys iphone pro video while ago and was laughing out of my seriously was genuinely surprised by simply how wrong he is and how he keeps missing mark being photographer doesnt guarantee one to be the most technologically intellectual individual and his video clearly showed me that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post you ifans believe apple is god you apple obsessed android boys make it very hard not to believe you are putting apple on pedestal all the time so you guys make apple feel something very special
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the previous cutout looks better dont like this feature at all because the whole idea more again you can stick to your opinion as stick to mine to me this punch hole doesnt look any worse or better than the notch all things considered its lower but at the same time also narrower and personally dont particularly mind how low or high the pill or the punch hole sits within the notification bar because never watch video on phone anyway the whole reason to use the dynamic island is not to see the ugliness not because you want to use the dynamic island everyone knows this in fact thats the entire point of di it distracts us from the fact that the cutout exists by creating an entire set of features and animations around it and yet the visual trick still seems to be working well for many reviewers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,so is samsungs flagship and it goes up to tb which most phones dont so whats your point samsungs ultra should also come with gb as base have no preference for brand but this review is of an apple device which costs eur here and has nothing to do with samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,raw comparison with the lumia would be interesting
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,keep asking why no android competes against iphone prosnonmax except samsungthat is the perfect size as daily driver for many of whole market actuallys still delivers top class camera butit is way way behind iphone pros battery endurance
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,what are the apls for brightness tests is comes from ish apl or something like
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,honey there is absolutely no one not single one who complained about the display response more oh you mean ms and ms you wish it was and still would be more than compared to even galaxy ultra and all other expensive phones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,in this site all expensive flagship will always get above star rating then the title phone of the year will always be either latest iphone or latest galaxy thats why appreciate more on midrange and entry level phone articles they tend to be more objective and worthy to read than the flagship articles
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,well technically this can go both ways dont you agree mean if someone likes it more yes totally agree with you but you did not write no one likes it understand when people dont like something and its of course totally fine everyone has different taste but writing no one likes it and you mean it seriously is unnecessary also yeah series is too expensive in my country in europe too which is shame iphone is while you can find pro max for for example
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,then tell people to not generalize if someone dislikes then it doesnt mean everyone els more well technically this can go both ways dont you agree mean if someone likes it doesnt mean that everybody likes it for example dont like how it looks in my opinion is even worse design than the notch maybe it has some nice software tweaks but design wise is inferior to the notch yeah the pros feel very premium in the hand but that price increase in europe where live and the fact that they have this dynamic island is no go for me if had to pick an iphone now it will be definitely an iphone pro or pro max even an iphone pro series looks more appealing to me of course the ones in top condition with battery health above
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,your rating are inaccurate the ios alone make any iphone rating under stars aftert years on android and now on ios would never go back
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,literally this was reading so many comments from youtube even social medias and most peopl more lot of my friends and me really dislike the new notch design but it is pretty much given that iphones have lot of the screen wasted so what is the fuss about it is still there now its animated big deal who cares lets move to topics that actually matter and are not purposely named by pr just to drive attention to it as being something new what else is new mean really new what else got improved if you write they moved power button mm down the body do not like you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,shame gb is still not the base
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,dynamic island is loveit or hateit affair sorry but no one like more no one lol how about tell you that very much like dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,lmao
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,camera colour accuracy is abysmal the review says this is on point and the iphone pro ha more it is based on other reviews where they compare phone to competition over sharpening over boosted colors yellow faces and poor white balance exposure are common issues if you like those results good for you even as colorblind can clearly see them and do not like them phandroid makes really nice comparisons in this case being good does not mean being better than competition
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,pretty bad endurance rating my phone do alot better except camera lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,gta will pull on the iphone pro or pro max if apple allowed it you can cloud stream it to the phone have no clue why would someone degrade gaming experience to such level but it is theoretically possible
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,are you using top gears voting approach here you raise the hand and that means of more how do you know that most people like it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,well you do not see reason to complain because gsmarena only measures delta rgb and brightnes more honey there is absolutely no one not single one who complained about the display response time on iphone ms and ms for black to white and to grey respectively they are both good and it is impossible to notice any flaw even when you are playing demanding game reviews say this is the best passively cooled phone for playing genshin impact please stop nitpicking and just accept the reality
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,lol you mean no in czech republic an iphone pro starts at czk about eur more would not mind paying that for new phone if was convinced it is worth that amount of money in this case am certainly not convinced far from it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,xiaomi is at the bottom of the barrel if have to choose chinese phone will pick an oppo more true xiaomi phones have been unappealing in the last year or so not to mention they spam the market with huge number of models how anybody can think that xiaomi plans to follow up all those models with nice software updates its impossible so practically when you are buying midrange or budget xiaomi phone this includes redmi and poco brands is just lottery you might be lucky and end up with nice device or be unlucky and have bad model like in majority of times still will never pay more than eur for phone this includes this overpriced iphone models and not because cant afford it but because the way things are looking right now in the smartphone world no phone is worth that much money also can do other nice stuff with my money instead of spending it on overpriced phones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ancient bt whats newer than bt audio codes bth no one cares for bt version past plus am not sure if they fixed aac encoding with update it was broken for long time on rd party headphones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the low light performance of the ultrawide camera is ridiculously bad just look at the photos on an computer screen even with night mode its much worse than huawei mate pro years ago for examplejust compare the review photo example here on gsmarena and dont know why the revewier didnt realize that respectively mentioned it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,because we know you lot you endlessly whine in every iphone article how everything is wrong more the problem with your reasoning is your assumption its called false premise you reach the conclusion by believing that you know what people will do but actually you dont know that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,seriously the camera shots is awful the photos are over processed doesnt look natural more yes man your nokia luna makes better photos
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,lowering apple sales by over via government laws would be pretty good idea should help silencing apple fanboys who think their company has reinvented sliced bread
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,android users been talking lot about genshin impact like its their somekind of god metric which phone have great performance so now pro max is officially genshin impact god httpsyoutubenkqwohrafu
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,mean obviously youre entitled to your opinion but im stating my impression of more the previous cutout looks better dont like this feature at all because the whole idea of this feature is to hide the ugliness thats so backward if something is ugly you improve it by making it less ugly however apple makes it uglier and tries to hide it only when feature is used the whole reason to use the dynamic island is not to see the ugliness not because you want to use the dynamic island the whole idea is ridiculous
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the dynamic island doesnt solve any problem though its poor attempt to hide th more mean obviously youre entitled to your opinion but im stating my impression of di based on what many people say about it in their reviews the holes cannot be small due to the presence of the faceid sensors which some people tend to forget when discussing di and although it still doesnt look beautiful imo apple did good job making large cutouts less disturbing than it otherwise wouldve been and more seamless if possible id rather not have it and apple should think of way to tuck in all the sensors except for the selfie camera under the display eventually but as for now wouldnt particularly mind even if it was there either thats all im saying
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,dynamic island is very stupid prefer the vanilla iphone its actually clever solution but the size is massive if it was slightly smaller then yes its nice addition
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its all just psychoacoustics harmonics tricking the ear in perceiving lower tones that it act more all phones sound fake if you want real sounding speaker get headphones or speaker box
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,when saw battery life stopped reading most important thing for me it has great battery life for such small phone it even beat ultra httpsyoutubedcfrpxrbc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,same derivative design over generations as opposed to what lets hear your genius engineering solution for featuring the face id system without this approach
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its reasonable battery endurance given its just phone thats no more the battery life is okay at best its far from excellent the battery life of the xperia iv is excellent the xperia iv has screen and the thickness is comparable to that of this phone its unfortunate that the xperia iv uses the though
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,one humiliates any iphone im sure it does its why they are selling millions of them oh wait
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,key findings from the review before the reviews came out argued that the pill doesn more the dynamic island doesnt solve any problem though its poor attempt to hide the super ugly cutout whenever its not used you see the ugliness as it is
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,actually it doesnt sit lower than notch there have been comparisons of both and it appa more this and the fact that gsma took the picture without placing the phones at exactly the same height making the pill look like it sits lower than the notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,they went from mm to mm it is understandable because of the bigger sensor but still they should have retained it with newer lens its also high time they bring switchable aperture now the dof is too thin
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,we will thanks ill never understand people who obsess over notch with such burning more dont know how you reach this conclusion
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,cons no usbc for charging still we cannot use bluetoorh and nfc across all devices on earth lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,years later and they still cannot catch up to the huawei pro in camera quality ouch look at the comparisons in studio low lighting
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,never understood the complaints about the notch my lg had bigger notch that the iphone more actually the bezels of rog and xperia are vertically smaller than pro notch despite housing much larger camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,am blind or is the performance test not in the review anyhow the battery life is solid more its on page just note as the article explains the is the same architecture as the from last year so performance gains are only really from the smaller nm process will allows for higher clock speeds less heat and better power consumption
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,that notch is an eye sore but shills always ready to defend kek
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its about time apple replaced the stainless steel frame with titanium to reduce the weight strong and premium
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,gsmarena forgot to do some research iphone pro superwide equivalent to ff more to add photos of mm of pro are not better they are worse even ones with lower iso look at the castle the blue parts and wall of stones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hi in the page on display it mentions xpx isnt it xpx
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,by the way it seems that the larger sensor apparently cant capture more light than the smaller sensor of the pro in perfect light conditions in lowlight conditions it wont really capture more light due to the worse fnumber but one would have expected more light in perfect light conditions the reason is that the iphone chooses about the same exposure time despite the worse fnumber thats why the lowest iso of the new sensor seems to be instead of the base iso of completely removes the advantage of the larger sensor in perfect light conditions
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the displays brightness is impressive just hope people who are addicted to dark mode and use it even under direct sunlight wont get burn ins its better to use both light mode and dark mode depending on time and your environment it should counter potential burn ins and save battery at night and low light environment
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,really nice phone but think the dynamic island is bit of gimmick in phone this small no mention on the obsolette lightning port
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone we dont talk about notch iphone xs lets hide with the wallpaper in off more we will thanks ill never understand people who obsess over notch with such burning passion all these years of its existence especially since they wouldnt buy an iphone even if it had edge to edge display with underdisplay camera that shoots perfect selfies
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,another point worth mentioning is that while the pill is indeed smaller in terms of the more actually it doesnt sit lower than notch there have been comparisons of both and it apparently sits pixel row lower than old notch you just have perception that it sits lower because its detached from upper display edge and not connected to it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the vivo was the first to have an ois in the selfie camera im surprised gsmarena didnt know that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,and your point is same derivative design over generations
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the quality on the mp raw pics is amazing very natural looking and the videos are absolutely amazing very very great smartphone for media content creation should the pro max have similar battery life as the pro max model then we are before an absolute beast
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,would be interesting to see quadnonaquadx ocl high resolution mode comparisons especially with the megapixel mode of the ultra or with the and megapixel modes of the lenovo motorola edge ultra the high resolution mode of the asus zenfone doesnt seem to be so bad either even though it doesnt have quad bayer but quad pixel autofocus ocl sensor
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the performance is in the review now it seems seems the sustained performance is solid no more saw in golden reviewer video youtube apple now allow over of in sustained perfomance so phones will have better perfomance and less throttle in return battery life wont be as good as series
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,as see in photo compare tool low light scene iphone promax shots look much worse even than xiaomi pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,if you dont want to hear any issue with burn in or other oled issue with pro series after more so iphone base
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,phoneandcarguy aug should my mom get this or the base if you dont want to hear any issue with burn in or other oled issue with pro series after also get if you need usb universal charging or using usb otg
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,whos better basic then pro bro im so confusing pro no confusion its easy win
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,should my mom get this or the base
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,be careful when charging because if you over charge the iphone battery life will start to drain quickly dont heavy use rhe phone my phone was year ago the battery quickly came down to so now the charge is not staying longer period like before my mistake was used this phone for office use gaming too this phone is good for light use if you are planning for long term like me am using it from the phone performace still look good stopped upgrading the software too once battery got poor now am carefully using it everyday so my battery is saved for one year now lately realized how to use lightly am happy at least know the option keep the battery in good shape now
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,can know if that iphone take sim yes but only non american versions
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,how many sot you get after updating to the new os
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,pro is decent choice if you are interested to buy iphone and start using ios system more can know if that iphone take sim
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hello everyone im planning to buy iphone pro in but heard this model has some more go apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,have had pro for over years now and its still amazing im on ios tho battery is on and it still last me day easily locations off most of the time unless have to use it camera is superb probably gonna keep using it for another year maybe even
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,bro the battery is absolute dogshit only good thing is the camera you are wrong my phone bh is and its amazing
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,woow the iphone is working very smoothly games and graphics are so cool am using it from the first bought when it was launched the battery is also super working have battery left after play so many games using for office other work use the single charge for minimum days what product created by apple company
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,after updating my pro display became totally unresponsive to touch any bady facing the issue omg what frustration
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,woow after upgrade phone is very speed the battery drain also stopped new call recording option also available now all the errors in the new version has been fixed am only dissapointed on one thing the new apple inteliigence full features were not given to this one its still good to for no lags or no problems so far the phone is running very smoothly
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,am waiting for update there will be positive updates for the drawbacks in version
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,nobody talks about its horrible weight distribution which makes it feel topheavy and uncomfor more not for me choose it for the weight and design
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its good phone there are some settings we have to set in order to stop battery draining fast
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,please dont be hurry to update to ios because the battery is not good it drains very faster too
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,am afraid to upgrade my phone software which is currently updated had bad good experience updating it heard that some iphone pro users users display goes after updating is it true when was updating its vibration mode stopped working in one update there was issue in signal strength one update phone was restarting more than times after updatingit took long time to switch on after update got afraid so decided to not update my phone ever is it okay if do like this thought that do not want any troubles to my phone

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,wasnt this the phone that was dropped km in the air was there any fault
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,worst battery phone of all times do not buy it do you even own this phone highly doubt it as such baseless comments are usually from haters the battery life is actually much better than apple themselves claim
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,good phone swapped to the se bc im broke but good phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,dynamic island like it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the colour gamut of the camera when it takes photo and video with the iphone pro the colour tone does not represent an apple colour tone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,guys after buying an iphone pro upgrading from iphone regular there is thing that think this phone is lacking is the colour gamut the colour tone iphone pro are more natural white rather than warm yellow since you know most iphone are warmth as far as know and think the colour tone is better on the iphone regular far more than the iphone pro it just the colour doesnot pop up like the series does do you guys agree and you guys have suggestion to fix this colour tonegamut to be warmth yellow again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,wis have this like the black one because it really dark black and buying this this month
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,bought one of these im worried about the battery direction do you think the battery more yes it does
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,while this is good phone and has many capabilities the oled panel is what for me lets it down my iphone screen was brighter produced more lifelike colours and it didnt start to degrade after barely year my pro has developed black dot indicating the display is already starting to break down my is three years old whereas only got my pro last march the only reason that stopped using my alongside my pro is that dropped and smashed it and no longer have apple care on the older device hopefully apple will cover the replacement of my devicescreen on my applecare covered pro if they dont will not be upgrading my device with new iphone at the end of this contract
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the screen cannot open to operate requesting for pas word

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,any experience about update in this iphone pro the new update didnt fix auto wif more you may try to turn off the wifi and bluetooth from setting wifi and setting bluetooth instead of from drop down control center top right corner swipe as the control center only does temporary turn off
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,bought pro months ago and only reason bought it was because got bored of my perfect more same barely use my ip pro its good for photovideography smooth experience os is superb and status symbol as well not an all around phone battery juice sucks the dynamic island ruined my viewing experience like watching netflix or disney that is why need backup android phone and often use it like honor xa and samsung plus its good and practical watching videos and daytoday social activity
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,go with the pro far better camera overall any experience about update in this iphone pro the new update didnt fix auto wifi and bluetooth on every morning
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,guys im currenly social media and content creator and im looking to buy an iphone more go with the pro far better camera overall
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,pro bro pro max obviously
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,my gf has pro and her phone cant last full day she is always in need of charging more you cant compare battery iphone an iphone pro with samsung ultra when you it has smaller battery iphone pro max is the one which has comparable battery to su
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,bought it brandnew one week ago and everything is working great so far ios feels snappy as usual camera works like charm and the battery is very dependable im getting around hours of sot with hours beetwen charges maybe some people should check their habits in terms of techdependancy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,im really looking forward to try the iphone for change it has been long time with android is it worth to pay the extra over the iphone pro is the camera worth not interested to go to the really thanks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,am back to ios after long years so bought iphone pro was never disappointed as more what are you even talking about apple runs the global market for cellphones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the heaviest nonplussized iphone ever and with shape to accommodate feel iphone more no iphone pro will be much lighter than iphone pro because of titanium frame weight according to techreve will be grams grams less than its predecessor
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone pro for me no brainer imho and called this as incher phone on steriod more wanted to stay with android but tried the ultra great performance but way too big and heavy didnt want to use suspenders to keep my pants up with it in my pocket went with pro love my lg thin but the tec is too old all companies are dropping the expandable memory to sell cloud space its hardtofind internal memory larger than gb my lg card is up at gb but will take tb but thats yearold tec will move all my family pict to the pro tb
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,well your samsung edge is very good because my brothers plus already lags and to me nee more youre having lag on tab am having and no lagging at all terrible screen yes excellent battery life and fast charging but no lagging at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,even gb ram of is much much better compare to gb ram of android lol experience first before more iphone needs less ram than android because apple has aggressive task killing and doesnt keep apps in the background for very long android doesnt have more ram because android requires it it works perfectly with gb maybe even less the reason why android phones have massive ram is so you can have large number of apps opened in the background without having to close them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apple fans are victims of psychological warfare and bad influence and hypothesis there is more even gb ram of is much much better compare to gb ram of android lol experience first before ranting
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,have started to doubt gsmarenas battery endurance rating scores and process after usin more bought one of these im worried about the battery direction do you think the battery lasts longer than they talk
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,you really dont the worse phone ive ever had since true
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,can use vidmate or snaptube on this thing vidmate or snaptube the only work on android devices thats one of reasons why only use android love to download very thing love in the internet
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,from what heard ios brings them back here is video found httpsyoutubecsecv more not true
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hate ios it removed live photos from what heard ios brings them back here is video found httpsyoutubecsecvvg so it really seems like ios corrects most of what ios did wrong apart from dropping support for iphone and
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hi all do the charger is also available in it pls confirm if have to buy it separately more if you have to ask you cant afford an iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,im not fan of the camera on this phone the software processing makes images look terrible they are way too oversharpened even in raw
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,that means you bought fake one are you saying they are selling fake
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,totally agree for the camera quality no smartphone can beat real camera if you need good more agree but carry camera is cumbersome and to take an excellent pocture needs skill iphone camera is enough for casual shooting prefer it over dslr due to pocketability
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,can give any suggestion for buying the pro or pro max better iphone pro max because of size better sound and battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,can anyone tell how much less hours of sot or battery life we can get from iphone pro against pro max is it max difference or minor with just or hours
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,deleted post this is not about realme phone it is about iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,plan to upgrade from my old iphone to pro should go for it or waiting for series more upgraded from to pro yes there camera improvements waiting is always like every time get something exta
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,sigh if you are such camera enthusiast go get the real camera instead of getting smartph more totally agree for the camera quality no smartphone can beat real camera if you need good quality photos buy camera instead of smartphone have nikon and the iphone pro and you cant compare both in any situation didnt buy the pro for the camera got it primarily because of my ios apps library and want to keep it for many years as do for all my iphones used my previous one the xs max for more than four years before deciding to switch to the pro the battery has become weak the screen cracked and the speaker not working
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,purchase phone pro last month its totally useless phone experiencing many limitati more that means you bought fake one
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its wise to check both devece in hand am all time apple hater but now am in love with more sigh if you are such camera enthusiast go get the real camera instead of getting smartphone but know most of you arent instead you just go along with their marketing come on bro check your wallet too once while
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,multitasking on screen are you joker common bro in iphone when use facebook cant see you tube at time whatsapp single task single time why wish to consume multiple app at time which is possible in android let me know the way to to do this in iphone learn to appreciate ios is better in many regards same is for android cool bro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,really miss the multitusking function of android its great feature apple is unware of multitasking on screen are you joker common bro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,samsung ultra or iphone pro iphone pro for me no brainer imho and called this as incher phone on steriod perfect portable size phone on your skinny or slim jeans pocket if samsung put all the internal hardware including camera lens of ultra to inch besides the battery then obviously will choose definitely the
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,charging speed too low
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,is an external ssd like sandisk or crucial compatible with iphone pro think so transfer speeds will be slow asf tho due to the usb port
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone pro or xiaomi which one to choose these are so subjective it depends on preference and brand loyalty
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,one month use pro after huge jump from iphone feels satisfying just smooth best camera display compact design just easy to hold in single hand battery is enough for day use and worth of what pay for best phone so far in compact size instead larger max variant those dynamic island at first feel kinda weird after few interact seems fun work as shortcut too hope apple expand more apps use of those
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,from realme prothis phone is so fast
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,really good phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,great displaygood cameras and decent battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,massive upgradation from plus to pro

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,purchased iphone pro one month ago have been to apple store since to troubleshoot the ringer on my timer only responds at random times cannot depend on it also have not once received notification for reminder paid for this phone and those are apps depend on yet cannot they said it is bug in the software and there is basically nothing can do about it two of the employees had the same problem with the timer on their iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hello purchased iphone pro about day ago the camera is taking blurry and pixelized more go into settings select camera scroll down to the last option macro control put it on it will start focusing on macro objects objects very close to the camera lens
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ha ha ha see you need to do it every months apple devices just charge it and there you more you dont need to do anything of that nonsense software updates overtime improve the phone drastically especially for samsung the is obviously quite old now so naturally itll be slower than before as its using older hardware samsung has not had an issue with lag or stutters since the maybe even the so to claim otherwise is bs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,isnt time wasting only search how to enter recovery mode and do it before you turn on more ha ha ha see you need to do it every months apple devices just charge it and there you go no mess no stress just use itend of story
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,nah no need to do this timewasting thingsid just use my user friendly ios devicesend of more isnt time wasting only search how to enter recovery mode and do it before you turn on the device its simple and then after the wiped cache go to the option reboot and will power on normally wont take more than minute if you do it well and you only will do it every months or year samsung devices are friendly
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,well your samsung edge is very good because my brothers plus already lags and to more nah no need to do this timewasting thingsid just use my user friendly ios devicesend of story
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,im still using my iphone xs year old phone and untill now still run buttery smooth wi more well your samsung edge is very good because my brothers plus already lags and to me needs to be disposed and also can feel the lagging issue on my sammy tab which has qualcom chip also but never experience this issue on my sons ipad mini which is to my surprise still buttery smooth with the latest ipados which was recently updated because of the optimised apple ios
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,if youre aiming for short term use choose su but for long term use just get iphone pro more im still using my iphone xs year old phone and untill now still run buttery smooth with no hiccups what so ever and my brother is using plus snapdragon chip and for him it lags lot and makes him useless so he replaced it with xiaomi phone as he is an android fanboy galaxy phones are for long term still using the galaxy edge plus and the iphone both still performing great for the age except the support and battery for both the galaxy exynos is smooth and doesnt have hiccups the qualcomm shouldnt have it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,those who already bought iphone pro india suggest me from below iphone pro more if youre aiming for short term use choose su but for long term use just get iphone pro no doubt im still using my iphone xs year old phone and untill now still run buttery smooth with no hiccups what so ever and my brother is using plus snapdragon chip and for him it lags lot and makes him useless so he replaced it with xiaomi phone as he is an android fanboy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,for real the battery life on this phone is complete trash it couldnt even last me ho more my iphone pro lasts me almost days use it for everything apart from playing games destroyed my last phones battery by playing games
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,get only americans use iphones bro look around you you surely dont live in usa and most of the people in the country you live in would definitely have an iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hello all here we should talk abt pro and not about samsung and redmi bro you do realise that they are talking about comparison dont you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,if ever wanted to buy an iphone this would be it compact size amazing camera and battery performance kinda have to agree on the fact that iphones manage their batteries better than almost every android phone even as an android fan my only issue is that am damn well sure that if bought this phone apple would try every single card on the deck to get me into their ecosystem
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,is very good phone am happy with it hello all here we should talk abt pro and not about samsung and redmi
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,my wife uses galaxy ultra which catches terrible photos in comparison to my iphone pro more lies
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,friend of mine has the iphone pro the samsung squad destroyed it in night time photos more is very good phone am happy with it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,love its design specially the front camera design
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the iphone is much better quality phone samsung phones are not blind reason people hate iphone users you cant even give him good reason to back ur claim by the way what model of iphone are you using
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,will stop buying iphones the moment apple removes the alert switch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,is your battery life experience better than their tests yes my typical use from morning to evening only consumes around battery where better rated android phones consumed far more battery than this
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,mine lasts an entire day perhaps ur phone is having issues well said have no issues with this phone at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ive had iphones since the very first design always pricey but great quality with superb cam more must be missing something here have sim activated no problem at all with signal my friend lives in the area where your from he has no problem at all so do you have evidence of what your saying alot of misinformed people on here to be honest dont think you actually have one
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yeah it also made the phone topheavy and uncomfortable to hold in one hand get only americans use iphones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,thanks to the camera bump am unable to charge the iphone pro wirelessly in my car the more yeah it also made the phone topheavy and uncomfortable to hold in one hand
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,boringly good only downsides absence of universal back gesture and the lightning port
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,one gets used to with it good phone with esim option up to eight with two active esim at more can believe that its good phone though some report the camera is actually worse than on older models because of heavy processing but the ergonomicshandling is not so great
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yeah keep asking myself whos designed that horrible looking camera bump tim lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,what is happening in the market why are phones so expensive will only buy one when it cost more inflation or company greed pick
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,bad phone pro max better the pro max is just bigger
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,what hate about this phone is the rear camera bump yeah keep asking myself whos designed that horrible looking camera bump
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,best phone in the market great battery life smooth performance and camera is also good to use
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,thanx dude feel eye strain while using iphone pro in dim light area or less bri more yeah kind of any amoled problem not all but some amoled will get flicker at low brightness but you should return it for warranty meaning problem with display
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,prices went crazy who wants to spend his salary on phone if you paid with usd this wont be huge problem the problem is when convert to local currency this will be too expensive but yeah the same simple design and specs combine with high selling price make it feels luxury for high end person if you ask why they still buy iphone the same question why lei jun xiaomi ceo rather use an iphone than xiaomi flagship lol still iphone is apple made for flagship simplicity and lux class apple wont make device for low end class with low end chipset or make device with so many gimmick specs like colors or huge mp camera or huge size screen and battery bcoz mp with xiaomi tuning is still beaten by mp with apple tuning without leica or hasselblad or zeiss trademark
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,think hes finally distinct there product from android copycat what meant is apple more theres nothing special about that feature other than apple advertising that as something out of this world for buyers like you to think youre buying something special its just software integration with the front camera and sensors that any new upgrade of os can bring that to life you dont need special hardware to do that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ios was just crap too much sw bugs still some of theme exists camera dynamic range issue etc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,whats happening thanx dude feel eye strain while using iphone pro in dim light area or less brightness
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,great mistake indeed dislikings round display corner boxy design feel uncomfor more come to iphone se it has rectangular standard display comfortable rounded sides and light weight no dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,now pwm feeling headache wtf whats happening
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,was able to get in minutes on this iphone pro interesting findings
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,if you wanted better value for money the is literally the worst option basically the same more you for got to add has bigger antenna for better reception and newer modem for faster download speeds there are you tube videos showing how much faster it is almost double the speeds so yeah basically the same
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,amazing phone not only can flex it infront of people who still have iphone but it will save me from car crash so if get hit by train the phone will save me im waiting for shipping currently got in gold im excited to flex of my gold bar that could play roblox and amongus
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,purchased the pro and used it about month it was ok except for the severe overheating during conference video calls returned it for refund hopefully the next iphone will not burn up like the pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,still about weeks to ship jan jan seems like it was big success for apple the iphone and plus on the other hand are available the next day
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,that camera bump tho
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,base model is the best among the series because have iphone no pro no max only more iphone sucks only the camera has slight improvement better go for iphone instead and have you even had handson with the pro series irl if not dont complain that its heavy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,better wait to xiaomi better wait for ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,minimum focus distance for the main camera is awful some rd party apps cannot use the uw cam scanning small qr codes or other things isnt seamless the ai exerts lil bit too much on photos especially for selfies which become different from what we see in camera app preview preshots
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hi guys im using samsung wanna change my phone but im considering iphone more go for iphone pro have it and its awesome
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,feel great about this phone highly recommended friends also said it good purchase the more like winner lol iphones are quite expensive for what you get when comparing specs to android phones was loyal iphone user since they initially released it and switched to android in will never go back iphones bore me now same thing every year simple and seamless yet restrictive ui have an rog and it trumps the pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its too heavy youre literally judging book by its cover have handson with the phone before spouting nonsense its too heavy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,since iphone inches onwards iphone lost the one hand usage learn the reachability ac more rarely have to do that on inch iphones on the new ones it would probably have to be done more often and thats unnecessary
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yesterday was in the store to try out the new iphone pro what was wondering is if it more since iphone inches onwards iphone lost the one hand usage learn the reachability action long ago is double tap the home button now it is swipe down on the home line to bring the ui down do not tell me you forgot about that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,just bought two gb variant of these for me and my wife no regret and its better than my more yeah with apple you know you are getting the full package the software is fully optimised and integrated for the hardware there are too many android oems which are either barebones softwarewise or bloated with mishmash of different apps as someone who values smooth seamless experience there is no choice but apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,came across the phone as sample unit on the mall days ago and since gsma thinks that the more they confused ois with autofocus
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone mini doesnt exist yet the mini iphones are short lived only the and have mini variants
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,how does the batter compare to the pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,automatic auto call recoding this phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,better camera and longer battery life every year are all fine but feel apple needs year to take break and bring the pro phones down in weight like they should use the yearly efficiency gains to make the iphone pro lighter and if its selling point thinner while keeping similar feature set less than for the smaller but still big pro guess im weird but thats the reaction get from where they are currently going it just feels like they are compromising ergonomics for features they could upgrade the storage to gb base at the same to justify bringing less new features but maybe im overthinking and the notpro already serves that purpose
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,better wait for iphone pro instead better wait for iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,now using pro gb isnt worth upgrade to pro gb better wait for iphone pro instead
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,you couldve reviewed it first theres an iphone mini thats lighter than the base and pro more iphone mini doesnt exist
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,waaaay too heavy way too heavy this remark clearly shows you didnt even have proper handson with the phone yet may sound heavy but its not
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hi am looking at upgrading my xr iphone am presently looking at iphone pro iphone more being long time android user myself it was learning curve to switch to iphone but not difficult at all samsung freezes up too much for me and was totally unreliable half the stuff do on my iphone is already standard without me having to install all the apps like did on android recommend sticking with iphone way smoother and so much more reliable os now that was just my experience with samsung still love android but iphone is not as locked in like it used to be much more stable and reliable
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apple is good at making phones because its apples main source of revenue competit more but ios is optimised for iphone hardware and its big part of what makes them so fast if you somehow put ios onto android hardware the result may not be as great as you think
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,my problem with the xperia iv is the damn processor dont want phone thats more thats why iphone is better in taking videos photos camera quality and supporting feature like lidar for night mode aside iphone storage have nvme ssd compared to xperias normally should be ufs on top of that have option up to tb blazing fast ssd plus good image video compression methods make iphone take photo video fast and efficient sony you may have to opt for sd card which is slow and may not have the read and write for high quality videos and photos however sony would excel in option in sharing photo utility apps because photo and video format taken by android os normally can open on any pc bt nfc sharing and so on while iphone normally send thru messages whatsapp and airdrop between idevices only
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,no favours no bias just pointing out eachs strength if money is no issue you may more my problem with the xperia iv is the damn processor dont want phone thats going to overheat and close on me after taking secs of video
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,thank you looks like you favour the iphone no favours no bias just pointing out eachs strength if money is no issue you may think lesser amount of strength less favours but no some people really value those niche features like jack sd slot bt transfer utility apps
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone takes better photo videos and takes up less storage iphone have better mobile game more thank you looks like you favour the iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,weight of brick
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hr standby doesnt sound like it beats them btw am not samsung boy its not always about the endurance rating in battery life test can trust it shows that even iphone pro outlasted samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,although this like every other iphone is overpriced this is the first time ive been impressed by apple would kill to buy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,with this price you can buy up to midrange phones with great battery life what are you still waiting for go get it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone is good for people who want to keep their phone for yrs its performance is best in the business this time the cameras are also up there with the best battery life is also great thanks to software optimization iphone is essentially for basic day to day users android is for advanced users who want as much tech as possible they have surpassed apple many years back pushing the innovation beyond
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,and yet itll still beat samsungs in both battery life and camera hr standby doesnt sound like it beats them btw am not samsung boy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,poor camera and mah battery for eur in only phone these guys are real come more and yet itll still beat samsungs in both battery life and camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,global versions have physical sim if you dont live in usa you wont have to worry more hi my question please if the both physical sim china version and both sim and physical sim international version both are same features and specifications except sim slot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,than go and buy thats just an illustration lol could use anything maybe highquality powerbanks no or charging cables and power bricks all in all as per gsmarenas review that wont change the fact that this flagship phones battery is simply terrible
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,wow im true apple hater just hate this company for its extreme greed but have to confess this is first time the new iphone camera is truly the king the previous generations were good but never the best this time is different the photos from all cameras are outstanding detailed and sharp but not oversharpened with accurate colors great white balance first time ever for new iphone launch im impressed hope samsung will not fail with
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,worried about battery as heavy user is really frustatingi rather buy midrange phone with more with this price you can buy up to midrange phones with great battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,great phone no doubt but the battery is just terrible for this day and age when there more worried about battery as heavy user is really frustatingi rather buy midrange phone with great battrey life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,best ultrawide lens and sensor ive seen on phone so far better than that of my digital cameras the static dynamic island is just too discouraging and annoying to look at though
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the photo mp raw and video quality of the pro models this year is absolutely stunning gr more mi ultra with leica authentic looks clearly better these mp or ones downscaled to mp look good but its sunny day so most phones would do well some with larger sensor even better if their raw output is taken and downscaled and theres hassle to achieve that downscaling in iphone vs simple mode in ultra sadly gsmarena doesnt do high resolution and downscaling for low light where su would clearly have advantage with larger sensor oh and this overly repeated myth of apple being the choice for content creators without hp jack and microsd slot none would be good for this purpose but at least su seems to have best camera so far sony is better on other things but falls short on camera ironically lets see what their pro model does this time
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ultra is virtually identical to ultra what
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,at first glance you can already see the differences between them ultra ultra httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone something that in the iphone has changed since the details only the line when changed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,things that makes iphone pro stressful the dynamic island to me the dynamic more global versions have physical sim if you dont live in usa you wont have to worry about that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ive used both android and ios and always returned to android iphones are really more perfectly agree with you here not having location toggle to turn off in the control centre cant adjust the keyboard height no back swipe option in the keyboard app to delete text dreadful procedure to set ringtone no app lock no parallel storage options can keep adding on that said the camera algorithm is really good on the iphones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,different in cam and cpu from but its many different to switch apple become more poor in new technology
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,never really understood the fight between android and ios fanboys and girls if you hate one more nicely put thank you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,android bois are always obsessed with apple and what they do not half as many people with iph more its good thing they dominate in continents then not gonna count antarctica
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hello buy this phone as gift and is unoppende buy it form usa and neet to travet to ge more esim only are ok
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,samsung has already implemented esim wow have never seen dumb comment samsung had esim
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,question to indian users looking to buy pro model which is priced at lac inr at the mo more wait till amazon prime sake it will come down to less than lakh iphone pro price was below lakh during the prime sale else try to get it from abroad there will be some price reduction at stores like reliance months down the line if price is not an issue buy it it will easily last for years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apple is the world leader in cpu technology
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,checked in store the iphone pro it is hideous huge humps on the back for those cheap and ugly looking cameras very unbalanced in hand heavy and hard to get grip due to its sharp edges it is useless that it has round corners better would have been round margins etched screen margins to round it little bit whoever will see you with such phone in hand will think you got cheap chinese brick no way it is worth dollars
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,mkbhd the iphone famboy praised this new iphone so much he recommend new iphone for the best more no said lg did it first
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,now understand why android boys are so obsessed with the ram httpsyoutubeccxevtuu more android bois are always obsessed with apple and what they do not half as many people with iphone care about what android does to bother trolling them that says it all toxic android lovers that are unable to praise their own devices and enjoy them instead they live to hate on apple and iphone if their devices are so superior they would sell more and dominate the market they arent
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,going over to iphone for the first time welcome you are going to wonder why more sorry this is ridiculous apple have just released the iphone which is virtually identical to the just so peeps will be more inclined to pay the extra cash for the pro because of the new dynamic island which is glorified version of notification bar which android has had for years brainwashed android users be sensible
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,dont get an iphone if you feel you dont need it or want it simple dont advertise pro videography without an actual pro connectivity of fast data transfer as simple as it is
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,go for pixel then pixel phones is even worse than samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,perfect size for most people who struggles with to inch android phones added to my phone fan list
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,xiaomi is nothing without lei jun say xiaomi is the future wait and see xiaomis budget phones were almost perfect before miui they started messing things up after that but above iphone was is and will be the obvious king
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,lol yes buggy ad filled chinese garbage is the future maybe miui is no bugs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,bought samsung ultra but now regreit it always been on android but been disappointed more going over to iphone for the first time welcome you are going to wonder why you didnt do this years ago already but hey good later than never its always nice to see android users waking up from the brainwashing android companies do
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,xiaomi is the future lol yes buggy ad filled chinese garbage is the future
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,hope not all the xiaomi have seen all bad the soft is mess cheap but we get what more xiaomi is nothing without lei jun say xiaomi is the future wait and see
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,no physical sim in the usa can no longer pull out my sim and just use an old phone total more finally someone who didnt sick apple fanboy thanks bruh just gonna get pixel
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yes indeed im buying iphone pro max now and im upgrading from iphone got year cy more good for you but should get the pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the hell chip ghz clockspeed good job apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,can use dynamic island on landscape mode
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,im glad for having you here as my brother and biggest supporters
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its as if they decided mm is the perfect width and they adjust the other front dimensions screen size height around that cant tell how good it is because havent used it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yeah apple fanboy no thank you few features tweak sell new model again why change strategy more but the thing is not everyone has the or even the
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,best phone of with incredible processing power and picture quality apple is mast more but to complement all these and operate best the battery is shockingly of underwhelming capacity on pro models so much pay for pro only to get third grade battery capacity around mah which is unable to even have fast charging its just apples idea of getting you upgrade every year and not hold on to the same model one vicious loop am impressed with most other features but not the battery its like deliberate kill
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,absolutely hilarious and theyre still on usb
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,after years of using nokia will buy this phone hope not to be dissapointed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,does everyone realize apple isnt updating the iphones for people to get every year its for more yes indeed im buying iphone pro max now and im upgrading from iphone got year cycle and im only upgrading when they stop releasing new ios version for the model im using
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,no fingerprint scanner no back button no secure folder but it is an apple you have to bu more fingerprint scanner its good to include one but not necessary when theres face id back button just swipe from the edge of the screen secure folder the entire iphone is encrypted by default if you want true data security you shouldnt have it on your phone anyway
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,can confirm that iphone pro have sim tray and esim united kingdom edition hope more not all uk networks have esim support there is still sim card slot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,im confused about the sim card part for international users becuz dont see sim tray only usa has no sim tray
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,nope no physical sim on apple site they say dual esim support not compatible with more dual esim support means two esims can be used at the same time like since iphone series its either two esims or esim physical sim making it dual sim only the us has no sim card slot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apple is actually trying to make life better with their smartphones while every other manufacturer is still trying to catch up on processing power benchmarks lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apple has esim feature since the iphone no does not have esim it has from xs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,well after five years with that notch apple nailed it now hes on par with with the whole android industry trends hz nits displaythe best one yet mp camera punchhole like front camera im an android user but after launching this phone ill consider to switch to an iphone yes its expensive but its worth it think
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,under display front camera and popup camera has some serious drawbacks so guess apple is just being really patient to actually trying to perfect no drawbacks solution to allscreen display at their rd all the while giving android phone manufacturers something to that they can copy and later apple themselves could learn their copies to find the best solution
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,if we cant get the round edges back please at least go back to inch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,spec does not mention whether apple iphone supports or not if yes which bands
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,whatever they said apple is king of the king king of the gods
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,for this price better take last xperia best smart for good luck on number of updates its sure to be the worst of the whole flagship series
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone must use two hands android can use with one hand for me big difference actually not true the other way around buddy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,sure because apple makes lighter right uh not cuz of that if you hold it in your hand it isnt as heavy as what you think will feel
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the dynamic island looks interesting although lame name but man apple are making their fan more totally agree dont really like the pill or dynamic island look at all so glad went with the pro first time splurging huge money on phone got my old after year for very good price but that display got annoying and super old quick
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,but first theyll mock apple for removing physical sim slot samsung has already implemented esim
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,watch samsung copy esim only in few years but first theyll mock apple for removing physical sim slot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,and how do you know that they dont need if you dont need doesnt mean more looks like someones defending the opinion which the user whom replied to made
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,it comes in with esim and physical sim options nope no physical sim on apple site they say dual esim support not compatible with physical sim cards
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,actually no its not as useful as ultrawide actually telephoto camera is way more useful with mm wide cam is already really wide and any lower than mm is already considered uw territory by any camera standard on the other hand with mm you get perfect camera for portrait shots and far away objects
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,guess better start lifting weights again if want to buy pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone and pro for the size cameras and price guess for the time ill stick with my xperia iii and wait for the next year
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,my point is that it is but it wont feel as heavy as you might think in real life sure because apple makes lighter right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its literally listed on the apple website httpswwwapplecomiphoneprospecs my point is that it is but it wont feel as heavy as you might think in real life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,think its apple version of that sensor since imx have mp mp in iphone pro but more sorry who said they used the imx
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,never thought theyd make such hideous abomination aka notch into something so cute and functional ill probably move to ios next year as use lot of third party apps ios is probably the best option for me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the main camera sensor might be sony imx think its apple version of that sensor since imx have mp mp in iphone pro but have similar sensor and pixel size maybe sony tweak that sensor design as per apple requirements
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,have you even had handson with the phones to check their weight if not dont anyhow more its literally listed on the apple website httpswwwapplecomiphoneprospecs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,agreed waiting for the usbc to be implemented in iphone most of the ipadmini are already more next year apple will remove lightning port to save the environment and will promote to use wireless charger
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,nothing new only might buy it to keep the life battery ok with new ios since always apple is playing with that technology
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,slightly upgrade with wide punch hole screen not worth to upgrade
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,weight lolz and pro max lolz next please mini is still king how about other rugged phone which weighs more than iphone pro models
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,where is iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,and youd lose that bet love using periscope zoom its definitely more useful th more yeah you love spying on random people just because of periscope
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,impressed that they still need pill
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,okay so this phone doesnt get wifi it says only what is the power of the speakers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,one word disappointing if would get an iphone ill wait for what the has to offer more agreed waiting for the usbc to be implemented in iphone most of the ipadmini are already using them anyway
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,same as before
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the size is very pocket friendly and new price range is also budget friendly love you aiph pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,seems like copy of the galaxy to the ultra modelscamera bumpsmp cameralow light more do you even know what prores video cenimatic video and dolby vision hdr are hope one day you will learn by how much samsung is after apple btw prores takes up to gb of space in minute prores takes gb in minute whereas fps takes mb and around mb
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,except for the new hole punch and lots of stuff lot of same stuffs which was removed from the old model and and add now as new feature
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,apple is very stubborn ugly display same design for the past years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ummm hz display always on display newer chip mp camera better camera lens better more all of these features you just named already existed while ago
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,pro india price is usd which looks very high was hoping even if more honestly the non pro is quite literally an iphone pro but renamed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,why would you even need highly bet you dont even have an device to utilise the more and how do you know that they dont need if you dont need doesnt mean you can just assume that no one needs it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its ugly very good comment my friend
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,worst than notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its lightning usb lmao
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,iphone has no change it only upgrade the memory not change the shape
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,yet again same phone for higher price
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,best smartphone ever than others
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its ugly
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,simply they added new few words in the specs lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,idk about yall but in my country the price starts at dollars and for the pro model more lol is gonna be like pro is gonna be like ttd you could buy used car with
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,lol that thing is ugly even for an iphone not one but notches impressive at least is not as ugly as the iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,it doesnt have periscope camera and fingerprint on this age of covid its sickening and dis more first why would you even need periscope camera bet you dont even use it and secondly even with no fingerprint sensor apples face id is already very secure compared to lots of face scanning out there
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,same designe as iphone nothing huge to upgrade from pro to pro except for the new hole punch and lots of stuff
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,no need mpx camera no mpx apple downgrade ultra wide camera pro max and more not true samsungs mp camera also supports
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,still dont know why people buy theese productsthey literally improve one item per yea more why would you even need highly bet you dont even have an device to utilise the videos you record
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,this one looks atleast better on the other hand they just slapped the name on iphone and called it day
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,how much battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,people out there be saying why you complaining just dont buy it people have the more am seeing apple walking on nokias walk
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,the actual mp pixel size is apple use pixel binning so called quad pixel design resu more think its sony imx derivatives almost same specs but it confusing since apple claimed quad pixel design resulting in final pixel size if the natives pixel size is it should make it not with quad bayer design
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,alongside the pixel xl this looks better httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,lol this ppl complaining dont buy if you dont want thats it people out there be saying why you complaining just dont buy it people have the right to criticise thats how improvements are made if you dont have anyone criticising you wont get any of those new features think before you type dumb shxt
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ios with home screen fontsicon packs and themes support
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,its completely hustle they didnt even made the models with same screen improvementjust for people to buy the other one thats why ill never ever ever be apple customer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,very cool photography and videography capabilities by looking at the launch event but pretty more dont get an iphone if you feel you dont need it or want it simple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,rip notch also wheres fortnite
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,nobody cares bro apple fanboi detected
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,ah so it arrives phone with no sim card personally look forward to seeing more manufactures adopt this so carriers are forced to provide esims enmasse
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,their are very lazy same design for the past years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,any news on bluetooth codecs supporting aptx or ldac im guessing nah
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,no video this is apple were talkin go about here theyll leave that for future model
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,think the camera is about to take the throne
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,wait why are the dimensions different than the previous gen its even different from basic iphone model itself
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,still no periscope no buy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,how about take picture at full moon
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,where is typec what disappointment so true
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro,gb ram in is joke
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this no longer holds in my face unlock in samsung low end device works so well even in th more it is still not as secure as face id
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,but is the pro max any good in yes it is still very fast phone with good display and camera and plenty of updates to come to the software
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone pro max or iphone which one the best promaxi had it after that bought andnow im going to buy pro max again iphone hangs alot and get hot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,always go with the pro max variant than the base models but its base model is not available in gb storage
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its difficult after unlocking to use other networks esim
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,he is fan of apple products but hes not wrong with this one faceid is superior to al more this no longer holds in my face unlock in samsung low end device works so well even in the dark because the screen brightens up to capture the face
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,none of them are useless buy samsung tap on clip to paste it in the text box
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,raw photo quality is not up to acceptable level regret for my spent amount on this handset overall performance is slow comparing with android tecno camon premier
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thank you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nvr owned ios device before soquestions can download and install modded apps outsid more not out of the box you have to jailbreak it and void the warranty
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes you can sideload apps on ios there are also ways to jailbreak and use developer modes iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,read somewhere the iphone can do sweep panoramas with its ultrawide lens but fail to see any results here not even sweeps with the standard lens as used to always be published on gsm arena these are dealbreaker features as having the possibility of getting really good large detailed panoramas is hugely important for many people so why has gsm arena stopped doing them at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,based on the specifications and benchmarks provided would rate the apple iphone pro max as follows performance the powerful apple bionic chipset hexacore processor and high benchmark scores indicate exceptional performance for demanding tasks and smooth multitasking camera with triplecamera setup including highresolution main camera telephoto lens with optical zoom and an ultrawide lens the iphone pro max should offer versatile photography capabilities however without specific assessments its challenging to provide definitive rating display the inch ltpo super retina xdr oled display with hz refresh rate hdr and dolby vision support ensures vibrant and immersive visual experience with excellent brightness levels and sharpness software ios apples latest operating system provides userfriendly interface regular updates and vast selection of applications offering smooth and reliable software experience design the combination of glass front and back stainless steel frame and ip water and dust resistance showcases premium and durable design while the slim dimensions contribute to its overall appeal please note that these ratings are subjective and based solely on the information provided actual user experiences and professional reviews should be considered for comprehensive and accurate assessment of the device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,in this day and age theres just no excuse to wait an hour for your phone to charge to when some manufacturers make it charge for half the price samebetter performance samebetteralternative at same class hardware and you get free charger it depends not on apple or samsung or xiaomi it depends on me and you the customers as long as you happy with what youve got for what you pay they will deliver minimum possible so that youll buy the next one remember its up to us not them dont have it with apple im flabbergasted with their clients but if theyre happy and not bother me or others with different taste can live with that and ignore them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,sounds like how to destroy your battery to me im not that obsessed about my more instead of using one battery and charge it slowly you put two in parallel sacrificing capacity and charge them both at the same time my poco fgt is an excellent example two batteries charging at watts max if you want turbo mode if not instead of less than youll wait like to and save your batteries thats smart solution if ever saw one
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,they should apple and samsung learn from china how to make turbo charging sounds like how to destroy your battery to me im not that obsessed about my phone to not be able to stand an hour or so for my phone to fully charge but guess if scrolling tiktok is all you do then yeah would be nice lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,maybe they actually dont know how to fit that fastcharging tech into phone they should apple and samsung learn from china how to make turbo charging
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,samsung galaxy ultra is much higher in benchmark than iphone pro max iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,really love my apple iphone pro max deep purple its very expensive but its absolutely worth it appleiphone iphoneislife
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apart from samsung iphone and pixel which other brand that take good non natural shot at defau more if ur budget is high gen xiaomi ultra its currently the best camera phone for photography out right now and can tell the colours pop
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,as in the past the pro max is once again apples flagship iphone variant one step above more samsung galaxy ultra is much higher in benchmark than iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,work in uaebut this time im vacation rentals for pakistan went to this item deliver more yes wwwamazoncom
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no it is not my point you just cant read properly looks like say that apple does more maybe they actually dont know how to fit that fastcharging tech into phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,tried this out from my moms friend who is invited to my little bros birthday days ago and man this phone is an absolute powerhouse
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,request you to give the number instead of the star rating you give to the reivew of the phone so that it would be easier to take the phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im happy with this phone if you hate iphone go buy samsung or other brands simple as that lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,after years your phone will be old as hell probably lost or broken by then and the batt more still use my huawei plus only had to replace the batery after yearsm and never broke anything and use it every single day for work so anything last what you want it to last
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,been user of galaxy phones for decade just got gifted with an iphone pro max well cannot understand what the hoopla is all about the new features in iphone has been there with galaxy phones for years photo quality is user dependent actually find the photos took with galaxy sharper and better defined than the pro max not sure buy all the hype into iphonestexting calls and messenger functions are identical speed test did not show any difference the screens are brighter and crisper in galaxy phones iphones are way too expensive but hold good resale value one area where iphones are better is battery life and itunes finally can ditch my old ipod and carry one device when am travelling
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apples iphone pro max is the undisputed champion of smartphones and puts the google more after years your phone will be old as hell probably lost or broken by then and the battery will have to be replaced at least once which can only be done in expensive official apple center because apple does not sell repair parts to third party suppliers ios is mobile os made to be easy to work with but as consequence it lacks in features and is annoying for people who want phone to do more than just take picture or scroll instagram conclusion one is better of with higher end android phone that cost half the price of iphone hardware quality will be same or better software experience much more satisfying
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thx bro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cant wait to have one upgrade from iphone pro max ecosystem is powerful dont care about more suggest you wait for iphone pro max it will be true upgrade with usbc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,zte did good hiding it but also getting good selfie quality is another thing frankly more am not shock because my good always with me inshallah
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yah its okayvery close that buy itbut still hold my horse and wait pro max even really dont like that esimits just only spying and control usejust think also googles new passwork ideamore control well hope its not must force here
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,performance is killerbeyond expectationsa true flagshipapple has finally nailed it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the ultimate phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is iphone pro max good to buy hong kong version having dual sim in uae and which can travel more trying to say indian made not good
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,samsung has won this match because the note ultra has more better features then the ipho more your id tells it all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ok new iphone user and have to say love this phone have had all the other flagship nothing close this snatch one up you wont be disappointed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you might want to tell the whole story re battery life its fine on standby and indoors when connected to wifi only but outdoors on mobile data the battery drains rapidly more than pro or pro max point other reviewers have noted
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple need to erase punch holes and islands in frontput or more watts in the charging more iphone pro max endurance rate while all other phone endurance rate max rate good luck
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,holding both the pro max and this new beast the pro max should say im not disappointed but its expected from to to and now feel like theres nothing new aesthetically however its the first time felt tired of the same cycle if this will continue think am going to say hello to another smartphone brand just wish huawei still has google services sad
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,your opinion will be true when everyones got underdisplayfrontcamera but till now more have it its very good
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,happy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,think theyre doing stand up jokes about simplicity
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,whatever apple may call it dynamic island etc it is simply patch or trick to hi more your opinion will be true when everyones got underdisplayfrontcamera but till now what apple done is so creative am pretty sure that you never think of that idea
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post he is fan of apple products but hes not wrong with this one faceid is superior to all other face detection solutions you cant compare faceid which also detects actual contour of the face and also works in dark where android phones all use face unlocking which uses just selfie camera it has zero depth information and they are all absolutely useless in dark only exception is huawei but im not sure if they still use their dot projection face unlocking also they arent very relevant anymore on global market
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post maybe you are right this phone is for people who are crazy in their productivities not only using phone for chatting taking photos doing social medias
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the optics and sensor used in the main camera module are outstanding hands down the best image quality ive seen on an iphone the ultrawide is also very good but the mp is just limitation you can see muddled details at zoom so dont zoom it pro maxs battery is also excellent the pro version is also promising in compact body but its battery is just handicapped with endurance rating adding this to my faved devices little bit of context hate apple as company but do acknowledge great tech when see one
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,most android phones have both fingerprint scanners and face unlock dont get why apple more face unlocking in all androids except huawei are unreliable so it can be excluded
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post lol overpriced android junk better options exist other than the reno especially from its sister brand realme
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,good selfie cameras have not been beneficial for society
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yup ud camera is trash rn companies are struggling for its improvement good selfie cameras have not been beneficial for society
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,sure it is if someone can do faceid entirely through display im all for it until then more yup ud camera is trash rn companies are struggling for its improvement
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,full screen display is the future and you know that iphone will be left behind as always sure it is if someone can do faceid entirely through display im all for it until then dont mind the new pill design or even the old notch design also most people not me care about selfie cams and underdisplay ones are all absolutely terrible
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,could you please provide some proofs of that well im using both daily more full screen display is the future and you know that iphone will be left behind as always
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,likely due to the fact they said when face id was announced how much more secure it was and adding fingerprint sensor now would just look bad also face unlock is often more convenient and works in more conditions especially now you can use it with mask on
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wish they just put punch hole camera and ultrasonic fps why would apple use fp more face id is superior to any underscreen fps which are mediocre at best currently mediocre you trying to be funny lets just say both face id and ultrasonic fps are fast and secure but having punch hole camera for now is way better than pill shape cut out
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well he said nothing new here so which android has the dynamic island dont care about dynamic island thingy prefer having full screen display but the ud camera tech for now is still crap
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the under display fingerprint reader really struggles and near useless on my ultra as my more that never happened on sfe but iphone touchid is useless with wet fingers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple copied dynamic elaund animations from samsung bubble notifications lmao no its definitely not from that totally not the same at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,face id is superior to any underscreen fps could you please provide some more could you please provide some proofs of that well im using both daily with face id you dont need to press the scanner all the time face id works in background when im just regularly use my phone dont need to think it much touchless biometric is future not something which need your attention every time you use it android oems will get there too eventually its just matter of time when it happens
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ultrawide and telephoto are worse than in huawei pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,woooooooow really android has been doing crazy sht to achieve uninterupted full screen smart more wish they just put punch hole camera and ultrasonic fps why would apple use fps when they are already so much ahead with face id it now even works with face masks and also in landscape face id is superior to any underscreen fps which are mediocre at best currently
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,doubt they will go back to qualcomm because tensor gives google the advantage of having the more tensor uses exynos as samsung and google working together and the current exynos is to inefficientunoptimised and slowin benchmark exynos peaks at with half perfomance while at with much higher performance
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,another great device from apple and good review thanks and then there is the predictable wailing from those who come out from the woodwork to snap and spit nonsense in order to justify their own often inferior and uglier choices it will be the same next year and the year after and the year after that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,one more con is that it is still not using usbc port many will wait for iphone which sho more with the use of usbc only well hope more additional features comes all previous iphone would look old
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,which android has dynamic island woooooooow really android has been doing crazy sht to achieve uninterupted full screen smartphone popup camera nd display on the back under display camera apples solution the infamous notch now evolved to pill shape cut out wish they just put punch hole camera and ultrasonic fps
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still dont understand why so many androids think the iphoneios is inferior have tried several androids phones none was better than the iphone suspect most people here who speak against iphone have never had one
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post which android has dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hi about endurance battery test lets compare pm vs pm they both hit but more they weigh the scores towards idle time and call thats why some androids had been scoring way higher scores even when iphones have had comparable or better web browsing and movie watching having an integrated modem makes call time longer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hope this proves one and for all that antutu is trash benchmark higher gpu scores that mean sht on anything else
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,agree android has better ux and ui compared to ios ios is complex agree when it comes to processors but ios has way better ui for me android is little backward when it comes to this its easier to use iphone than galaxy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,collect smartphones ive got all iphones ever made think that the iphone pro max is definately worth it if your deciding between pro and pro max but if you just want new iphone think that the iphone or the rd model se are better desicion
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dx omark scored points and ranked nd in the global rankings dxomark is garbage they never rate the appearance of the image just some visual data such as noise or noise distribution take one look at the photos and you immediatelly see that all photo processing algorithms are poor downsampled mpix photo looks better than outofcamera mpix way more better the original mpix have fuzzy edges ugly moir terrible rendition of leaves or grass it reminds me of times when dxo rated some huawei as the best and more than half of its photos were totally out of focus but yes they were smoothed denoised and looked so clear so they gained excellent rating
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow iphone pro ranks second in the global rankings with its powerful camera performance
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,reallly you familiar with phonebuff on youtube youll see there who beats who spoi more dont know what that guy was talking about mean aud for galaxy in czech republic you can find one with as low as eur aud to keep the same currency at this price is very nice phone also there are better phones than the for just little more something like eur and this ones you can get with sd sd or some good dimensity chipsets certainly not times worse than an iphone pro max as for the cameras this is very subjective territory and anyway after you pass certain price point something like eur all phones have very good cameras no need to spent eur for this but apple users will be apple users and they will always find excuses for the overpriced iphones thats why apple can do whatever they want each year
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone pro is worth all the money it is the first apple phone in the last years that is not utterly ugly people claimed the notch did not bother them much but the truth is it was hideous
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it is new to the pros but these are the first iphones with dualfrequency gnss navigation and the nonpro models dont have it it is another first for apple but more common elsewhere
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,aside from apples great processor really dont understand why people think apple phones are more agree android has better ux and ui compared to ios ios is complex
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,precisely tensor is explicitely midrange chip theres no way around that samsung more couldnt have summed it up better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it certainly beats all phones most games also render at higher default resolution with bett more it is always fascinating to see that people would spend on phone with inch screen for gaming
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,throttling test proves how superior apple chips are it certainly beats all phones most games also render at higher default resolution with better graphics at the same exact settings for iphone pro max but can be higher here
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,my phone cost but iphone isnt faster get what pay for and then some more dont know what phone youre comparing honestly costs aud here for gb version samsung wouldve costed around think with the same storage and the iphone is faster than the samsung build quality is better cameras are also better overall
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,now with from any other phone in the market lol theres no near perfect phon more iqoo far from it rubbish front camera limited software support poor aftersales and service networks ui seems to imitate other brands maybe not ios but other chinese phones only the primary camera works well think no current phones are close to perfection
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,closest to perfection from any other phone in the market now with from any other phone in the market lol theres no near perfect phone yet or maybe there is vivo iqoo pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,whats the difference between near perfect and closest to perfectionqu more closest to perfection from any other phone in the market
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you said its near perfect disagree mentioned few things as to why it more didnt say its near perfect
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,what part of my comment you didnt understood maybe read it again you said its near perfect disagree mentioned few things as to why its far from perfect confused between near and far
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so practically they are going back to qualcomm then why do they even tried this tensor thing more doubt they will go back to qualcomm because tensor gives google the advantage of having the freedom to adapt the soc to their needs the artificial intelligence capabilities of its camera are impressive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its far from perfect its heavy still has notch even thou ultrasonic scanner is more what part of my comment you didnt understood maybe read it again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,barely beats precisely tensor is explicitely midrange chip theres no way around that samsung manufacturing process understand exynosbased architecture takes toll on battery life as well however the custom isp along with google algorithm decimate every phone camera in the market this includes including apple and their fancy bionic new mp module tensor in pixel despite using same cpu will have new isp so it will only improve over that of course performance in games will still be vastly inferior to gen upcoming gen and the bionic but dont forget that of mobile games are greedy trash so it doesnt matter if you want the very best bleeding edge mobile photography thatll blow you mind everytime pixel remains the only way to go dont take me wrong apple iphone pro max takes great pictures most of them are technically comparable to pixel they just dont have the appeal theyre flat dull chaotic neutral pixel shots are wallpaperready
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,tensor is the product of collaboration between samsung and google but the tensor chip is pa more so practically they are going back to qualcomm then why do they even tried this tensor thing is like they are saying we know that tensor chip is not as good as qualcomms but we wanted to try something anyway typical google style starting something just because they have the money and they can but not having the guts or ambition to finish it or at least make it better or more competitive is the same case scenario with samsung and exynos after years of just releasing inferior chipsets in europe at least now they admit they were wrong and they want to implement only sd chipsets starting with series as samsung customer can only ask what was the point of all this inferior exynos chipsets for all this years they werent more efficient they werent more powerful they werent cheaper they werent competitive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dont know what to think about this review everything is classleading but when look into your photo compare tool dont see nothing classleading on iphone im actually disappointed that ugly over sharpening etc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,google pixel is not weak the tensor chip is comparable to the snapdragon it is not weak it is poor heats but still beast the from mtk was also good competitor tensor is basically exynos xd
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lol dont trust that silly website speed tests like theirs are irrelevant still very more irrelevant yes cause thats not how we use our phone its just fun to watch these phones push to their limit in fair test without human error
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is your phone faster than the iphone or has brighter screen my phone cost but iphone isnt faster get what pay for and then some if you live in house without roof then you need really bright screen
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just satisfied by my phone that literally can do anything that apple do except the cam more is your phone faster than the iphone or has brighter screen
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,people in czechia will be paying near more for same device compared to americans it more taxes is one of the factors but the other reasons for price hikes are the current state of world economy and apple itself that want to keep healthy profit margin the latter can be avoid as trillion dollars company they obviously can absorb the cost without affecting the consumer they still can make profit albeit it lower than year before
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,phonebuffs speedtest is out iphone is dethroned is faster ehh gen is coming think thats more of headache for scamsung this further demonstrates their inferiority to tsmc if in past two years tsmc made android phones chips instead of samsung then such results would be more common as for apple their inferiority to android is as evident as daylight already what can they say except muh geekbench and in future they wont even be able to utter that phrase their downfall would be even earlier had it not been for past years of scamsung chip
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nice better than any android out there wish said the ultra but battery life is terrible and it heats up quickly not to mention the battery expanding issue xiaomi ultra ui is poor
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so your point is if company wants to do something itll do it you should be silent ne more no it is not my point you just cant read properly looks like say that apple does not have interest to give iphoneipad the same high charging speeds of macbooks and also say many xiaomioneplus users here somehow think apple does not know how to have for iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,every country has taxes also devices cme from indiachina there is at least import taxes us prices though do not include the consumer sales tax in the quoted price different us states have different sales tax this is tax that consumers must pay therefore the price in the us is the price before sales tax and the real price consumers have to pay will be higher than the launch price as sales tax must be added the price will vary from state to state due to each sate setting its own rate of sales tax for europe the vat sales tax in europe which needs to be paid by the consumer is already included in the launch price so the listed price is the price consumers actually pay after tax in europe
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hmm it barely throttles performance with impressive sustained performance the needs some big improvements
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,from onwards ever phone camera even crappy chines ones are decent if you dont pixel peep and just watch them on phone screen or share them on socials where they get compressed to oblivion except for videos where iphone excels picture are just that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,us prices probably dont include local taxes or do they every country has taxes also devices cme from indiachina there is at least import taxes
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the pp camera is competitive but definitely not destroying the su or iphone more google pixel is not weak the tensor chip is comparable to the snapdragon
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,did the buggy pixel pro destroy any flagship phone it tails behind iphone galaxy the pp camera is competitive but definitely not destroying the su or iphone each camera is better in certain circumstances and worse in others besides that the pixel is weakling
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,in czech republic this starts at eur phone prices have become too high yes its more youre having it for cheap if its there its here
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not fan of the company but have to admit their top of the line devices perform like top of the line should kudos to engineers shame they couldnt figure out the udc face idcameras would be pretty much perfect phone minus slow charging maybe next year
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,pro version is same as pro max can save some bucks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ok so whats your point apple does not want to but ppl here that use xiaomi and oneplus think apple lacks tech to do it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphones loosing their charm sales are dropping all over world
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lack of typec port esim only in us and price hikes outside the us market are some drawbacks on an otherwise great flagship device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,except samsung xiaomi google and motorola almost all flagships with full hd screen have hig more none of those have better endurance scores than this
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post did the buggy pixel pro destroy any flagship phone it tails behind iphone galaxy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if apple wanted to use or charging like macbooks then it would have been done al more ok so whats your point
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone ditch the dynamic island just put punch hole cam ultrasonic fingerprint more if apple wanted to use or charging like macbooks then it would have been done already
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,battery life seems really good on this for phone this size and specs it is remarkable except samsung xiaomi google and motorola almost all flagships with full hd screen have high number of battery endurance here
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,test the signal strength please rumour says samsung has better antenna but no one ever tests it officiallyreviews are crap
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still the best phone even in
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hello good people if anyone here is using the iphone pro max would sincerely appreciat more running perfect except the battery is draining quick never had green line issue mine is working flawlessly
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gsmarena where is the charger type the phone uses
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,isnt there any os update coming post are we directly getting ios as next update if more nah gotta opt for the betatest to get it im running it since few months its amacing finally more faster phone otherwise gotta wait till im not sure september to get it officially fully version otherwise its beta
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have pro max after updating ios facing battery draining and camera flickering more camera flickers in slow motion cause of your lights not being the same refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if youre upgrading from an android then iphone minimum dont bother with these more tf talking about iphone is dogshit hz display no alwayson display and lack of telephoto camera the only real successor to the pro max is the pro max when comparing the pro max to plus hands down get the pro max you dont need usbc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,beenusing this phone since june im so glad my pm still safe from gsod tbh im play some games and my phone sometimes hot or warm
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,do you guys recommend upgrading to the iph pro max from samsung yes
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this looks better than the pm and pm if they put gb ram in this it would be perfect
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,for arround euro would strongly recomend it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it would be my last ios device guess hurmmm
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,probably the last true flagship from apple the improved literally everything better build quality titanium drastically reduced the weight as well as being much more durable than the stainless steel smaller bezels more storage and ram better battery and probably the biggest upgrade usb the pro max didnt improve much over the pm but the pm is big improvement over the pm
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this and the standard pro are the last truly good iphones in my opinion best colors espec more why would you want the crappy lightning port
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,guys the iphone pro max got new notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,there is almost no value to trading in the an expensive paperweight also read that ios more have pm and upgraded to ios yes battery life is improved and cameras are just like before havent noticed any much difference however macro shots came out really great there are some temporary touch issues while expending notifications but it is like jitter phone is at stable temprature not too warm like felt in ios feel that refresh rate or smooth scrolling take hit in this version browsing and scrolling is not that smooth like ios it is not hanging or freezing but definitely not smooth let me know if anyone have similar issues
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im not happymy brand new iphone pro max bh drained from to in just one monthpl more original battery has been charged
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,same issue with me as well currently have pixel gb trying to trade off with pro max more there is almost no value to trading in the an expensive paperweight also read that ios is supposed to improve battery life and picture quality on some newer iphones read online that the pro max battery life increased by about hrs with ios does anyone have any experience with the pro max and ios for improved battery life or camera quality thanks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,considering buying used pro max gb in great shape from friend at half the original more same issue with me as well currently have pixel gb trying to trade off with pro max gb purple for dont know is it worth the upgrade
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,who else uses cinematic camera and notices that the promax gets hot with the use of the camera after long time of use
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,anyone updated to ios hows it running great recommend
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,got mine on if july and the battery is still but have display issue my screen show some little rainbow colors in dot form and disappear
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im using both iphone pro max and asus rog phone bought iphone for gaming purposes which more what do you mean by ghost touch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,how long have you been using the phone more than year batt health charge it every day around am remaining to
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes my battery drained from to in just weeksdamn how long have you been using the phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have you experienced any battery drain yes my battery drained from to in just weeksdamn
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,pro barely different
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,price for back glass repair thats so cheap why do people think its outrageou more nice okay help your boys if thats so
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,probably that applies to every iphone since iphone pro max the iphone pro max doesnt have flattened edges but rounded edges it would be from the iphone up all the phones look the same
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the iphone pro max looks nearly identical to the iphone pro max probably that applies to every iphone since iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if you dont want the or pm this phone is choice its still worth it but just wait for the tho
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its good but the battery is not that good tho yes ive heard that for some reason thd battery endurance on the pro max is worse than the pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nice try the phone is supa cool but hate the pro max the charging port is type
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes actually the battery improved after updating it is somewhat the upside of promax even more agree with youphone is heavy as compare to other brands however am used to it now the performance and other features are still outstanding and working flawlessly even my pro is working like super smooth thats what like about apple they maintain there durability and software support for the longest time unlike other mobiles which got issues in majority of phones with in months am very happy with this phone and with every update it is getting better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well am om which updated few days back must say the battery life improved lot more yes actually the battery improved after updating it is somewhat the upside of promax even though it is heavier the battery life is just amazing it is able to last me more than hours for average use kudos to that but the only downside for me is that the phone is heavy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,heavy phone but with good photo quality and portrait dof simulation if printing small xcm photos it is hard to notice that portrait was made with phone and not real full frame camera if was buying phone now would go for non max variant just because of the weight
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,big heavy brick true
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is that good aaa country code dubai phonesgive me your comments plz
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im been using samsung and apple for long time and finally give up on apple after ios im planning to buy the iphone pro max or pro max may know the reason why you no longer want to buy an iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,after using this phone for year think this is my last iphone switching to android phones more im been using samsung and apple for long time and finally give up on apple after ios

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the conclusion have reached in my opinion is that the difference between android fans and more exactly what said to my friend few days ago hearing others complaining about how iphone is waste of money and how they can get the same for half of the money with android we are both using iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hey guys need some help earlier had iphone and got pro max month ago initially more hi am too coming from pm to pm few months ago but didnt had such issues like you mentioned in fact the picture clarity and resolution is far superior the color accuracy and depth is is huge upgrade to pm am using automode or lightroom camera for manual photography may be you can check it with apple service care they are very responsive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not worth in the same boat here no def not worth it if they dont come up with some new stuff even the wont be worth it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have iphone pro max and ultra they are great on their own ways but su surprised more hi am really torn between this phones right now need to buy new phone but cant decide love mobile photography and am doing contents for facebook may know your inputs on which device should buy between this which one is better in terms of battery life and camera thanks in advance
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hell sucks that the iphone pro series only existed for one single year just for the newer pro series
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,am gamer if the iphone is better than other mobile phones in terms of gaming will buy more believe it is good device for gamers iphone pro max comes with powerful pro bionic chip with nm apple custom core graphics gm ram for the first time in iphones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just enjoy both worlds have the pro max and the vanilla couldnt be more happy have iphone pro max and ultra they are great on their own ways but su surprised me with its performance and battery life coming from su enjoy using it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so beautiful colour
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have never brought iphone before so should go for iphone pro max or wait for iphone more if you never bought an iphone why do you not look for others with much budget friendlier option lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes very worth it bro for what exactly can you really list down what you can do on this phone that you cannot do on other phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,can someone suggest mefor the first time in my life trying to buy iphone should wait for more what do want from your phone if want pro features please buy only pro version and if you do not need those features you can buy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes what are you waiting for
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,can upgrade to android or android is also ok for me please help me out yes you can just visit gsm arena customer care
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,samsung note ultra still beats this phone and its from lets do benkm more really
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,case thats heavy for phone who would get case for weightlifting
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,mr no name jul your money is worthless if iphone cant reach the battery of mah to mah so very more funny how people are still judging battery life by battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no sd card no mm jack no buy we have someone stuck in
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lots of iphone pro max battery issues of battery health percentange dropping every week or two rapidly going around many devices its absolutely true dropping around percent month or even two is unacceptable means there is battery issue previous iphones lasted years and remained always above percent max reduced battery health pro max already going to be under in under years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yea but ois its not have value of and dont think you understend what said in my come more you pay for quality it can even have mb ram if it runs better than phones with gb ram it will be more expensive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,waiting for apple to launch apple pay in india
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,sold my ip pro max got the samsung galaxy zfold if you compare its just camera little here and there mean if you are into taking only pics videos with your family friends etc this phone is crazy is also mini tablet amazing phone for everything movies social media work think its not about samsung apple fans its about the truth zfold can do lot like times more than iphone comparing everything can multitask crazy you dnt need any other device only actually wherever you go also so many free apps online as its android for watching movies social media video calling and most important millions of free apk apps available online its worth it apple is just pay for everything waste would say keep an iphone if you want photography but invest in tb samsung phone for entertainment just use iphone for photography videography if you are really into that normal people hardly take pics vids so much of others really
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you are comparing two completely different operating systems those only gb ram on ois are more yea but ois its not have value of and dont think you understend what said in my coment was said that specs value like memory cpu battery charger speed value etc are cheap and phone its expensive know ios its better but not for these price
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the problem its not people cant afford an iphone the problem is an iphone its not wor more you are comparing two completely different operating systems those only gb ram on ois are more efficient than twice the gb on androids
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is the watt charger bad for the pro max does it really spoil the battery any long term users
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone should have mah battery and zoom for the price they already answered the reason if they do that then what are they going to get to continue making money
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is actually very funny because most people criticizing apple havent actually owned an ip more the problem its not people cant afford an iphone the problem is an iphone its not worth more than half of phone price its just profit becouse specs are cheap and phone are not valuable cpu have just six cores battery its just mah its not enough memoryjust gb ram camera just mp and recording its not here usb
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,upgraded from the iphone pro to the iphone pro max indian edition silver color love it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just bought this phone it is very good but one thing am scared of is the battery then give it away to someone else ill take it and resell it for and buy something better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thats the power of rebranded exynos lol true
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yeah agree what samsung fanboy in disguise agree
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this phone has been the best investment in my life to play candy crush and face book fast any phone with atleast gb ram can do that eg iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,usb lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,when will iphones have telephoto lens they already have it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,buy sony please select one of them not anything else
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,waiting iphone cause it will change to typec hope soo but apple can do apple thing remove charging port and go full magsafe easy magsafe charger sales because apple sheeps will buy anything they will do
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,what cases do you guys use use spigen ultra hybrid case as this phone is so heavy in my pocket at work
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,best phone on the market right now had pixel pro and samsung ultra before iphone pro more own this phone and would say ultra is more versatile
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,solid device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,your money is worthless if iphone cant reach the battery of mah to mah so very overpriced phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone has just started getting hz screens finally theyre always behind the curve at apple horrible rip off exploitative company
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,am running to get my at device shop now
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes agree coming from pp battery lasted hours and overheated in ac cooled room lo more thats the power of rebranded exynos lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,overall phone is smooth nd camera is too cool but problem with battery drains fast nd fone get heat too quickly
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have used this phone for while my first iphone coming from pixel pro love it more yes agree coming from pp battery lasted hours and overheated in ac cooled room loved the camera though
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple never changes the specs of their phones just little things change and apple fans are more yup agree
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its crap if we play offline videos and open the camera for five minutes its heat to much
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hello apple fanboy no doubt apple iphones are just great but how great is it when fake iphon more what is this bot even typing lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ya all apple products iphone airpods applewatch copies are available in thousands of brands no more better than apple lmao dont push your luck is that why see everyone recommending used watch straps instead of third party garbage for example
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post every phone purchased since got to cyprus was gotten from allgadgets the main reason patronize them is cus can get refund if change my mind after purchase
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is not even out and your comparing your joke man hello apple fanboy no doubt apple iphones are just great but how great is it when fake iphone copies are able to match the body of iphone hard to tell difference only through software inside apple is trillion dollar company and others making copies are not even in usd thousand dollar company budget are able to come close so funny here and apple are limiting so much like no dual whatsapp or just any dual app no multitasking cannot use multiple apps etc so much limitations because this hardware just cant do that they know it for that they need gb ram onwards also apple is making iphone ios software since so many years still if there is excuse then please all laugh as they are making only few models hardly unlike other brands like samsung mi etc who makes thousands all do have little here and there but apple has like crazy expectations there are memes of you had one job which applies here they are stuck because of gb ram no proper cooling technology inside their devices because anything they think of adding becomes like ok so we added this now usd increase on the device because now they have become super premium and expensive so expecting the next iphone in to have dual apps multitasking as this year they wont because they have launched the apple vision pro so expect in to have actually extremely powerful iphone trust me on this one its guarantee
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,upgraded from pro max to pro max for over month updated to ios beta more you do realized beta ios might unstable right why would you update to ios beta then complaint device become poop
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphones with tb storage gb gb are the best because majority of complaints only are on gb storage and lower with tb device the iphone never had issues because it has lots of free space and it does matter because it also keeps the battery going produces less heat as less load so always opt for tb or gb because common the photos videos apps sizes are reaching like in gb with all the high resolution this that small hi res videos are going for less than minute and sizes are in lots of gb so there is super load on the phone which we dont know but its happening only we know as experts in this line for like years so always get tb and any android or iphone get pro max now tb great deals less price and also android new phones upcoming are gb tb with gb ram in prices like usd range brands like realme redmagic oneplus etc seriously not kidding
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,only if you wanna blow it upa good old watts charger is reccomendable thats not how chargers work devices pull power chargers dont push you could use charger and be fine
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dont believe you lol you were not using samsung some android users have not used fla more youre totaly right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,can charge this phone with charger only if you wanna blow it upa good old watts charger is reccomendable
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,settings select your wifi click on button and drag down to config dns and then select manual more thanks lot bro this is one expensive phone and after spending ton on it was worried that im facing this issue this method worked in an instant thanks again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,would agree your statement many people jump from budget android to ios that doesnt make any sense from my experience would say android is smoother than ios had test one ui as well as stock android both animation are smoother than ios the performance parts of ip pro is worst the gaming at high setting is subpar idk its sw issue or not the most frustrating thing is that the after sale service the apple hesitate to repair old iphone even changing battery display of iphone they would reject the repair and force you to buy new coming to new model the display replacement cost of ip series is about th of the phones price aftermarket repairs are not great experience but costs very less so many reasons to hate apple the entirely locked ios is crazy the android platform feels more vast so you must use samsung pixel flagship devices then you would feel the level of refinement and customization
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hate ios everything is just restricted just hate the newer iphone the phone is heavier sorry its the heaviest one the after safe service is crap they will tell to scrap your phone and buy new one rather than repair the display replacement would cost about the price of phone subpar would say ipad is the best tablet but iphone not at all beet phone its the ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,find this funny comment actually since bought this phone days ago and this is my first more dont believe you lol you were not using samsung some android users have not used flagship android they just jump from android to iphone and they start comparing
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,for reviews thats pretty long term considering most tech youtubers and reviewers will review them after using it for day or week max and never revisit it later or give it longer trial these types of videos are pretty useful if youre the type of person to wait months or longer to upgrade when there are sales and whatnot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hi guys me and my mum purchase this phone together at same store but however when using siri my mums siri unable to recognize certain commands like power off for shutdown option my siri has no problem both our pm already updated to latest ver and already checking siri search settings both setting are same how to fix it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hi guyz just need some advice have samsung and looking for which phone to upgrade more which one did you buy in the end
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,all answer is nopexd aww man what bummer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,be careful if you own iphone heard they might blow up be careful what kinda updates happe more from where did you your info from your
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just got an iphone pro max and the gaming experience is really good but just the fact that more switch off location and tracking including app refresh in background thanks me later
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is that worth it to upgrade from iphone to pro max worth is subjective and is directly correlated to your income yes the pro max has improvements over the pro max it only depends if these improvements are worth it to you and your pocket
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,noice thanks lot consider about pro at september you choosy and clumsy fella think its better for you to buy iphone se just nice for you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post no had many budget xiaomi phones all were good my mi max is still super fast
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,na outside the camera improvements theres not much to justify the move like the performa more noice thanks lot consider about pro at september
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cant use iphone its closesource they might be monitoring everyoneevery country even me fear
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,spyros may coming from huawei pro which dumped due to the lack of gms services was satisfied wit more it wont but there are many gms emulators out there plus you have app galery
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,take it from me ive had both phones but had to sell phone pronot max because it was too more find this funny comment actually since bought this phone days ago and this is my first time expierincing ios find it pretty user friendly compared to android where settings are all over the place and dont even make sense to begin with have been using samsung for years now
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,looking for long battery life and good taking photos videos then only su and iphone pro max is your choices su suc with battery video stabilization compared to those two su especially with exynos is super bad even on performance side compared with newer models using snapdragon
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if the ultra is still available in your area and is more cheaper than the ultra sugg more looking for long battery life and good taking photos videos
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,complicated really and other android users complain that iphone is so simple have both more agree with you but its more complicated if you are trying to use all features from android because there are way more features than iphone has on the other hand if you only use facebook and instagram there are difference between them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so very over price phone your money is not worth if apple iphones cant reach the mah battery capacity very scam company since the real founder died
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,amazeballs battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,tutti phone slow charging
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,prefer ultraios is way too complicated to use because youre probably used to one ui
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hi all being professional in this testing devices to extreme for ages now all apple or all more presumably samsung have negotiated this extended android update cycle with google apple do not have this problem so as long as the phone can support it is universal my only other comment is usb type ports would expect apple to include lightening to type adapter rather than type cable imo type makes many apple cable redundant immediately the adapter does not not gamer but literally fell in love with the asus simply by its design have to admit that he asus review was the first time looked at an asus asus will be forefront when upgrade
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its not apple if the battery capacity isnt random numbers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bruh lighting cable alone make me not even consider buying it as over using type phone more for me always have power bank with both lightning and usb attached to it also carry mini magsafe power bank for data transfer use either google drive to exchange files between my computer and my devices not rich just had to buy an android as my is failing lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hello why are so many debates over whether ios is or not better than android or iphone is or not better then samsung beets me have used android on google pixel and think android has evolved in very good os only go to use android once in while cause of their very customizable interface witch on iphone is totally absent but after while need to go back to ios why just because ios has faster user interface would like ios to be multitasking split view that is what am missing from iphones and android had that years or maybe decade ago prefer mac os rather than windows prefer linux rather than windows why cause of their flat user interface and terminal interface apple asks for their products way too much in term of specs mean usb what joke meen not being able to use your storage capacity like mount your god damn storage on pc mac and copy the god damn thing but only via cloud what joke but if android could give me that instant app opening that crashless environment like ios gives to users would use only android still in android cannot offer that and that is why am using ios using pro max tb pixel but only for apps that are not available on ios prefer using linux then macos and last windows only for apps that do not work on first two first time poster on this site did this cause of lot of hate that posts contains samsung this and that iphone this and that better first better last sucks first sucks last its better what you like and thats it cheers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,waste of money to upgrade only little difference from to how huge different do you want it to be so different till you couldnt recognize if it even an iphone anymore
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,continuing iphones keep coming with mixed internals leftover from the last ones to make sure they use their old stock in the new ones they do that if they have leftover bionic chips they put in new ones or the display screen or whatever so by they will use all then later it will be completely new all parts of the phone so try saving buying the iphone in october november
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,those buying this iphone other than usa version does not even have mmwave also usa version has esim slots battery life is highest only in this model as its ios is tuned well worst is hongkong chinese version japan version is quite balanced but mmwave is the best with superb network reception and speed as well as best battery the good part is the brightness loudness of the phone there has been no issues with tb iphone actually as it performs the best compared to and gb due to more storage its quite faster doesnt lag but iphone sucks in countries in outdoor with degree celsius up as it just overheats many other android phones come with internal cooling coils so thats the difference as iphone just stops working also one more thing to sum it all up iphone is the best for clicking person pics vids but other phones do well clicking outdoor pics like ultra mi ultra new vivo new oppo new nova huawei flagships so iphone concentrates once iphone gets gb gb ram dual whatsapp or messenger with cooling coil inside it will be like worldwide sale as no other phone will match that believe there wont be iphone they could change the name there so could be last dont think series name they would come up with thats the one to buy as it will be like completely new as the current iphones keep coming with mixef internals
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,fantastic joke winner in irrelevancy maybe close contender with the folds and flips can you give facts what is irrelevant exactly do you know what it means or just your arrogant hate speaks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,one thing didnt mention is their joke of an attempt at an ecosystem they will never more they are actually at the same level of apple seamless integration in their ecosystem even if you dont like it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,samsung is the standard in how to not make good operating system and how to shove efuses in more apple is the standard for that samsung is now the standard of how to create good operative system stop putting invalid excuses
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,in reality ios is complicated joke android is better organized why are app settings located more just bought this phone and new to iphone and not even day yet already have big sigh using this now files transfer such joke too many limitation for preisntall iphoneapple apps especially media apps
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cant beat samsung samsung is the standard now samsung have as well seamless integrat more samsung is the standard in how to not make good operating system and how to shove efuses in every part of your phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ultra is clear winner fantastic joke winner in irrelevancy maybe close contender with the folds and flips
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,anyhow iphone ios still the best mobile phone than any other android devices very premium more isnt better compared to samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the apple iphone pro max is quite simply the standard by which all other phones are measure more cant beat samsung samsung is the standard now samsung have as well seamless integration and old flagship samsung phones beat other phones that arent samsung or iphones samsung is years ahead
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone shows good performance
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hi guys just want to ask if any of you use the always on display will soon upgrade from more just bought my pro max yesterday and seems like theres no difference at all whether it is on or off
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,did anyone notice that from iphone to iphone its the same mp camera when samsung is giving mp thats insane dont tell me about the quality used both
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,which one has better battery between the iphone pro max and pro max in real life in my use the pm has better battery life take it off the charger at am and when leave work at pm it still has battery this never happened when had the pm
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ill give my opinion of the samsung ultra vs iphone pro max debate as have has more which one has better battery between the iphone pro max and pro max in real life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the speaker on this phone is the bomb so loud and perfect right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,th stereo speaker on the pro max is amazing
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,one problem with this phone is that sometimes it gets stuck on certain amount of battery and after turning off the phone how many percent of the battery is reduced checked everything the battery health is
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,look so tough and high constantcy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,uh you can download stuff in the background you dont even have iphone so you dont get to say more correct
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,specs dont always correlate with performance you know that apple phones have better op more there is catch ios is not real multitasking cant download anything on background where as android can
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,good unfortunately no one will care iphone sales are the only smartphone sales that is risin more specs dont always correlate with performance you know that apple phones have better optimization thats why the android phones need gb of ram to do what an iphone will do with gb
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yeah ios is way too complicated to use if you are used to anroidmost people buy them because of the brand name not the specsi am an infinix user and im satisfied with it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,coming from huawei pro which dumped due to the lack of gms services was satisfied with the iphone until it started to drop the battery health percentage from the nd month now own it for months and its on had my huawei pro for years and it is still on very dissapointed from apple on this matter and many androidhuawei features missing on ios making it not so easy to use no fast charging is joke and photos at nights arent so good as the pro are making me consider my purchase if playstore comes back to huawei devices im definetely switching again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,beautiful mobile
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,when bought this phone the battery life was horrible for first weeks now with always on screen off or on get hour battery standby time and hours of on screen time on off mode connect the phone for changing when it is at one thing can say that my old pro max is still better with battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,honestly ive been both and android user and now and iphone user one of the big differen more galaxy ss still performing great even after years and still can run pubg well as the iphone xsxs max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,was using the pro max since launch when the ultra came switched to try the phone more in reality ios is complicated joke android is better organized why are app settings located in general settings every app must have their own settings in them and lot more
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple is under boycott from me on my blacklist then if they offered too buy me money use there more good unfortunately no one will care iphone sales are the only smartphone sales that is rising instead of falling even as an android fan cant deny the fact that the majority prefers iphones even if the only reason is the brand name and not the specs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone is better yes iphone pro max is berger than plusbut ultra and other android flagdhifts are niles awsy grom any iphonefor yeats iphone will nemaybe where are android phineas today
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow thats absolutely amazing you deserve medal an actor shapeshifts into an iphone in movie
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,legends know ultra is far superior battery is out standing with great camera perform iphone is better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,anyone experiencing battery drain after the latest os update yes but still good to me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nope people on gsmarena want petabyte phone with an sd card slot well you see the internal storage capacity wouldnt matter much if it was expandable people would lose their crap if pc maker made pc with soldered on memory and no expansion ports why its not the same for phones is beyond me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this phone sure is heavy but the weigh of the phone to me feel it reflects the price tag absolute in power
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,what everyone know fingerprint is more accurate and reliable and also is times faster than more plus if you have fingerprint you dont have to take up your phone from the desk to use it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,idiots fingerprint is downgrade compared to face id from apple its more secure and more what everyone know fingerprint is more accurate and reliable and also is times faster than face id compared to second
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ok so just thing here own apple since xs max own olny pro max series this is grea more dont charge until its very bad to your iphone battery and please charge before this is best way to save your iphone battery health this is good way to protect your iphone battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,for most people yes for people on gsmarena no nope people on gsmarena want petabyte phone with an sd card slot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,most of the comments and replies are from android users coming here just to diss the iphone more you must be blind then apple users are always ragging on android and its users so the jealousy goes both ways
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,are you comparing face id with fingerprints every fingerprint is unique and also its more more idiots fingerprint is downgrade compared to face id from apple its more secure and easy to use
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well over for the same phone year in year out was iphone from up to stopped using iphone as it became apparent that apple are nothing more than cash grab that offer nothing new in their latest phones they lock everything down to apple so you cant use existing hardware when will the iphone lovers open their eyes im not an advocate for samsung as have htc and have never owned samsung but iphone is in the shade when it compares to samsung and when you look at what get on my htc desire pro for even my phone is better deal than any apple phone which are going for over grand my old phone huawei mate pro walks all over any apple phone may well have got another mate pro if the uk didnt cancel them android walks all over apple but whats the old saying love is blind
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,stupid face id do you have any idea what your talking about its not same as face id on more have huawei model with finger print and dmfsce id challenging iphone huge price
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,guys gb is very low storage those who do photographyvideography dont know why more buy gb at least you will miss pro res video with gb version
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,source android fans source reality you can find out how ipad pro has or gb memory because of multi tasking iphone has no multitasking
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is gb enough for most people yes for people on gsmarena no
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,which camera was used to take these photos of iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ios is not real multi tasker cant download or upload in background so gm ram is en more source android fans
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,sameoldbrandnewugly junk for brainlleesss ijombees
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wait apple will come out with new handset in september much anticipated feature for me is that type for iphone series if this series comes with type will wait another years to price drop to buy this
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yura jr mar not only is this phone big chunky awkward to use it is absolutely hideous mind you have more so you did not know how big inches is before you got the device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the apple problem is common to gsm arena and its means of testing cameras generally first we more have feeling youre mixing traditional photography with these modern computional ones found on smartphones and they are similar but not quite the same they cant be the same as phones will always have few important limiting factors with their dimensions being the main one anyways from my understanding we shouldnt benefit from having high pixel sensor only because we want more details not only because we wont get much more of it anyway but because thats not the main reason why we have multibayer sensors in the first place the main reason is photography in dark or bad lighting situations it all started with one huawei phone and their great collab with sony to make custom sensor for their premium flagship phone cant remember was it pro or mate pro but one of them came with for that time big mp size quad bayer sensor with having for very long time unmatched results in already mentioned very dark conditions since then everybody else just followed the suit ps like your idea about viewing and downloading taken photos using raw files at their resolution on this site so thumbs up for that cheers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the dynamic island is punch hole its literally the punch hole from the more from my understanding almost all android phones have punch hole or an island not dynamic one just an island mostly in the shape of round hole so theyre not exactly the same as on iphones as punch holes on android dont have another purpose then just being hole in screen for selfie camera you can also say iphones have dynamic punch hole because their hole or island is really dynamic one cheers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not only is this phone big chunky awkward to use it is absolutely hideous mind you have used this phone gb and the interface is cartoonlike with its big symbols
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes they have the stupid face id garbage because theyre too stubborn to use fingerprint more stupid face id do you have any idea what your talking about its not same as face id on android phones face id on iphone is one of advanced tech and its most avance security than old but works finger print
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,less ram amount then budget android phone but noone else cares at all its and people still base their opinions on specsheets
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,agree samsung basically has the same level of performance in battery cpu etc but also has th more fair enough have good day
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,would love to see phone users swap their phone to samsung ultra to see if they wou more have used the ultra for weeksborrowed from my friend and do like its soc upgrade you definitely can feel the smoothness while heavytasking but something about ippm is that it feels more refined or stable for me even though do have faced few bugs here and therei honestly think the amount of customization apple is giving rn is enough for me about the cameras prefer the videos of iphone even though the difference is quite small and pictures are definitely better on su in most cases especially in nighttimesamsung with qhd gave amazing battery backup and iphone was close to itso overall iphone def has the edge over ultra for me bcz of iosgotta give props to samsung for the su though
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yes bcoz cant download or upload anything in background android is true multi tasking more seems like the android fanboys dont know how to use ios if they think your statement is true
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gb on ios is comparable to like on android ios is not real multi tasker cant download or upload in background so gm ram is enough for it android is best for customization
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,mostly posted comments are non sense issues and they keep on comparing every phonethis was supposed to be giving opinions and comments of this particular model and brand making opinions and comments on other phone you might go and search for that particular brand and model just saying
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ios doesnt need as much ram though that and the instant updates are some of its strong more yes bcoz cant download or upload anything in background android is true multi tasking phone ultra is current king
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,tried the camera out on this because friend of my mom came to my little bros birthday yesterday and man the pics took are pretty outstanding imo and with proraw enabled theyre really awesome
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,mate know you might hate me for this the ultra is also beast and it will cost less tha more agree samsung basically has the same level of performance in battery cpu etc but also has things iphone doesnt have and it makes it better for me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ooooohh want to buy one also but gonna wait for the my is still kickin mate know you might hate me for this the ultra is also beast and it will cost less than the iphone iphone are either going to kill samsung or match its power have never used and iphone but samsung in my opinion is bit better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just bought onespace black ooooohh want to buy one also but gonna wait for the my is still kickin
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no its not your just stpd punch hole is puch hole iphone have the most advance security more yes they have the stupid face id garbage because theyre too stubborn to use fingerprint scanners
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im huawei user started using it when tried the mate pro but since the lack of more sad for you condolences for going back to the darkness
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ugly notch at least samsung has only punch pole yes indeed because samsung has tiny camera while apple have the most advanced authentication system there your point is stpd
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,worst phone everplease dont buy just bought onespace black
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,says someone who has never even used the phone judging by the specs and review itself its already not worth the price
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,agree pro sucks says someone who has never even used the phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,said man with roblox avatar does it look like we care about that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im using my phone with sim and nano sim battery life is ok thanks lot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone is so expensive without feature like punchhole display optical zoom full customizin more you definitely dont even know what punch hole is this has one the but bigger and is at the centre
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if were talking worst bang for your buck think that award might just go to the phantom more agree pro sucks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,best bang for your buck iphone in for about any suggestions
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so expensive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,whats that garbage that isnt worth mentioning
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so it doesnt exist fine if say so
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,as matter of fact it does it was just cancelled so it doesnt exist
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,great battery life superb speed great photos not like or same ultra hahahhahaha
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,then ill name one for you the energizer power pk pop doesnt exist you had one job
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,does anyone have experience with dual sim usage on this phone how does it appear what about more im using my phone with sim and nano sim battery life is ok
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no sd card no buy ok then dont buy it no ones stopping you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just smell lots of jealousy in your comment people loves different phones people have diff more its seems like you are manufacturer of iphone dont get panic could see how many times you repeating the same wierd words copy paste
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,people want reliability they want consistency they want to be able to pull out their phone and make call send text take photo etc without having to think twice regardless of what iphone you pick they just work in that very basic sense im lover of phones not brand loyalist in any way but ill always prefer to use an iphone for that reason actually one of my main reasons is can type so much faster on an iphone than any other keyboard if could and if had the need to would love to work across my pro max and pixel pro or ultra but thats just not practical
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,definitely not worth the money the ultra costs less than this piece of and it more but youd get the same thing though no charging brick just the unit usb to cables and manuals
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ya your comment is actually sad just cause you dont like the iphone it doesnt make it bad lo more everything is up to you your personal preference most android fan boys love pixel samsung coz it had tons of features customisation great camera there are many ios fan boys who love ios doesnt need much customisation with great camera set up
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,doubt between this and ultra battery life of iphone is much better but ultra more if you are after longevity for years its of course iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,who else is having issues with whatsapp and the camera issue unable to use camera from within whatsapp
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dynamic island dissapear how
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,like iphone before dinosaur in earth
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,isnt heavy at all undestand that is kg
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this my latest phone the best right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why people love iphone positive answer because its iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nobody needs capable phone is not gonna happen
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so what does that supposed to mean valuable if you are talking about reselling then you more if you didnt buy it that doesnt involve in reselling value at the first place dont just attack people
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone se version rd gen is faster on gfxbench iphone pro max fps iphone se fps
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yeah all right it is definitely heavier than most other typical phones and if you compare more dont get people why argue in the reviews its just phone dont care if its heavy bright and they are just making up problems for their own boundaries
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this phone look so nice and valueable so what does that supposed to mean valuable if you are talking about reselling then you get higher value when you dont buy anything at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still iphone steal your heart if only you touch it it its so beautiful
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still heavy gr weight isnt heavy at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this pro max will be my next iphone after near year on older iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ugly notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone is great on display the alwayson display thing though might drain some battery however its optional
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,was wondering if it is posible to put gms in my iphone just want the cover
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,only poor people have top specced phones the poor mentality is so destructi more just smell lots of jealousy in your comment people loves different phones people have different taste regardless of poor or rich people love iphone because it is solid phone with lots of good features people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware if you take look google is trying to do that as well with his pixel phones ios android etc whatever works for you is the best again different people different choices
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphones arent for rich people it is for poor people since they are only ones who flex more only poor people have top specced phones the poor mentality is so destructive only the broke people flex iphones meanwhile samsung and being the most common phones worldwide
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hello friend apple was the first company to introduce fingerprint scanner on its phone after more pantech gi it has touch id
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lol this phone is joke just use this website to compare stats from samsungs ultra more tbh its battle of the specs apple has more raw speed longer battery and better os support usually between years of ios updates samsung has better cameras and way better display tech not to mention they sell phones at all price points just depends on what you want in phone ps if you want new flagship wait for vivo pro global release its poggers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its depends on your location would advise buying cell phone signal booster for such more may be because iphone shows exact signla strength instead of fake
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,says the jealous android user jealous of what if they wanted an iphone theyd just get one your response is fairly idiotic
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,and oh my god how slow do they get after about years of use hard pass lol nice information for more detail visit httpswwwgsmarenacompostopinionphpidphoneidopinion

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone and still no fingerprint scanner when apple finally puts it on their phones all th more hello friend apple was the first company to introduce fingerprint scanner on its phone after that every smartphone company they copied it and now apple they removed it because face id works more fine then fingerprint scanner

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,only their macs ipads and preiphone devices have touch id iphone series dont have touch id

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bionic much better than the latest sd gen need benchmarks too find out winner but as apple dont even give barely any cooling or ram paired with it the hardware just not much good just apple hides that with ios dont even know for sure if could win as gaming tests show snapdragon is more powerful every time in the past tests saw plus android can overclock the snapdragon so struggle too see apple winning even if added cooling was added by the user
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,but they want it exactly they only want it for bragging rights
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gtpharouq dec still doesnt record in lol nobody needs capable phone

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wish that they would update the design little bit because they used the same thing for the iphone and now the only difference that see is that it has slightly more powerful chipset and brand new type of notch to make fun of love the iphones and the androids and have respect for both the same but it feels though the android just has more diversity and options and functionality at this point they come out with cool new designs and each new major android update changes something cool about it sure the lock screen changed in ios wich is cool but that was needed for long while now it just feels like they need to venture out bit more like they did with the mini that was pretty cool phone felt comfortable was fast and cheaper than there main set of iphones apart for the iphone se of course also animated wallpaper would have been good replacement as apposed to just removing it in general in all would hope they do the iphone better to be an iphone that would be worth upgrading to
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the best of the best dont talk bad about it if you havent used it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this is last iphone to come with an outdated lightning connector feel sorry for those who more from what ive heard and read it might be only from iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,when iphone with usb is there it will surely affect how you see your iphone with ancie more absolutely agree with you also of same opinion the lightning cable is year old tech and apple is minting on the same tech time for usbc rather thunderbolt speeds
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thats all pure speculation other than usbc which is only mandatory in the eu market more when iphone with usb is there it will surely affect how you see your iphone with ancient lightning have iphone promax and will wait for or any iphone with usb one cable for all of my gadgets and cable speed transfers will be clutch as do videoedits airdroping several videofiles is cumbersome and just takes so long and with price increase in eu it is definitely not good buy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,watch arun video iphone vs android battery test httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvf more bro did even watch the full video it clearly shows that iphone pro max was the winner of the test
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,on test was manufactured by tsmc and it still didnt beat apple watch arun video iphone vs android battery test httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvfyaacenmk
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,considering thunderbolt uses the same connection as usbc and both can be used it pretty muc more iphone uses lightning connector which is completely different from thunderblot or usbc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hmm it seems had no idea why android lost in battery this year said again snapdragon more on test was manufactured by tsmc and it still didnt beat apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why not why should suffer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,that restricted filesystem mentioned was some apps couldnt access files like hex editor more why do see you everywhere
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this is why have been so harsh of apple really hate it mainstream android brands follow more that restricted filesystem mentioned was some apps couldnt access files like hex editor and you cant access android data and obb folder as well so you no longer put large games that have seperate parts like apk obb sd card aceess is starting to act up
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im losing faith with android too due to its restricted filesystem couldnt put large games more this is why have been so harsh of apple really hate it mainstream android brands following in apple foot steps of anti features like you mentioned restricted filesystem on android can you explain the problem in detail see if have the same problems on the later versions of android after android
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ultra got samsung microsoft blootware heavy skins oneul and crappy exynos processor more ist true samsung have microsoft bloatware what bloatware then we better to avoid samsung one ui os in future my friends also told me one ui isnt prefect for security and privacy for long period of usage thank god for your comment
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dude apple literally beats android in battery see some battery tests first hmm it seems had no idea why android lost in battery this year said again snapdragon gen soc was manufacturer by samsung instead of tsmc so it drain battery quickly but even said it im pretty sure still dont get it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is not about battery size other factors also matter iphone pro even beat in battery ultra got samsung microsoft blootware heavy skins oneul and crappy exynos processor and small battery no wonder it beats ultra not very hard too beat or much of achievement asus rog pro beats iphone in battery life and has more reasonable size battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bruh android already won against iphone over years in terms of battery and this time at more dude apple literally beats android in battery see some battery tests first
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone no match for android in turns of battery apple dont even stand chance in batt more is not about battery size other factors also matter iphone pro even beat in battery
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,heres the problem android manufacturers keep copying apples storage markups and more apples software is so much more optimized apple is nothing special just ios is lighter than android most android alternatives can run more smoothly than android on less powerful hardware this is more android system requirements problem google made android just so heavy and demanding on system resources android has lot of problems with ram management system and so problems with low end hardware being chosen by manufacturers most android brands under spec there smartphones leading too problems with sluggish performance checked system requirements for android minimum gb of ram yet many android smartphones are build budget smartphones with less than gb of ram android shouldnt be this heavy in the first place google should not made android this heavy needing this much ram this is really bad and android skins on top of this by manufacturers surely dont help with this and newer version of android are getting even worse for this with this problem android is going downhill fast also and is on the fast track too become as heavy as full desktop windows os as for battery life going into settings and using power saver mode and customize few settings its possible get android too be just as efficient as iphone if not better android can have very good battery life this huge strength of android battery life is performance is also strength of android android smartphone is like full mini desktop os workstation battlestation and gaming machine and its really more pc like android os very high ram amounts gb ram overclocking the processor and active cooling system and ssd storage android is more for power users heavy users and does have very strong multi tasking capacitys and running emulators and virtual machines the gaming smartphone are very easily recommendation for me as they dont suffer from the short comings or anti features problems of mainstream brands and there hardware is good so android runs smoother and faster on them and android sweet spot is gb ram amount but could benefit from even more ram if it was available do think google needs fix the ram resources problem of apps being unable too be storaged in cold storage as they just cant help but use system resources in the background nightmare on budget smartphones plus the os ui browser all fighting over the same ram bandwidth this huge problem under gb of ram on android phone just suffer with sluggish performance and reloading same pages again from the start android is aimed at different market too ios thats just for camera and social media watching videos
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the tesla pi phone is coming ram tb storage apple bout to be knocked outta the game nearly missed this comment maybe its possible tesla phone looks premium its more premium brand than apple so theres that apple fans often want what is the most expensive or luxury although apple fans are very loyal too apple and think think with there heart not there head so who knows there was study on apple fans that said apple fans believe in apple being better in the same kinda way religionous people believe in religion as show in the brain as well crazy stuff so there is no way too reason with there biased opinions its very deeply rooted
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,theres still fundamental reason why ill always keep choosing android it allows more on ios you can play mp files stored on iphone there is apps with mp offline player like flacbox for years never used itunes sync dont talk about you dont know
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple gone downhill so much over the years think android users switching too iphone are ins more heres the problem android manufacturers keep copying apples storage markups and other apples antifeatures and apples software is so much more optimized that it needs less ram and less battery to do the same thing and get the same battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ever heard of something called root my phone is still under warranty so dont wanna root my main device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,endurance rating with calls web browsing and video playback dang that more im losing faith with android too due to its restricted filesystem couldnt put large games deleting the file need requires proper file manager mm jack first removed earphones in the box then the charging brick whats next removing the unit others might defend by using that excuse of removing mm jack like analog sound is bad bla bla bla charging brick causing pollution bs you had to buy them seperately anyway whats with that about saving the environment more cardboard they removed sd card in order to promote using their crappy cloud service if want the most feature need would better considering myself galaxy tb version most android midrangers dont have sd card yet they gave gb maximum is gb or even tb ufs chip really that expensive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thought the same bit after years of samsung galaxy phones gave up my ultra is go more samsung galaxy phones are not the cream of the crop for android do have the exynos version samsung galaxy phones are run oneul that is said too be heavy google pixel got tensor also bad processor before people suggested pixel phones android does have really bad ram management system so slow does happen unfortunately gaming smartphone do have higher overall specs then android flagships best too think of them as extreme flagships gb ram tb storage active fans overclock snapdragon processors etc so much better than regular phones overall
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you would buy android phone if you cannot afford iphone since then apple still selling exp more don think you know what you are talking about over here who told you apple is the most expensive phone get serious and stop playing
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have nothing to say
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,tbh iphone nowadays doesnt show any attractiveness to the users who seek to express themselves samsungs new flippables look cooler and different in my pov
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im just curious other than interface customizability and scoped storage what has googl more used to be able to show cpu usage info in developer options cant do that anymore cant tell what apps can or cant be loaded on startup accessibility usage for apps outside of play store goodbye foss apps malware has already been able to get around this this is all that can think of but know that it will likely slowly just increase and increase in the future
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yet google keeps slowly stripping away the freedoms we used to have with android im just curious other than interface customizability and scoped storage what has google done in the past years to take away our freedoms wait one more thing thought of removing old apps that still work from the play store google copying apple once again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im saying this as an android fanboy im losing faith in android and while more in my opinion android was more appealing to me years ago than it is today thats what made me switch to it back then android was the peak and fell from there android was the last version that am tolerating before root just to disable things dont like in android and to get some freedom back nowadays if was using ios wouldnt really feel like there is big reason to switch with the newest versions of android apps seem to only be able to access two places know of downloads and documents sd card whats that cant let an app use an sd card at all from my experience only folders in internal storage what does this do to protect my data compared to simply choosing what folder an app can access in internal storage or my sd card dont know it makes me mad enough to root though
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple died when steve jobs did what are you saying
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,copying apple both copy each others and many idea after that all started by android apple more if there is anything to sum up the copying then apple is copying android by catching up to android on features hz aod while android keeps copying the worst of apples antifeatures by removing the headphone jack and microsd slot and trying to oversimplify the ui to remove functionality to compete with ios
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well actually samsung the or note series anyways cost more than iphone but ive be more used to be samsung fan once myself really enjoyed them but got bored with the same old so switched to apple myself must admit im enjoying the experience with them when first tried an iphone years ago didnt enjoy the experience years on took risky leap and tried it ok like any os it has its naggles and gripes and it takes bit of time getting used to using new os but find the os lot quicker opening apps browsers even the battery life is good probably down to streamlining being better without them having worry about adapting apps to run on different phones that run android the keyboard isnt perfect but then find its far better than samsungs and theres always always the option of being able to download an alternative one such as gboard swiftkey etc started off with iphone pro max upgraded to the iphone pro max which im very impressed with the battery life plus it doesnt take forever to bring out announced os updates or they dont constantly shift update dates like found with samsung not sure if ill switch to iphone pro max though from what ive read and heard if you can put with the big notch on the iphone pro max and it does not bother you then apparently its not worth the upgrade really not sure how true that is
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if steves jobs know this he will angry to the former ceo of apple because of his not creative more apple died when steve jobs did
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,for the mp to mp conversion what was the process used kindly tell thanks this question was for the gsmarena team what was the process that was particularly used to convert the mp pro raw photos to mp photos in the camera photo quality section kindly tell thanks again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple has excellent app optimization due running on their own os android phones have to rely more you would buy android phone if you cannot afford iphone since then apple still selling expensive phone and the countries cannot afford suffer the most android phone is phone that everyone can afford
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone screen is very easily breakable wo apple care it will not be worth the money this more not sure about the credibility of that statement is there any evidence or at least article testing this
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hello ladies and gents have question and didnt get any clear answer even though more hi all us models are esims
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,get an android then apple will never do expandable storage hell they even removed the sim more are you on drugs dynamic island exists on android since from huawei and lg phones apple just animated while minimizing app notification bar from android heck even my years old galaxy note has dynamic island like behavior which is better since you can move the app icon while app minimized anywhere on the screen not just on top of the screen
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,am in big problems my problem is this when received or make calls my microphone didn more ohh
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,do even live in usa if dont its fine only usa doesnt have sim card slot live in new jersey
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple should make foldable variant of iphone rumor has that they are making some prototypes and they prefer the clam shell form like the galaxy zflip there are also rumors that they will release fold version of ipad first to see the reaction of the consumers before actually deciding to roll out the foldable iphones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple should provide me with punch hole display together with stylus pen for drawing my man whats keeping you from buying either note ultra or ultra from samsung they are designed exactly for such needs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,truth be told that article is kinda patheticly written with click baity title since the more hear you but apple also stole he notch from sharp and essential as those two were the first on the market respectively to introduce the notch apple also stole the smartwatch from samsung even though must admit they have done an even more impressive job than the originator and as somebody pointed out many years ago apple stole notifications and widgets from android an apple evangelist once said that apple usually pirate features from others but the difference is that apple perfects them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,got some bug while it in slient mode it make loud music game in background as in general mode
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone pro max physical dual sim version exist
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,my iphone pro max camera keep switching when doing video but pro max doesnt switching as in
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,funny you will change this statement few years later when apple finally adds fingerprint scan more when make statement stand by it until actual proofevidence invalidating it comes along adding face id and touch id is too costly first of all second of all as my previous postreply when two biometric security options are added one or both is either watered down and doesnt have very options plus apple is innovative if they did what others are doing the apple android war will be turned bro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,having two biometric security options is dumb honestly both are either watered down or one is more funny you will change this statement few years later when apple finally adds fingerprint scanner to the face id
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,when tech utuber doing ip pro max battery comparison against android they didnt even mention how bad is sd gen fabricated by samsungnot fair
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,how the hell do you manage to make hole that big and not even put an ultrawide camera in it to make it worse camera is just dot while other thing is face id other than that its perfect
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im not getting any where near hours of av time on the battery after hours of regular more the hour rating that gsmarena gave this phone is not representative of the actual endurance of the phone it wont last hours but itll last pretty long in fact hours and only lost is brilliant figure regular androids dont get much more than to hours before they completely shut off
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,did you just realize that every iphone that has that has notch like that doesnt have fingerp more having two biometric security options is dumb honestly both are either watered down or one is just use one and get good quality
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wait so this phone which cost dollars does not have fingerprint scanner what did you just realize that every iphone that has that has notch like that doesnt have fingerprint scanner
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the first ever complaint on the phone ratio
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,headjack phone is thing of the past mate very now have sony bt headphone wi more audio jack is very useful for video recording it is actually feature for compact cameras like sony zv and canon gx but apple dont care because its target audience are the masses would be nice if it had it though since it compliments its great video capabilities
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone will copy android battery percentage in status bar the older iphone models like the iphone all had the battery percentage indicator apple just removed it on the iphone series and again readded it with ios your only argument is that they will copy the battery indicator like lol what
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,youre paying dollars for phone want the charger in the box headphone jack more get an android then apple will never do expandable storage hell they even removed the sim card slot point is apple does their own thing and its likely within years or so android companies will copy xiaomi already copied dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so youre really going to use your phone for years or people just love numbers my phon more well yes with that only need to upgrade phone every years because year security updates
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dollars because of apples ecosystem they have year software updates which makes more so youre really going to use your phone for years or people just love numbers my phone is remaining months to clock years old and im already tired of it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,youre the first person who understands value hats off cool se too you have sultra and sony always had highend phones which every or years time sell and purchase
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,price is to expensive for new apple iphone you can get android with same price pcs more tf are you going to do with phones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,move on man just use dongles youre paying dollars for phone want the charger in the box headphone jack expandable storage and fingerprint reader
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,on android you can install adguard which kills trackers and ads while browsing more icloud private relay vpn email support safari extension content blockers apps app do not track sign in as apple mask your email and login details if you so desire keychain access password passkeys new in ios itemised security and privacy settings contacts bluetotth usage microphone usage camera warning location tracking photo all those are security and anonymity features which is aimed at prevent spying why in your brain when you think ad blocking not getting spied news for you if you still login to your account you are already getting spied upon you should be considering vpn email masking anonymity login no tracking etc etc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,also not to mention that atrocious notch and no mm headphone jack pure shame move on man just use dongles
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ah yes freedom to be spied on freedom to send all of your data to advertisers while slowing more on android you can install adguard which kills trackers and ads while browsing moreover you can get this feature also for apps with an additional paid subscription my browsing experience is has no spyware no instability no slowing down and this is just an example of the tons of useful apps you can install on your android phone can you install such an app on your iphone or does the app store the one and only source for apps on ios not contain such apps because your data is safe enough in apples hands not that third party hackers couldnt steal your data too there are frequently news about security leaks that have to be closed by ios updates and let us not forget pegasus software from israel
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,next generation back full camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,spied dude nobody knows you nobody cares about you to spy you people do not need to care about you to make money out of infringing your privacy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,today is the preorder day here in the philippines yay cant wait to demo it out on random phone stores in malls when its released
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,and face id also only works when theres light good luck unlocking your phone in the dar more and besides android has had face unlock for over decade and nobody is using it because fingerprints are far superior nobody is using it because its not secure enough to use so for example you cant use google pay with it in other hand with face id you can use apple pay because its not just front camera which you use to scan your face like with those android face unlocks so yes theres reason why noone is using it also it doesnt work in dark face id doesnt care what the lighting is it works perfectly even in pitch black just like your tv remote because it uses same tech
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cost is the biggest issue for me you pay dollars for airpods and you pay dollars for more you still have option get the lightning to jack adapter then connect your dirty buds
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have tried ton of bluetooth headphones and none came close to cabled sound the only solut more cost is the biggest issue for me you pay dollars for airpods and you pay dollars for superior wired contemporary
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,horrible specs for price down right embarrassing with the exception of the camera and proce more also not to mention that atrocious notch and no mm headphone jack pure shame
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its pretty telling when android users who come to an apple phone topic all of them want an more well actually samsung the or note series anyways cost more than iphone but ive been diehard samsung fan my whole life but im actually going to be trying out the iphone pro max this year im getting sick of the same ole same ole they say dont knock it till you try it so im tryin it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if you will never buy it why bother ever even reading about it everyone seems to copy this more hahahha agree
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,actually iphone pro and pro max has led flashlights which is adaptiveall of them do not light up when taken picturesit depends on whether when you are taken far or near night shots
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,uro and that hot notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the funny part is that the fingerprint scanner isnt no where near as safe as face idits als more and face id also only works when theres light good luck unlocking your phone in the dark iphone users unlock their phone with the password of the time because theyre lazy to show their face or are somewhere dark and besides android has had face unlock for over decade and nobody is using it because fingerprints are far superior
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,know this is random point but why do the iphones still not support reverse wireless chargi more how else will they be able to sell future models without limiting features from the current generation they dont do it because money maybe with the iphone pro max we will see that feature the pro max is probably going to finally have usbc and that will be the main selling point for the pro max and you know what apple will sell millions reguardless because they have built their brand in way that it will pretty much sell no matter what this sounds like im just bashing on apple but honestly they are smart far smarter than me the past years ive actually slowly become an apple fan im still on android and will probably stay on android for little bit longer but cant deny that apple devices are appealing to me lately im kinda sick of spec wars on android phones it always feels like youre missing something on android android brands always have feature you want on one hand but then you lose other features if you switch over on apple at least you can just buy whatever you can afford and it has everything it also sucks that android phones depreciate in value so quickly when you can still easily sell your iphone pro max for year later while even samsung phones drop to almost half value after one year it just leaves bad aftertaste but its not like apple phones are without problems either every phone looks the same to the point that you cant even tell what phone someone has without closely inspecting the device tldr love android because all brands are different also hate android because all brands are different love apple because everything is the same so switching devices feels no different and you dont have to relearn anything hate apple because everything is the same and none of it feels unique or customizable
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,let him be if he has no proof that dont believe him yeah was sarcastic not once was mentioned that corning is producing ceramic shield here lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the ceramic shield is also produced by corning where is your proof for that claim
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,really didnt know that let him be if he has no proof that dont believe him
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,usd phone without fingerprint scanner face id is already secure enough you wont need fingerprint scanner
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,another iphone that will not buy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,and still no fingerprint scanner of course apple fans are gonna defend it because they more the funny part is that the fingerprint scanner isnt no where near as safe as face idits also far slower

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ordered the iphone pro max yesterday the first apple product have ever gotten dont care for apple as company have owned several samsung notes and my last one was note like having the stylus and use it allt the time when texting but seems samsung no longer tries to compete on price and value and their phones are what in my opinion is crippled just like apple anymore such as no memory card slot or headphone jack not to mention replaceable battery and then would be interested in fold but the quality issues it seems it is having and reading of samsung not wanting to fix them along with ridiculous price on it cut that out am having trouble connecting my note to my vehicle all the time and it seems like it is common complaint with android on some models of phones so switched to apple not happy about it but hope there are fewer issues than with samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,interesting how many android users who supposedly dont like iphones are in this comment secti more lolol feel offended by your honest and accurate statement

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,give the iphone pro since getting the pro max and since you want the pro want your current phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well the iphone is really an amazing phone love the way they worked on the camerathoug more give the iphone pro since getting the pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,only great thing about iphone is sure yrs can use the phone well maintained software more spot on
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,youll come back ive tried to leave many times over the years and always go back more in your opinion
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple have never had expandable storage theres not been headphone jack on lot of fl more stop being lan
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if it were would support this comment now though things have changed my guy lots more no need to be patronising boi
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,never really saw what was so special about huawei brand was always just so middle of the more huawei was class and provided real competition
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dont worry about me either ive just ordered pro max with tb and not becaus more hope youll treat your new iphone better and enjoy the pure smooth experience even in hz display those who are jealous to you are just fools who think they are cool with their cheap midrange phone with gb of ram and to mp oil painting camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so now its dont buy phones from ebay it doesnt matter where yo more feel sorry for you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hate this phone wtf is this island cant you just make full clear screen with mm top more you mean like sony xperia iv nobody cares about old
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nobody focuses on ebay whats that supposed to mean buyers have opinions more where is the ebay sellers buy them from
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not to mention that apple uses its own glass they dont need gorilla glass and that they more the ceramic shield is also produced by corning
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nobody focuses on ebay anymore man nobody focuses on ebay whats that supposed to mean buyers have opinions only fool would buy device directly from manufacturer when they can purchase the exact same device with the same warranty elsewhere for to less with the prices of topshelf smartphones today why waste hundreds of dollars buying from manufacturer to be certain most buyers dont purchase directly from apple or samsung they buy from the carriers the devices offered on ebay and amazon are mostly carrier smartphones if you want to throw away your money thats on you the only reason not to buy on ebay or amazon is you cant buy devices in installment payments money is only problem when you dont have any
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone is stuck its needs to be upgraded no wifi no usb no recording no hd more why are you complaining about highly bet you dont even have an device to utilise the recordings on your phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the official prices came to my country in europe iphone pro max gb iphone pro gb iphone plus gb not available yet iphone gb this is just shame
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is literally not heavy at all its heavy for someone like me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no mm jack no expansion memory card no buy no thanks bye says time traveller from
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,youre dead wrong do you sell iphones httpswwwebaycomp nobody focuses on ebay anymore man
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone and iphone pro series all have iphone hardware resources with little modification suggest wait for iphone and hopefully you get type charging port as well
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,think yeah that is better because if you buy your next phone after the iphone you will more so youre suggesting to wait for iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,oh apple did it again love your articles they are educative but did you know beretta is offering sales discount on their products
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,to be frank the iphone pro max is almost identical to the iphone pro max it makes more all of what youve mentioned happens every year except that this year apple has introduced aod and dynamic island nothing revolutionary or mind blowing in any way
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this ones heavy lad eh
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,um the pro max gb is around not no it is for the us market maybe its where youre from
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nah its eur in my country since the euro has fallen against the dollar and then the more provided price in us before taxes the point is that ultra does not cost its before tax
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,false ultra gb is with discount at bestbuy so its original price is more nah its eur in my country since the euro has fallen against the dollar and then the vat tax on top of it it means its at least more expensive in the eu but the mobile contracting makes it still kinda buyable but barely
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no doubt its topshelf device but it has number of features few will miss on lesser more false ultra gb is with discount at bestbuy so its original price is even iphone pro max gb is looks you are paid by samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dont you think its worth to be patient and wait for the next iphone since it more think yeah that is better because if you buy your next phone after the iphone you will have typec cable
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its such shame too heard the pro was an amazing phone my dad had the and more never really saw what was so special about huawei brand was always just so middle of the road too me not the best not the worsted bashed kirin chips think because too heavily focused on having many cores huawei build quality was poor screens break too easily although huawei smartphone was fairly smooth software it was still kinda slow remember they where really popular in making smartphones nearly all my family liked them seem too really like there performance and battery life they had the huawei smart for bargain price of pound theres no denying that it was good for that price huawei rip now without google play services and google play store
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you know antu score fake not basic on over throttling how do know if chip overclock or mark more how is geekbench reliable while antutu is not it depends on which system geekbench favors the iphone antutu is accurate imo
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,used to have the pro but too expensive at its time though its the last huawei phone with more its such shame too heard the pro was an amazing phone my dad had the and liked that had the mate pro at the time liked to think of them as the iphones of android incredibly well built brilliant cameras great performance without any performance drops even though people bashed the kirin chips and really nice feature sets yours came with the electromagnetic speaker under screen but it also could be used as speaker unlike the pro which was just for calls plus yours had better call quality with it too
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yeah gb could be enough for video storage even without the cloud good point this devi more tbh yeah im casual user so dont really need anything more than decent pk recording where as for yourself who does use im guessing you possibly need it for work or more of hobbiest editing with it probably is nice extra thing to have and lets be honest iphones have some of the best video recording on phone unless you get the sony ipro with all the accessories think for most of us the headphone jack and sd card slot arent really needed anymore with good quality bt headphones and cloud but again for professionalstarting up in content creating who probably needs gigabytes terabytes of storage on the fly having device that just works in all conditions has tonnes of space for raw editing and good microphones and high sample rates is lot easier to do your job than needing multiple lenses cameras and other accessories carrying around with you plus more expensive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,huawei arent partnered with leica anymore just xiaomi do agree though used to have more used to have the pro but too expensive at its time though its the last huawei phone with google service if they get emui update for that phone google service would have obliterate and no longer work properly
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,sure id get huawei but its hard to find in offline stores most of them are oppo vivo more huawei arent partnered with leica anymore just xiaomi do agree though used to have pro an early device with one of the bestlargest main sensors still mp periscope telephoto with ois and pdaf plus selfie cam with af seems to only now becoming feature in top end flagships and biometric sensor that also handles depth plus you can use gestures with it too while browsing web pages etc its shame it was so hard to keep using it without google services most games and apps wouldnt work unless using the web browser version like youtube and if you update the device once you cant install google services ever again and theres no way to roll back the update
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,did blind camera test too get rid of bias about year or again looking at multip more sure id get huawei but its hard to find in offline stores most of them are oppo vivo xiaomi realme and samsung in my region huawei cameras are so good with leica
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,however some of them still defend that ultra because of mp numbers did blind camera test too get rid of bias about year or again looking at multiple different pictures then add up scores in the end too me ever choice was pretty hard too pick favourite picture as all are so evenly matched generally try too pick the sharpest most clear picture with most clear details and refined pictures remember had doubts higher mp making big difference there was samsung iphone huawei and google pixel remember samsung won by far that had mp camera and my least favourite was the huawei iphone still second google pixel third based of scores
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bionic vs bionic vs bionic cpu test iphone pro bionic more that bionic gpu still beats the ultras adreno xclipse sounds insane for phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,in last years apple became joke when you compare with other chinese companies apple good phone better than yours
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so what changed for someone like me who uses iphones for filmmakingvideography dont more agree if youre mainly filmography enthusiast its not huge jump from the pm except for the new action mode larger camera sensorwhich might have slight effect on dof and lowlight videography and higher quality cinematic mode like you mentioned
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why leave ios then already answered it in the earlier comment go read that thanks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gorgeous phone never going to use it though dont regret leaving ios behind and will more why leave ios then
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nowhere near pro device xperia iv is more pro than this all the more you really dont need expandable storage anymore when you can get terabytes of storage via cloud you can get atleast gb free these days my find has gb built in with another gb and ive got thousands of pictures and tonnes of video from concerts recently went too and barely used any storage yeah headphone jack was annoying to lose thanks apple but you can get jack dongles most android companies offer them in the box still that work fine unless you have pixel phone my last phone the pixel pro wouldnt accept my headphones through physical connection thats terrible phone recording on phone is pointless aswell why would you buy phone with fixed lenses and not enough soc cooling vs dedicated cameralens with the proper hardware to record mean if youre proper professional film maker and not some instagram influencer throwing up second tiktok videos on the side youre going to choose dedicated hardware for the job otherwise linustechtips would just use samsung phones to record their videos instead of kk cameras samsung just love pushing the gimmick to people who have pp phones and at best tvs with their video recording cropped raw recorded video would get beaten by recording with ai and computational video using phone to record any day of the week
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the fact that its completely new sensor dunno what changed new chip that handles cinematic mode at higher resolution
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,httpsyoutubewfhqpvvpaw maybe you should see this video no need to hear anything you ca more however some of them still defend that ultra because of mp numbers
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no one asked you to tell us what is this section called again oh right post your opinion stretch your blurry eyes out and read it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,welp time to sit back relax and watch the phone nerds fight to their death out here again
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,can assure you that sony phones are anything but cheap sony is not cheap xperia iv in us gb costs the same as iphone pro max tb
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have read some reports from china camera results are not any better than pro so much more httpsyoutubewfhqpvvpaw maybe you should see this video no need to hear anything you can just use your own eyes and ears pro max just crushed ultra in camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,when got my xs max gb the retail price was eur got it via my phone operator with eur downpayment and years of contract if want the pro max tb the retail price is eur this dish is becoming to spicy for my taste even with deals from my phone operator
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,see no point whatsoever in folding phone im upgrading to iphone pro max tb and more who cares
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dynamic island or no dynamic island like it or not that notch is still going its going and mi already follow the trend
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no point to talk with these people the difference between pro max and pro max is the sa more exactly thank you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,costs in my country lmao north korea
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,think to be honest apple is the best choice for the professional person as it has better software support although find the android platform more flexible if little consistent the pixel binning mode on the iphone pro seems to be fairly conventional the manual raw mode of retaining megapixel images seems quite unusual for smartphone even though these are below type sensors in terms of size it should be better than without any interpolation bigger images and higher resolutions arent really practical at these sizes me personally would never purchase an iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,maybe steve jobs kick tim cook if hes alive to to to like buy same tshirt
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,they downgrade the battery by mah from its predecessor
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,every year apple is good at convincing their loyal customersapple devotees that how to be happy without any new updates
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple is really stubborn until the very end of lightening cable cycle because they make lot of money out of that no usbc on new iphone no buy for me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,how about the iphone pro thats quite similar there are no tangents there you see no two circles are touching each otherjust accept they copied okay
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lol noooo su just sucks miles behind from iphone at least it has sim slot until the probably removes it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is too much heavy as you seen battery is just mah your must have weakass arms if you find heavy even with mah itll still last way longer than any android phone out there stop acting like having larger capacities will always mean better battery life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,beast phone but the wallet cant take it anymore new iphone every way im fine with my almost new iphone pro max and iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,despite ground shaking advert and promotion im still getting the best out of galaxy more yeah about that no it doesnt maybe in display part but in others absolutely not
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why iphone battery is always problem theres no progress in battery iphone pro max has the battery life than any smartphone my friend but wait for the pro max iphone has better battery than any smartphone in this moment dont say that do you really use an iphone the last one in this moment dont think you know what youre talking about

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,may apple not rollout this device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,my previous phone galaxy from hast thinner black display edge than iphone display looks so cheap on iphones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nothing extra seen just mp camera forgot the screen and new chip
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it has been said that apple is rip off company and their tech is always years late in comp more truth be told that article is kinda patheticly written with click baity title since the hole punch display idea has been stolen by every other android maker from other android makers and all other stuff mentioned in the article basically every idea was stolen from lg but its ironic since being the first doesnt matter if you suck hence why there is no more lg
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why not mentioned battery capacity mah according to apple website
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just lower notch better cameras new proccesor and more expensive worthless
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so no sim slottray as follows as no charger no earpod no information about battery capacity upgrade to iphone or iphone comes out with recording and usb world wide hopefully by then

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,httpstwittercomuniverseicestatusstgvjyegsuzvnxhzdq more ios user but dont believe in geekbench being cross platform
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ladies and gentlemen had to intervene apple is never going to give you the girl friend experience you are looking for otherwise how can they sell the next generation iphones right theres and there will be always something missing which will be available next time besides still can not believe you mentioned fingerprint scanner etc go to immigration and see an officer if you want fingerprint scanner please iphones are unlocking with face masks on and yet you are taking about fingerprint scannersits not even funny at all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if apple can produce phone with notification led and thermal imaging camera will not hesitate to buy it they only focus on producing phones for social people and forget about technically inclined people money rules this world
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no wifi no usb no mmwave outside usa
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,money isnt available
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,same old apple brand makes new iphonepush some outdated and perfect little improvement and more love iphone for everything but the battery is bad
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,please bring this basic sensor to all things then ur sales be high thank you more no my friend is iphone guy and says wish it had fingerprint too
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,quite excited about apples new release notable new features being sos satellite communications dynamic island ill be upgrading when feasible im in love with the new aesthetic
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,laughed when they rumoured for this device now its back to which think is classy than the which is noisy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no info on battery cap
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,in recent years manufacturers hardly show any differences between the phones of the current more actually the fact is not like that the phone sales rather kind stable at the first time sales some people upgrade their phone from the one series below which some store offers payback for that phone or some people upgrades from their contract with operator maybe some people are not tend to upgrade their phone but the truth is the first sales always full of people who want to buy the latest series even we called it expensive and only
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,honestly just compared the pm with pm and literally there are no changes just except for minor ones and these guys literally charging and above seriously the same with samsung these manufacturers should release flagships once in or years now we have reached the peak of changes and imo we see new upgrades barely in or years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,that wallpaper looks like sony xperia iv wallpaper generally mark four series but speci more or iphone wallpaper
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,can make ens nft for iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,any idea about battery the iphone pro max reached hr screen on time with mah so its obvious that pro or pro max will get to hr screen time think so could be wrong
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,very disappointedwhy apple did not make two dynamic islands
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,there are alot of china smartphone companies that apple is feared of apple does not target low income customers they are not threatened by small manufacturers because that is not their target
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,httpstwittercomuniverseicestatusstgvjyegsuzvnxhzdq benchmark scores for insane multicore
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still usb pathetic
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so so dissapohnting to see no usbc connection on the new phones makes me want to leave apple iphones and move on to something else so dissapointed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,big up apple company coz this phone is really nyc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this so called apple bionic is only on par with mediatek mt lenovo is better than more agree but bionic can definitely defeat mt in isp and ai
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,really doubt that as it have shown they dont eat iphone sales they eat samsung sales more phones are boring now handheld pc are the new highly sought technology aya neo and steamdeck is the hottest gadget now
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple is losing its market and samsung is taking over the market in what sammy dreamwor more there are alot of china smartphone companies that apple is feared of
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hours ago httpswwwsammobilecomnewssamsungwarnsofdecliningmemorychipsalesext more they are making new chips hahahahaha
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,agree even if apple will just make another iphone and rename it iphone they will still more why would people stop buying iphones you make it look like everyone currently have iphone even if iphone would be pretty much same than tens of millions would buy it because it offers lot of new iphone users who have years old iphone and theres like million of them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not enough improvement innovation practically none starts at here looks identical to the pro max except no notch the front cam is finally under the screen with some cool alert animations on the display on top of them but theyve shaped them and named it the dynamic island marketing bionic blazing fast but for powering what pixel binning may happen about second faster very bright display but youll never go full bright even in direct sunlight its like samsung but nits the ultra is nits too much the camera mp the exact same thing as every android camera pixel binning so mp but slightly better quality no video but better stabilization
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple about to make trillions with this phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,same as iphone pro outcluding notch and mp
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,for godsake please stop vining and crying about new iphones specifically you guys whos go more agree even if apple will just make another iphone and rename it iphone they will still make trillions because people will not stop buying apple phones for dignity
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,majority of them are not and its fact not fact its only your opinion but believe whatever you want
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,same device same sheitttt just little ram and camera upgrades apple dont have proper desi more hours ago httpswwwsammobilecomnewssamsungwarnsofdecliningmemorychipsalesextendinginto samsung warns of declining memory chip sales extending into the whole smartphone industry except apple is in downfall
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the galaxy ultra is waaaaay cheaper than the iphone pro max heck the iphone pro more anything made by samsung that is sucks and imo that last great iphone was the
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple cant stop winning there is almost no difference between this and the pro max so dont know what iphone keeps winning
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no because gb of ram have been the standard on most midrange phones for the last yea more bro theres an offline store in abu dhabi selling the galaxy ultra sd version gb for including sales tax as tourist we can also get vat refund on airport which will bring the price down to
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,except for dynamic island everything else is not worth upgrading at all wastage of money pro max is better deal in every way
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no because gb of ram have been the standard on most midrange phones for the last years more no because gb of ram have been the standard on most midrange phones for the last years we should expect more from the most expensive normal phone on the market in year os support been standard in all iphones for atleast years we should expect more from the most expensive normal phone on the market which by the way is samsung galaxy ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,getting one soon by gods grace
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apples systems are designed to fit their unique architecture and their own processor so more thats why most nonapple apps just get paused in the background over actually being active in the background like it does on android and can use more of the ram for that nice feature like said gb of ram doesnt come without negative sides so thats why say more ram is always better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,we are in where gb of ram should be minimum why just because you more no because gb of ram have been the standard on most midrange phones for the last years we should expect more from the most expensive normal phone on the market in
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it is an shaped hole
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple the best
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lithium ion why lithium polymer not good
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lets see how it goes
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,although dont own an iphone this is still impressive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this is and youre stuck with those stock icon no theme store for customization same old boring deign on the regular is no fast charging as compared to the rest of the competition wheres usb type
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,dynamic island should be on all models next year just hate why apple needs to name this feature dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,we are in where gb of ram should be minimum just because iphone works fine wit more we are in where gb of ram should be minimum why just because you say so ok do it too we are in where years of os updates should be minimum
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,opps
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,who you are to judge anyone or think you know them why you are so bitter iphones get better more not just bitter hate the logo phones completely tell me where is no notch display foldables huge camera improvement even in terms of great improvement of performance how do you define improvement you mean tech aod for and declaring that the best aod of smartphone unless their software optimization apple is no inventive useless cheap tech giant samme xiaomi even vivo take the risk of tech innovation and give the customers to taste the new they dare where is apple they just stole the good things from others and saying like we give you the best of weve done just keep worshipping the apple just take mirror selfie with that logo flex on social media make girl impressed chase for new tech not logos not brands
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,theres no difference between and
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,next year apple will remove lightning usb port to save the environment and will promote to use wireless charger
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im just baffled at how similar the pro model wallpaper is similar to sony mark series wallpaperapple just zoomed out sonys wallpaper edited the colours and called it daylol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,grams thats what call brick the most expensive brick in the world
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,where you need more than gb are you just comparing it blindly to what android phones have more do know that the iphone functions well with gb of ram and im not comparing with android but dude when you spend this much money on phone you might as well get more ram
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,norhing its the same phone but with higher price tag outside the us
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wireless charging is horrible haha why would anyone buy apple phones all those specs are bad not worth the price
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so one camera change and minimal design change and thats it what do we expect its classic apple pathetic no high mp ultrawide and zoom camera only zoom camera no decent fast charging year old design super dated os really dont get it why do people buy this trash
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,would you consider midrange with gb of ram would take midrange phone with gb of ram and highend phone with both and gb of ram
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,how you drive monitor with this usb you can only mirror iphone screen via macbook rather inconvenient
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,but the fold just shows why more ram actually matters not only that but its way bet more would you consider midrange with gb of ram
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,but we are not talking about foldable here we are talking about why iphone needs more than more we are in where gb of ram should be minimum just because iphone works fine with gb of ram doesnt mean gb of ram wouldnt be better the normal iphone and plus could always have had gb of ram while the iphone pro and pro max should have had gb of ram as those can do more than the iphone and plus
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the ugliest iphone yet
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thats not the case at all android phones have had lot of ram long before foldables it more but the fold just shows why more ram actually matters not only that but its way better to have to much ram over just having enough or maybe to little
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,android phones needs more ram because they can do alot more than what an iphone can do ju more thats not the case at all android phones have had lot of ram long before foldables its just the fact that android is poorly optimized and its heavy os and it has poor ram management with same functions than fold have iphone wouldnt need that much ram not even close my ipad already so those tasks with just gb so stop it already and my desktop pc many years ago did lot more with gb than you will ever to do with foldable
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,only camera updated iphone will have actual upgrade titanium body type port apple modem
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,on top of that the ram is still stuck at gb where you need more than gb are you just comparing it blindly to what android phones have they need lot more ram to function well ive used pro since launch and never had situation where phone needed more ram where you think it will matter also use ipad pro from with real multitasking and havent had any problem even with gb ram remember how back in time our desktop pc had gb and how demanding tasks we did with them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,want thirdparty apps move to android iphones arent for you also iphones do not overheat iphones do over heat what do you use classic snake games or brick games using pro max it literally go at least while playing genshin impact in fps depending on situation
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so the only difference between iphone pro max and iphone pro max is the camera update in more what is the difference between iphone and iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,kinda disapointing that they placed last year chipset on the new iphone and the normaloth more on top of that the ram is still stuck at gb
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,where is fingerprint sensor where have you been living since the iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,first super ulgy iphone xperia proi next to iphone pro looks sexy and like phone for man more lol the xperia proi looks pathetic and it is so much cheaper right quit living in dream
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,oh how cute apple has released the new old model as usual same thing with your galaxy and xiaomi no new innovations or real upgrades
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,one thing about apple is that we cant download any apps of games from third party rest more want thirdparty apps move to android iphones arent for you also iphones do not overheat
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,once again we have developed the best iphone ever the iphone world has never seen before
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,because of people like you apple can making the same indifferent phones with weak improveme more who you are to judge anyone or think you know them why you are so bitter iphones get better every year of course the difference cant be that noticable every year because the phones are already so friggin good its exact same thing with every oem why you make it like apple thing when everyone are in same situation you know theres reason why most people upgrade once in three years their phones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,megapixels has come to android phones since now smartphone can go up to megapixel more yet this camera will be better then all those mp or mp cameras those cheap phones with high megapixels their cameras are trash really
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if you cant afford just keep on dreaming about it clearly you dont know anything abt ap more because of people like you apple can making the same indifferent phones with weak improvement no technical invention and you are still chasing the logo phones not the good ones you just want to make girl impressed konw nothing about technology apple will always love the people like you since you guys make them rich
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lol what great joke both and iphone pro max are in different leagues and obviously more well if one doesnt understand anything about photography you will get good looking photos with pretty much every smartphone currently in store its the small details which makes the difference and you need to pay lot of money for those pretty much like if you buy acoustic guitar it sounds really good but if you buy over acoustic guitar it sounds even better and feels better when playing but the difference is not that noticable for regular listener or amateur guitar player
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post he says iphone has top notch secuirty lol while last year there was case that many apps have been xposed copying your clipboard after ios updatehe didnt know about it bet lol and why those who can afford are really rude to others opinion
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple hasnt really been doing any drastic improvements for while now apart from the new chip which probably of the users wont really make full use of some animation changes and minor improvement in the camera there isnt really nothing much to be hyped about would probably be more impressed if they actually increased their ram to match their processor
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its too expensive for gb ramand nowadays even cheap phones can record mp my samsung more lol what great joke both and iphone pro max are in different leagues and obviously have very different photo qualities learn more about cameras before even spouting out foolish remarks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,should upgrade my pro max hell no but apple needs to speak truth about their performance of their bionic chip the number they are putting is ridiculous with no real world facts come on theyre claiming competitor still playing catch up with bionic this is one of the biggest lie have ever heard tsmcs qualcomm snapdragon plus gen andreno gpu is already superior than bionic core gpu can provide prove it you want that tsmc made andreno is superior than bionic metal core gpu still agree with the fact that in terms of cpu performance android is still behind specially in single core performance we have already seen dimensity is par with in multi core performance
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why the chipset is not put it is big fed up for all that will be too much of an overkill
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,until they produce an apple with usbc port will stick to my noiphone policy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nobody cares you cared enough to answer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,realme pro is better than th iphone pro in battery life yeah keep smokin that pack you got if you cant afford just keep on dreaming about it clearly you dont know anything abt apple products and why people buying it more and more are leaving the android platform market particularly chinese phones android has very very poor security and of scam victims are using android particulary chinese phonesdo your own homeworkpeople upgrade iphones on average every to years keep that garbage redmi phone of yours
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,battery capacity where
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,now now now android is big league and if you check realme pro you would notice it has more if you use it for calling then yes but if you use it screen on tasks pro max have longer battery life for example gsmarene test shows hours more video play for pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,samsung bbk and xiaomi are in lot of trouble lol how are they going to get over this xiaomi and samsung already have better cameras and screens especially samsung which isnt suprsing since they basically make every high end screen for phone that exits apple included iirc they wont loose sleep over this phone its good but its not something that destroys their phones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ppi worthty of spotlight current density champs are sony xperia iv and iii with ppi more look the screens arent exactly useful on phones of course there is advantages here and there but the higher res you go harder it is to notice realistically is sweet spot between price being in line with competition and usefulness
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,strat from eur for gb its good price its literally been the same price for the past years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no it doesnt lol samsung and other brands copied their design anyway samsung copied iphone design what the your eyes okay
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple promotes satellite communication as an emergency feature so its not meant more update its free for the first years then you have to pay the subscription
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,euro and still no charger included tf
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,mp sensor is quad bayer one so nothing special android phones are using it for almost years so nothing innovative about it apple is just late here and copied others had it been mp rgb sensor then that would be interesting but smartphone oems no longer care about proper innovation only maximizing profit
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nothing much new samsung galaxy already use dynamic island still no usb type in more you fan
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,talk all you wantiphone is the best in the world believe that every celebrity own more exaggeration be like
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it looks exactly like samsung galaxy no it doesnt lol samsung and other brands copied their design anyway
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow it looks like apple iphone finally lost the game by huawei samsung has lost the game in being bad phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,camera good already now waiting batterys mah for all iphone versions hope you can update them sooner
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,was waiting for the iphone pro max but after seeing this ugly holes will buy the instead if you checked iphone pro max you would complain about the notch on the screen lol android fanboy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nothing new with iphone pro max except for the chip satellite and hole punch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nobody care but did care enough to answer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,esim only for us bummer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it literally doesnt lmao because of the small battery wrong even the iphone pro max with the small battery won all the androids in battery life except those ones with very thick batteries
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple iphone pro max apple iphone pro apple iphone plus apple iphone more youve completely forgot about the satellite feature which can be useful
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,first thing search for new phone is big battery all the features in the world are us more not always bigger battery is better samsung ultras battery got defeated by iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,what hideously large and ugly punch hole not to mention the zoom sucks and the camera sense more says an android fanboy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,depends some android software are welloptimized for battery life some are not majority of them are not and its fact
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,grs oh noheavy brick
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,recoding in iphone pro max hahaha in samsung galaxy ultra recording they still can in for recording flagship iphones well nak iphone se its still okay but in pro max its terrible
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the new dynamic island is awesome you can hate it or not but it really is its different from android world cant wait for reviews
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not radio why
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nothing that much new but at least no price hike which is good for consumer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it is king of all smartphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,euro that is so cheapi mean cheat
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,sattelite message option is this gonna be for free apple promotes satellite communication as an emergency feature so its not meant to replace regular cellular connectivity source googles featured snippets which iphone have satellite connection from here believe it is premium feature
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,top specs impressive cameras very bright screen how about batery endurance fast charge iphone doesnt have fast charge it says in minutes which is pretty slow
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,system wide font choices and icon packs and themes from new apple theme store hmmmmm
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yeah and yet itll still have better battery life than any android depends some android software are welloptimized for battery life some are not
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still lighting lmao
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the most amazing iphone since iphone the best phone out there im obsessed with new more what hideously large and ugly punch hole not to mention the zoom sucks and the camera senses tiny compared to the ultra by xiaomi
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hope that apple resolve the issue that you cant transfer photos or any files from the iphone to your pc using bluetooth or usb cable know it is very hard to implement but hope they succeed to achieve it this time in ios google worked hard and succeeded in this mission
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,shut up like following technology and whats new and whats not you and that oth more just dont
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post disagreed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why is ios still so goofy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,how sad apple you finally upgraded to mpx but still there are not video
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,reality ppl complain then buy lol get ready for samsung galaxy ultra cuz want to smash iphone pro max im fan of samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the iphone used to cost around more in sweden which is completely logical now they cost more the crazy part is that iphone cost more now than when it first came out dont understand how an old phone could cost more now than when it was brand new
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,over having hours more screen on time with way more boring or worse usage experience more httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtsvxpzlrplg the samsung galaxy fold managed to get hours and minutes in usage time screen on time there while the iphone pro max got hours and minutes so the iphone pro max doesnt really have that much more battery life compared to how boring it is to use compared to the fold
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphones might have longer battery life overall but the fun you get with fold for exam more over having hours more screen on time with way more boring or worse usage experience ultra already lost by two hours to pro max try more like hours more compared to fold
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not worth the upgrade from pro doubt cameras are that much better and the only interesting feature is the dynamic island thing more expensive than pro in europe and uses lightning still the satellite probably wont be usable in europe too and who knows what will be with crash detection here too
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple always want to differentiate there products from android
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no wife no usb no mmwave for non us countries
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no wifie again same old wifi chip with only hz very sad
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no video reording option for the iphone series is one of the disappointing part in gb wont be enoughlike in dolby vision can consume over gb for min video
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,like somebody saidgrow up whether the island is on the leftright or centerthe aesthetics more shut up like following technology and whats new and whats not you and that other person are completely no one to say to someone to grow up move on buddy if youre here to act like someone mature and telling people to grow up for liking something on tech website you dont belong here then imo
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,oh you just did not tell me to grow up first you android people are crying every single yea more like somebody saidgrow up whether the island is on the leftright or centerthe aesthetics is subjective stop sounding like broken record and grow up
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ok let me ask few questions why is dhar mann so biased toward apple and acts like andro more right questions
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if the is as good they claim might finally switch over from my trusty note love android but snapdragon chips just too hot and power hungry currently
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,really didnt think itd actually look like this not complaining though because it looks cool
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you realise that this was an android feature done poorly several years ago stop wittering abo more oh you just did not tell me to grow up first you android people are crying every single year how apple is that and is that name the model who had the exact same feature as dynamic island im waiting smart ss
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,god the screen at hbm outright surpassed the series nits peak brightness could outright turn this phone into full pledged flashlight
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,elegant design suitable with the new generation of the modern world with beautiful additions
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,they didnt talk about the battery think it still weak yeah and yet itll still have better battery life than any android
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,found my own pro max is better caz with noch it gives me feeling of iphone rather than more yeah everybody talked like this too when iphone was launched then mos of the people if not everyone are getting used of it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im simple just need mm jack please not phone with itunes
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,after years you need to get new one phone its basic marketing strategy
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,but the pro max has silly notch the iphone pro max has bezelless screen with hole punch eh if you saw the latest rumour its gonna be one huge pill notch instead of hole and small pill
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,once you experience fast charge you will eat your words in don more that is totally valid but not everyone is teenager or hippie or nearing their retiring period some people are busy university students some work hours week some have the money to go around the world with their social circle their fast busy lifestyle requires the fastest charging or else their phone will be the one bottlenecking their lifestyle of course its not gonna ruin their life but what is the purpose of technological innovation if its not for eliminating these small inconveniences
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,always the samei see only one changinghim main camera mpthe rest is always the samethingalways the same closed echosystem without compatibilities with other osapple needs to change his modus opperandi
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,sure mega pixels are one part of the quality of an image but nowadays is all ai learning and more so for you to use mp android has them fast
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,once you experience fast charge you will eat your words in once you experience fast charge you will eat your words in dont even use current fastest method available and im scared it will ruin my battery couldnt care less about faster charging have no such hurry in my life
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,but come on apple lovers are the brainwashed ones no you got it all wrong more once you experience fast charge you will eat your words in
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,mpx no record
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,when its about photo editing audio editing and mastering scene controllers etc apple more lol mate your funny no one from professionals using mac for video editing and etc amateurs yes because its very easy to use already created sheets drivers and etc you talk like still living in the all updates automatically you even forget what spec you have but hey if you love funny dog pictures use apple dont forget to set siri to remind wash your teeth
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,agree hate apple but one cant deny that because they make all their parts their le more but come on apple lovers are the brainwashed ones no you got it all wrong you only need to spend one day in apple article comment sections to understand how brainwashed android users are by big numbers on paper mean they are demanding bigger numbers that what desktop pcs had like ten years ago and those are capable of doing very demanding tasks which noone will ever do with smartphones but somehow you need to have crazy powerful phone for very light tasks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just waiting to buy one asap
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,though just how much can it do till gb ram low ram shows its ugly head it can more agree hate apple but one cant deny that because they make all their parts their less than android ram will work very well but come on apple lovers are the brainwashed ones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,was an apple loyal customer since until pro max migrated to android this past june an more was their loyal customer until was released then realised they are not trying and they werent up until now for instance they finally replaced that mp sensor did give them another chance when the first ipad mini was released which could do phone apps in retina but apple did not allow it unless oyu used teak from jailbreaking you cant just freshly switch and come talk like you had revolution
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,whats so funny in that
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the android phones are basically portable pcs that can make phone calls not much androi more when its about photo editing audio editing and mastering scene controllers etc apple beats everything theres no win pc nor android device that can do these jobs like the idevices do you wont see too much musicians using win laptop live most of them use macbooks ios ipados and macos are designed just for the apples hardware both win and android are designed to rich variety of hardware the same os having to run on so much more and totally different devices thats why android and win would always need drivers instead of apples operating systems more drivers more prone to instability and to issues in general for example ios does not need many launchers in fact it doesnt need launcher at all all app shortcuts icons are right in front of the user android app launcher is at swipe away in ios you dont have to swipe the screen to reach the app launcher widgets probably there are more widgets available for android but widgets add an extra battery consumption no matter the os and the device or dont want extra power consumption being socalled close environment apples operating systems dont have security software antivirus for example like win does security threats in android are similar to those in win and finally all apple devices communicate so well each others apps for ios have similar apps for macos and for ipados you dont need third party clouds for apple devices there is icloud and its enough for android devices theres no an android cloud instead you have to rely to google drive dropbox etc
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if its price is only dollars it is worth buying when will the preorder iphone pro max open
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,they are too clever just few tweaks in cosmetics and the internal hardwares iphone is ready already iphone is widely available in large numbers flooding the market in addition to the old lineup all the way back to iphone series yet their excuses adding charger is not good to environment these greedy rich apple should stop flooding the market with iphones which basically used for just show piece rather than real smart phone usage look any decent android lineup or even their own series quite powerful enough for today tasks with very good camera and decent battery what to say they just keep filling their pockets as long as these people change their mindset as long as these greedy apple use lightning port their excuse for environment can go and suck everest mount
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hope battery is at least mah its ok phonelike versionbut why apple dont include more check out the specifications
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,tankz android up to more ram in ios
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post noone can answer to that question except you they both offer completely different experience so its just matter of taste if you like android or ios more hardware wise pro max will be ahead
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,do hope ios can do all this stuff and much more and not too locked down but this does more though just how much can it do till gb ram low ram shows its ugly head it can do everything you throw to it and it wont show its ugly head ever my ipad pro from have gb ram and it have never shown its ugly head mean seriously what you think my old desktop pc had gb ram and did so much more demanding tasks with that than ever will do or even can with smartphone was running full photoshop and music producing software sametime without any problem this just shows how well the brainwash works when people have completely lost the reality
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,your comment is quite silly its unable too meet all your needs making you need more the android phones are basically portable pcs that can make phone calls not much android phone cant do android got many launchers download managers many good browsers android gadgets feature rich user interface many app stores android already has more market share in gaming then windows android also has video editing and recorders its hard to think of something pc can do phone cant unless youre into gaming and youre games are only on windows and if all thats not enough flagship phone can emulate windows and run windows virtual machine inside of it there are external keywords and mouse and adopters too get them to work and ways too connect phone too monitor at above pound if phone cant do this it is not good enough for the asking price
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thats kinda the point am making the iphone is handlecap locked down device it more its name as phone not pc or laptop what is your problem want to use like pc buy apple mac thats all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphone ok if all you want to do is take pictures videos social media watch videos browse more thats kinda the point am making the iphone is handlecap locked down device its unable too meet all your needs making you need pc too get work done the iphone basically console and is very limited and restricted and although its got good soc its not made for gaming multi tasking or power users all of the tasks the iphone is good for shouldnt cost this much money out the customers pockets apple really is in the wrong market theres are expectations and tasks for budget phones note high ram needed gb ram on android for smooth experience if all only want is taking pictures etc its hard too justify the high cost and asking price unfortunately apple doesnt make budget phones with good software support and old iphone opinions like iphone iphone or iphone se are basically end of support or about to be witch wanted too say are good but cant
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just saw leaked video of pro series apparently youll be able to choose whether you want pillhole shape or just pill shape on display

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ugly hole on the screen pass id rather buy ip pro max then buy the pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,pro max is very solid flagship to consider but ill be waiting on pro max with more apple more likely too remove the changing port all together then go type epic games also tryed too make apple less bad but lost in the usa and failed the eu do hope gets domanding of apple too stop all the bs and make there repairable and gives people control over there own devices software when buy device it belongs too you not apple this something apple doesnt understand apple is bad influence on the smartphone market and is the reason for most of the problems of today smartphones market shame on android phone manufacturers for being copy cats and following apple in there foot steps
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nokia owns the alcatel brand so the alcatel phones will be here for long time my point more bunch of nonsense please spare me from your replies from now on
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nah youre just trolling at this point alcatel is long dead company dont kno more nokia owns the alcatel brand so the alcatel phones will be here for long time my point is though iphone missing lot of luxury android has and is overpriced and apples device are just all lemons they handlecap capped by ios apple generally prefer the alcatel over anything apple makes at least it runs android can use the alcatel as my smartphone even if had iphone my only use for it is too sell it for the money for more usable phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,but its designed better its got features apple should copy alcatel phone the more nah youre just trolling at this point alcatel is long dead company dont know why you brought them from grave from first moment
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,those are totally not comparable alcatel looks like trash bin beside an iphone lol but its designed better its got features apple should copy alcatel phone the ideal design with better screen
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,almost hits and the phone hasnt launched yet wow
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is this design confirmed tried to look on other sources it is still rumor no this is not iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,think iphones new design is not good enough didnt like display it could be better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,how much time does it take to charge
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,guys stop complaining about the ram gb ram is enough but only for apple phones cause the more iphone only has gb of ram and no genshin impact wasnt playable the game will crash all the time whenever you exit from waypoint due to lack of ram to upload the graphic on time plus has gb and the performance was staggering at best and often laggy out of all devices only huawei mate series can still play genshin impact at max graphic without any stutter or lag iphone plus is the minimum device to go if you want to enjoy the full experience on genshin impact with lowest budget possible
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so the mp camera is only panoramic camera the other two remain mp
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,idk think he have lot of money and want to make expensive apps even though there is cheap option because ios user know that they are poor but showing that there have better thing but androids have even more thing and it also do it betterly because apple thinks ios is better in everything but in reality its not if they do ios vs android in most of the cases android will win because apple dont want there users to have fun and please dont show hate towards ios or apple am just telling could wrong but afterall even if you use ios you are gonna have good experience
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,overpriced
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yawn exactly what was thinking
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yawn
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you are tired because you cant get things free overpriced mobile games are super che more also mobile games are super cheap just tell me you didnt see diablo immortal without telling me you didnt see diablo immortal not all mobile games are super cheap because there are gacha games that can be either expensive or just borderline scam just for cosmetics and powerups
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thats just sad you are stealing other people work and paycheck and even advertise it more then im gonna do it again im tired of seeing raid shadow legends sponsor while was trying to watch video this is why youtube vanced got banned if you want to defend ads to support the devs try defending not safe for work ads being put on youtube
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hopefully finally next year apple will update the ram amount iphone pro max better be more what difference it makes why you care this ram so much not once have had situation with this pro where gb isnt enough heck my ipad pro have gb and it has splitscreen multitasking and even with that havent had situation where gb isnt enough mean we are talking very light apps here and its not like you can run apps open same time on the screen which could need ram
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im tired of overpriced pw games spotify youtube subcriptions plans etcits draining my more you are tired because you cant get things free overpriced mobile games are super cheap they can be because so many buy them spotify offers free tier and even if you pay you get all the music in world with very cheap price cmon telegram also have premium version dont think their free version will get price tag
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,im sticking to android to download free paid android games whatsapp telegram mods youtube fr more thats just sad you are stealing other people work and paycheck and even advertise it wonder what you like when you are old enough to go work and someone just steals part of your paycheck no wonder ios users get all the good stuff because we actually want to reward developers for their work so they want to keep making stuff for us unlike for android
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its kinda ugly ngl
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow the punch holes look like letter how cute for iphone lol
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ill never understand to this revolutionsupposed
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,remind that samsungapple design is fatality trend similiar to simpsonfamily guy artstyle scenario
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lmao they left lightning charge they should have kept fooling them selves with that slow stuff they should change to type
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,finally apple is improving the camera from mp to mp thats still just rumors apple has not yet confirmed it just wait on th for the reveal
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,my experience was with gb ram on android gb ram on android is bare minimum needed for an more have noticed this with iphone also the device no matter how low end is still smooth in there os they will probably remain smooth forever the iphone no matter how new or old all run similar the catch with apple devices is the ram amount needed for future apps and app support and pricing and battery life noticed budget iphone buyers have it really rough the battery life in iphones is awful games saying no longer supported without workaround gb ram was never good amount and has not aged well either and gaming will suffer the iphone se now because budget phone but the software support is problem this is why think iphone se lite ideal phone would be good pound budget phone but with long software support lets say promise years and smooth apple needs too extended there software support for older iphone that are affordable like iphone se with the choice too stay on same ios version or update or just make apps backwards compatible or have ever app have legacy versions for older ios versions
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,you should not spending much on low end phones save more money on better midranger or maybe more android sluggish up too gb ram even androidgo needs at least gb ram gb ram amount will probably be ok till you install few too many apps for midrange recommend good processor and at least gb ram for flagship maximum amount of ram you can get gb ram maximum performance processor and cooling and storage speed just maximum hardware specs is the best dont buy budget phones over midrange just dont have that kinda money got very low income and tight budget all can afford is around pound possible save up for long time for pound phone have too look for bargains the reason have few budget phones is because over the years brought new phones but my old phones are still working and even my first ever smartphone still is working buy phones with not only upfront cost in mind but the cost in the long run also so do favour features like removable batterys and high endurance rating storage and the os staying functional forever if possible
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the problem with android is the system itself lets apps to run in background so it almost eat more thatll is was what happened was asked too test performance of gaming phone nubia red magic gb ram so tested many games and apps for in fps stability see if phone overheats the browser runs smoothly ram was the main bottleneck on the phone when you fill storage with games on gaming phone this is definitely very android problem that is serious problems for gamers who play many different games the big game liberty had ram usage maxed out too the point apps started force closing themselves this is why just say gb ram minimum on android otherwise you cant really use your storage for apps if youre buying gaming phone you may as well buy the gb ram modal also smoothness problems happens when ram gets overloaded too easy from many browser tabs or dual screen mode just too easily done on android yes do advice getting flagship chipset paired with the ram
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is this pill and hole punch selfie camera layout confirmed or is it just rumour its real except they keep the notch for vanilla
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,am still here having talk sense its your job too keep apple in check your the ones more my experience was with gb ram on android gb ram on android is bare minimum needed for android running smoothly has very bad ram management system was struggle with gb ram with gaming multi tasking etc exactly android im using ipad pro from and think this has gb and it still runs great without any problem its actually really hard to believe this is years old device
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the phone carrying around with me is gb ram androidgo phone dont own any phone more you should not spending much on low end phones save more money on better midranger or maybe flagships dont focus on ram size too much to gb is enough for midrange to is enough for flagships just focus on chipset first then storage and ram config
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why we need to complain about ram because you have used android phone with gb ram and it more am still here having talk sense its your job too keep apple in check your the ones buying them apple should just lower there pricing if unwilling too higher there amount of ram too just gb ram iphone has less ram then ps console from and is more expensive today my experience was with gb ram on android gb ram on android is bare minimum needed for android running smoothly has very bad ram management system was struggle with gb ram with gaming multi tasking etc for flagship android phone gb ram is good amount but android would benefit from gb ram lot if any manufacturer was too make android phone with this ram amount
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,usb speed lighning again on device that can store up to tb of pro res video good luck downloading that was going to get pro max if they had upped the speed to at least usb but its useless without for me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ignore him anyway he only buys phones for ram size im trying to understand these brainwashed droids but its really difficult
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,agree try to make your android even the flagship one with airplane mode battery will dra more they put so much effort designing the chipset in terms of efficiency
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphones arent androids why would you want more ram than gb the os ram management is diff more agree try to make your android even the flagship one with airplane mode battery will drain less than hrs do on ios week still at it shown how effective the ios is
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,never even bought flagship android all the androids you bought are crappy ones and more so your flagship android you bought how long did it last until you changed to the new one totally agree on years iphone usage its real
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the apple fans need too make complaints about gb ram and pricing apple cheapest phones are more why we need to complain about ram because you have used android phone with gb ram and it worked really badly cant figure any other reason as ive havent had even one situation where gb ram been issue with this pro apple cheapest phones are less bad but there flagship are awful coming from brainwashed android boy who have never owned one right do you seriously think apple would sell that many iphones if its awful and have customer satisfaction
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,some people buy iphones because of its reliability and premium customer support and aftersales more am using android phones since never had any problem with them everyone looks on software support never felt any change when updating my phone on newer android version and when kept the old version for long time never had any problem and what sort of reliability ios always has bugs and security problems recently they found again another security leak and it had to be repaired by an update even if there was some sort of real advantage with having an iphone people actually just buy it to show off and tell their friends that they also love to debit their bank account to the extreme it is always ghetto people who walk around with those toylike phones with glitter colour and bitten apple on the back
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,my first smartphone was samsung galaxy back when was in middle school used it for quite more never even bought flagship android all the androids you bought are crappy ones and then you conclude that iphone are better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple is slowly increasing their phones features but better than ever saw on other phones
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this exactly usually kids buy android because they want to tweak everything when they get ol more here are the words of an apple fan boy always on the android side forever
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,it doesnt look like it more like ip pro ip has smaller cam bump compared to pro and more the design originated from iphone so iphone design is same as but is bigger as you said
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yeah was expecting at least gb ram since the iphone pro has gb ram according to rumours it will be faster lpdr ram so it will be more power efficient and faster ram than pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why did apple put it in the middle shouldve put on the side
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,many read your comments still dont understand your point and summary of those his comments are just storytelling who in the right mind comparing iphones to android just because of the ram its like comparing apples to watermelons
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,have both iphone pro max and ultra most of my frequently used apps are in samsung more except for long term reliability and good resale value
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,what you paid to apple is their premium user experience like the operating system their hard more have used iphones as family and friends have them but it is true didnt buy iphone for myself the modal wanted too buy want out of software support before was able too buy it the iphone take so long too get to ok price the premium user experience iphone is said too have just seens like awkward gestures control too me was never able too understand navigation on iphone only liked the home bottom like android has my mums iphone got long time ago about the operating system the os support is awful apps said no longer supported was why my mum hates apple now because really light game she can no longer play and everything just stops working really fast the phone dont turn on anymore my friends iphone stops working for lot what she needed too software and apps not supported not enough storage and poor battery life this kinda stuff just dont happen on android even very old versions of android still work as far back as android with most games and apps and there is sd card slot and removable battery on some android phones the hardware iphone well there so unreliable one both broke one dead from battery stopped working other cant remember also there gb ram is not premium amount of ram camera was fine at least also there was fear if put in your pocket with phone it would bend and break the phone we had lot of smartphones in are house family had many but drop them often budget samsungs huawei alcatel many generic phones some flagships from sony the older budget android phones used be real crap was very slow and freeze up all the time old samsung alcatel was seen as rubbish huawei was very popular was never fan of there phones or software dad like sony the sony phones didnt like sony much my mum got my dads old sony phone but after the sony phone all beaten up still going with its back half off and broken dead battery it dead but it come back from the dead same battery lol and can use battery down too the very last it owned my respect the other thing about old sony phone is it was not slow like budget android phones iphone has always been smooth but it not changed one can pick up old or new iphone same thing same case with generic phones but there just slow but dont get slower have never used vivo or oppo know highest amount of ram on android phone is on gaming phones from lenovo nubia or asu unless you build android pc or are able too give android emulator more ram have no idea of the max amount of ram android can be given and support but hope it is crazy high todays budget android phones do feel so different too the past the umdigi pro it is beast for its price the gb ram makes the phone so nice too use and unlike the others it can game regardless of tact it not cost much or older gaming phone best phone have ever used old grampa wanted something fast xd had set it up and test it for him and wow it feels so premium the nubia red magic phone the just using the screen and how fast and hyper sensitive and responsive the screen is you can feel the power though using the screen and it dont slow down or overheat only problem find was gb ram was too easy too max out usage then apps close themselves so wish it had hell of lot more ram think iphone should just match the ps from at least in ram gb ram and fix there software older ios versions dont age well
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,please bring back the keypad and the infrared kindly consider also to input television on ip just like the one on china phones very modern concept can watch my favorite series on my phone without buying netflix account
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bring back the notch if they bring back the notch many people would complain about the notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,congratulations to apple for finally making new design since they finally made it to more lol have you seen the photos that under display camera makes apple at least does not tend to release beta products to an actual customers ahem fold ahem
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post what you paid to apple is their premium user experience like the operating system their hardware is very high quality compared to android which runs like midrange samsung after years of usage if you still think about apple is ripping off customers well you never had own an iphone nor rarely use one budget android phones cant be compared to iphones they are on different class why would people still complain about ram size nowadays just dont leave tabs on majority of people like old people buys vivo and oppo because of its absurd amount of ram size but they still get the same performance as previous one they own ios ram management is different to androids so it still runs smooth even in near future with gb ram just take an example of iphone plus gb ram still runs like new even in years let alone older iphones below series they no longer support updates like ios anyway but still runs fine like nothing happened
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cant buy iphone but really like to check specs same to same
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,willing to honestly go on back to apple ive had apple since my first phone recently got the and honestly would take my xr back other than the camera this phone just doesnt cut it battery life and just the little glitches here and there of opening an app to fast and the phone just has seizure and shuts the app down my xr after years of use was running better than this phone year in also had the at one point and whole phone screen just shut down months in apple may not be as interestingcool but definitely whole lot more reliable
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bionic snapdragon yes bionic is better than snapdragon but in terms of performance camera and others snapdragon still wins
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post when it comes choosing iphones you just select the model and buy it while androids you have to choose brands which is the best for you and also you cannot compare bit os for low end device and apples locked os
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,finally the front looks different since
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,may go for it from samsung if they will not relise anything better than note ultra
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its honestly ugly but its still beast nonetheless its great in some aspec more dont forget samsung zfold series and vertu phones too
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still no proper back gesture and forced to use two hands that keeps me away from apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,am sure some people do heavy multi tasking there the ones who need the extra ram possibly the more ios doesnt allow to multitask neither running unused apps in background unlike android when they run apps in background without noticing the user so phone companies tend to put high ram size to trick old people to buy them imagine if you get low spec device but you have large ram
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,finally iphone gets mp camera bet the photo looks sharper than usual budget or midrange phones with mp
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ihk this is silly question but can install fortnite on it of course you can you can also install limbo and inside from app store
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,there are lots of reason why most people like iphone over android its battery efficient more my iphone pro max died after months never dropped once always with cover and screen protector doesnt have scratch it just died for no reason the screen went white have tried to restore with itunes but it didnt work have to bring it to apple and see what they say but its most likely an hardware problem its shame
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,excited specs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its interesting the points you said people why buy iphone the social status symbol more dont know if that concept ever crossed your mind but some people use iphones because they like them
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,can see you rarely or even never used an iphone do agree with some of your arguments thou more its interesting the points you said people why buy iphone the social status symbol lot people also buy iphone too fit in its more people buy iphone too try to impress mainstream people instead of trying to get the best phone possible for there money theres also them who are locked in the ecosystem that are basically stuck have said before only buy the cheapest most budget apple devices if need apple as the processor the same anyway its unfortunate the eu or us has not forced apple too allowe sideloading of apps apple fans are in need of help the ones who never tried android and have pay so much extra for little bit more ram or storage theres some people who never used android and know no different or better and android phones can get powerful at flagship price or get even an ultra budget android phone be good just for taste of freedom android can even be run inside of windows laptops as emulator for example andy os android gives you the full android os experience nearly everything works on android as far back as android so when it seems android updates make android age worse it might stay usable with more usability for longer also the alternative app stores like uptodown aptoide do add additional apps that give even better freedoms the best part is you dont even need any need email or phone number too use the app stores android so flexible and customize and its easy too use just so much choose
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yeah get what you are saying and more ram would be nice but not sure if its really necessa more am sure some people do heavy multi tasking there the ones who need the extra ram possibly they not having good experience on ios or the iphone we wait see in time about the gb ram and how well it ages for app usage and games ios might be fine forever on gb ram idk its possible software growing room might be limited by the gb ram or suffer from low ram the better cooling the vapour chamber definitely good start and step in the right direction want ever brand should really start doing is putting builtin fans in smartphone like laptops have its already normal for gaming phones too have active cooling fans but mainstream phone should adopt this standard though only the pro modals have only passive cooling so the cheaper iphone modals still overheat and dont even have passive cooling so the problem with cooling still not fixed and will only worsen and games are getting worse for overheating phones as there getting unreasonable heavy and system resource intensive so game developers are also at fault global warming goings make the would so much hotter in next years so phones will be trying to cool themselves under really bad conditions in future
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nice one
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,will never understand people who buy iphone for years already am in tech world more can see you rarely or even never used an iphone do agree with some of your arguments though except low quality screen nope for the oled screen variant the lcd variant is really good compared to other lcd but yeah its shame on and xr they used lcd for such high price at the release time low quality build yes only for old variant and older updates on purpose that destroy your phone after years nope ios still supported on iphone thats already years of support people usually buy iphones for several reasons camera photography social status most of the time in my country simple to use because of the simple ui even the elderly can use it just fine thanks to bunch of accessibility features integration with other apple products if you have other apple devices of course software support but yeah do agree ios needs more features and not too limiting the users to use anything they wanted really hope multiwindow reliable easy file transfer always on display are in ios because of this also have flagship android to accompany me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,about ram usage if you only open one thing at time the ram bandwidth limitations will no more yeah get what you are saying and more ram would be nice but not sure if its really necessary also there is rumours that the pro devices at least will get vapour chamber cooling for the first time so theres that too look forward to
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wth is this they just removed the notch and another chipset and mp switch to mp hope this is not the official if it is just wait for ultra literally better or has optical mean iphone still natural but samsung is on another level especially the display cause all android phones screen comes in samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if they said ios is well optimize in ram then why they increase ram size why not use and stic more am trying too save them from this kinda problem who knows how long till apple gets too just gb ram people are spending lot money too on low ram device know it works for now but the ram specs are just neglectful realistically least years iphones should of had gb ram this year apple should have there full line up with gb ram apple really brainwashed there fans and tech reviewers are biased and payed reviews dont help its sad too see people think its ok too spec device like this and have such high asking price even the ps from has gb ram and its console badly wish tech reviewer would call apple out on the low ram spec or someone would have strong opinion on apple like me and just say what they really think and say apple is out right scamming people but the iphone se not too bad value but tech reviewers so very biased and unwilling too roast apple or say apple is garbage if they think apple is garbage
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gb on ios is equal to gb on pixel or gb on miui its not about the ram itself but th more ram optimization is better on ios and iphones but that didnt mean you should handlecap the phone with less ram apple can easily put more ram in without barely any extra cost in manufacturing iphone vs android phones google pixel are far from the best android has too ofter xiaomi just avoid awful software the razer phone from has gb ram hz screen oneplus also had gb ram and got few software updates ram optimization dont change fact gb ram is still gb ram and thats small amount of ram games that are ram hungry will suffer on iphones with low ram ios cant change reality
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,personally usually loved iphone and its ios have flagship android and flagship ios so you have no right to lecture me but think for iphone series if they still using the lightning port and still dont have much real addition in features in ios prefer to keep my iphone and wait for or newer
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so basically console like phone is ok ram management is better on ios there no debate he more if they said ios is well optimize in ram then why they increase ram size why not use and stick to mb ram then lolalso ios os very strict cant do customization that muchnot fair haha
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lol most android users here are complaining about the ram size well apple knows how to prope more dont think youve ever used an iphone and how free it is to use android
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,still with lightning port and no fingerprintwaiting for this phone was mistake
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,welcome in apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,maybe they are good at hiding it but from my useage the iphone with gb ram has never had more about ram usage if you only open one thing at time the ram bandwidth limitations will not be visible if youre only doing basic tasks and newer versions of ios never needs much ram at all gb ram might even be ok but your still paying pound for basic needs my point is considering the price point higher amounts of ram is expected and better cooling system the easiest way know of too test the low ram theory is too open lots of stuff in the background and open more and more browser taps see at what point you need reload the browser tab because its no longer storage in ram the other possibly is how many tabs open till performance starts too get worse and at what point does phone hit the limit of how much it can handle or have open would still be worried about future apps and games and how much ram there going too need
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,at least the ram is faster but it doesnt change the fact its small amount on more maybe they are good at hiding it but from my useage the iphone with gb ram has never had any issues when it comes to ram so do believe in to years the gb ram in this phone will be perfectly fine as the likelihood is the standard iphone will still probably have gb ram by that point
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,please dont defend the company like that gb might be enough now but they are always bracin more well considering my iphone has gb ram and ive never had any issues with the ram dont think gb ram will be an issue for longevity im not defending apple its just obvious they have made choice with what is best for their devices with the plans they have for the next few years of updates gb ram on iphone is completely different to ios as gb on the iphone work as well as gb ram on android if not better so wouldnt complain about gb also with the fact the pros are going up in price already the less unnecessary upgrades the better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,looks like apple looking for suckers to buy its trashgalaxy ultra is king samsung kills their devices with every system update have two iphones xs max and that works fine what old samsung works fine now
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gb of ram is more than enough for ios devices also to add even though the ram is staying at more at least the ram is faster but it doesnt change the fact its small amount on very expensive device ios is very good at hiding the fact gb ram is not much though you might think its more than enough its probably not in years time after many os updates and apps and games growing bigger and more ram hungry is gb ram still going be ok its awful really apple not in the ram aims race trying too keep up apple is really holding themselves back there far behind in hardware in ways that are just unnecessary surely you still want little more ram
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,think theres huge gap between the activity processor performance between ios and most and more still its very expensive device and apple could of easily put little more in no level of optimization and processor tricky change the fact gb ram is still small amount ios definitely didnt need as much ram as android yet but this phone get years of updates roughly by then is gb ram really good choice future games and apps are not the same as the os and likely will be ram hungry just because you dont more ram surely you still want more ram dont you
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,downloading anonymous app from porn site will always endanger your own phone from what site
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,guess apple is finally being like android with their cams
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple should put gb ram in this at least hope apple does put gb ram in ram cheap pa more gb of ram is more than enough for ios devices also to add even though the ram is staying at gb it is going from lpddrx to lpddr which will allow for performance boost with regards to the ram which think is more important for the iphones at this point in time
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the rich will buy too expensive yeah damn too expensive
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this apple phone is going be so over priced and its hardware is so very unbalanced pr more think theres huge gap between the activity processor performance between ios and most androids with more than gb of ram you see the huge processor performance difference in android companies dare to install instead gb of ram in their flagship phones the analogy is that ios processor can compute more data in stated time compared to android processor hence clearing space that will be used to make other computational work android processors are quite slow so work to do piles up in the ram and if the ram is small the phone starts to lag thats majorly why android manufacturers put in more gb of ram in their devices an additional gb will be wasted since it will never be used my the processor even the gb to me is more than enough it all comes down to ram efficiency
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,youre smoking something if you think iphone looks like samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,first iphone with mp
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,usually people spent more in midrange phones not flagships android flagships are so expensiv more appreciate bro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,when first saw it thought it was huawei phone what an amazing resemblance
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,kind of disappointed expected tb storage upgrade no apple upgrading is minimum upgrade as usual
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow apple actually managed to make something that looks even worse than notch haha its an for iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,in spite of criticism and outrage about the notch and new features same people are already saving up to be the first to get once it drops trust me apple could release phone without screen and folks will grumble and then pay for it they have their fans in the bag
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,without doubt iphone is the worst phone ive ever used
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why dont have slot simcard because rich people dont use dual sim phones they have multiple devices
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,people have too much money jeez for more than and all this hype for the tiny bit more screen space and probably some minor improvement to camera like every year like are there that many people who spend just to upgrade after spending like on iphone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,although love apple design and network speed but apple still gives us same thing every more im not sure what you meant by apple releases phones too fast if new models per year is too fast then you should look at xiaomi how they publish devices per month additional different versions rebranded phones for other regions
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,is the best phone ive ever used shut up and stop kidding no such phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bro we are in and apple still at what is this even the previous phones all more wireless charging pro max can charge at so id expect that at minimum for the pro max also series brought the battery to the level of the competition and the pro max is one of the best for battery life out there
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thats only rumor doubt with mp cam and even battery is not specify
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this thing is slimmer than last years model and expected the telephoto to be periscope
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this new has almost no change only the screen which has taken decades am soon going to samsung
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,why is the back design of the phone the same as iphone thought it wouldve been obsol more it doesnt look like it more like ip pro ip has smaller cam bump compared to pro and pro
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cant wait to see your review hope youll take picture of the moon too because who doesnt love moon right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gsmarena really just put an ios lock screen on this when ios is already revealed the photo is not theirs
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow look at that charging speed thats so fast you cant even see phone charging more as samsung fan do hope that they will improve the charging speed in the upcoming models to at least is fine for my usage pattern but faster charging speed will be much better
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,though it would have higher screen to body ratio
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,let time would say about that everything has its end the point is that the reliability of apples products is good it will last long time especially compared to other brands such as sony
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not true the is no way apple will do gb ram iphone pro max no way pro max has gb of ram what are you talking about
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,am pwd and approve the notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,no way apple will give mp wide camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gb ram and mpx that will be for really high price as know how apple do their job but more let time would say about that everything has its end
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,talk about design
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,so you like the fat ugly notch mean small notch is good choice
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,thats true but apple needed to change at least little bit in design because some peopl more thats right
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just buy affordable iphone pro gbwith flagship cpu and update support years sa more the pros going to get way more than years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,these specs look accurate but thought it was supposed to have video recording leaks and rumors and even tech youtubers said there will be video recording still think well get and not other than that everything seems pretty accurate
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the phone features are cool but notch wouldve be better thats true but apple needed to change at least little bit in design because some people are not looking for parameters but for that how the phone looks
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,innovation stopped after the death of steve jobs sadly yes were either in stagnation of cool new tech to put in phones or just being dripfed lesser than previous years to justify something new
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,considering nowadays android phones prices ios has become more efficient money spend more just requesting for one for freebambi do me favour thank
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,lolat least your dead pixels symbolizes your mobile phone
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ios so expensive compared to android just buy affordable iphone pro gbwith flagship cpu and update support years same price with upper midrange androidwith support max years
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this is crazy design like notch as an iphone pro than this iphone if like punch hole more so you like the fat ugly notch
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow apple iphone is lairning from huawei thats all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,tbh would prefer the notch than whatever this is
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,not even gb ram seriously ios are well optimized unlike android with million companies left it unoptimized you dont need more than gb with iphones if you want more ram get vivo and oppo they usually offer lowmidrange spec at high prices since customers pay for ram size
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post sameiphone is reeally good but its just ios is not for me
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wowhorizon dot
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ugly sluggish the corner edges are too rounded it hasnt been revealed yet this is just really bad image of it

Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,this time ugly is new innovation from apple all new ugly that no other company could ever deliver
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nothing new no inovation
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,imo the notch is better fitting than this ugly dual hole
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,damn you lightning just get rid of that already
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,curious to know what kind of mp sensor apple will use for this phone maybe itll be the typical quad bayer sensor or native rgb sensor but that double punchhole at the front thats definitely not great look
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well mpx make sense for the megapixels when it binds
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if they put the microphone on the screen too
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,yall got to admit this looks cool af
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,we wait iphone pro max lol it is coming in years all are still the same they just change few things like design shape add up huge price think this is waste of resources tell what is the difference between pro and pro max now pro max will soon be out
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,nothing new iphone future
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well the ultra also has the same setup as last years ultra the zoom is helpful feature in some cases but most people dont use it as they dont need such high magnification
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,bought iphone week ago
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,jason aug iphones are madly expensive when some other phones are better than it in camera like hawei more its rumored to be euros as predict
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,does anyone remember when iphones used to have gorgeous designs and androids were uglier thank them well how are the turntables
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ultra is weight better than this apples so called pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,double nanosim variant is no longer available
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,its satisfying
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple fan boys was criticising the front punch hole camera when it was first out now the same apple fan boys will applaud this new feature
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,iphones are madly expensive when some other phones are better than it in camera like hawei and samsung galaxy ultra but many people dont know wonder the price of this one
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,very ugly notch design still people will go mad over this lol so youre the critic now
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,deleted post mate why are you even here then
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,huawei implemented face id sensor with less size on mate pro but this dude
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,oh yes apple finally started making megapixel camera
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cant wait for this to come out and for the general public to be absolutely revolted by more oh theyll love it apple fans are easy to please
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apologize to my self because thought that apple is going to replace the lightning port hu more they dont want to dump their charging technology away they thought usb can cause security issues
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the color is way too bright for the back but seperated notch looks ugly atleast just put it together it looks like letter and exclamation mark when watching vids on landscape or gaming
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,apple has made big mistake
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,the ugliest punch hole in smartphone history is here what innovation how they managed to make it too ugly
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,gates are open unleash your hate now no truth must be told as usual
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow didnt think they actually make it worse that display is something else back looks the same basically
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,well details were known months ago so was holding till the end tbf that makes sense the only things ive noticed with this is that the phone is rumoured to have taller display this year due to the hole punch panel so the is inaccurate not sure what the correct ratio is though also the front camera is reportedly going to with af and the phone should be capable of video from what the rumours are saying
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,just go back to the mustache notch apple
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,would never worry apple after all
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,pretty good
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,those frontfacing camera sensors waste more space than the previous forehead all these just to say innovation new updated lmao
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,ugly as always
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,if thats how the next model looks like omo the thing looks somehow weird and they should do something about the camera design as well
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,looks bit odd but aside from that nothing new guess
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,cant wait to test it
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,first comments on iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hope this one can last playing pubg on hz without stuttering in the first minutes without fan next to my ears
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,hmmmmm ok
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,waiting for this
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,do have to say wow
Apple,iPhone 14 Pro Max,wow iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,love you so much tm
Apple,iPhone 15,love the phone also want the iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,ive been using iphone for week now after switching from android to iphone must say it more you shouldnt use any other charger except the apples charger man that is repearing phones told me that its usefull for you to know that phones told me that
Apple,iPhone 15,just switched from android xiaomi note pro into iphone must say that iphone is weight around gram on iphone is game changer compare with my old phone xiaomi note pro gram the design of iphone is very premium luxury smooth and compact for gaming and can say its smooth and stable has best camera no bloatware ads or whatever very stable selling price in my country chipset still overkill and will last years long last major ios upgrade that will last minimum years until now thing that dislike still hz display but it doesnt matter anyway everything about it is very overpriced accessories phone case software etc storage is too little for nowadays bought gb and if you want higher storage like or maybe tb just be ready to burn your wallet dynamic island sometimes block your tap especially when you have big hands its sometimes annoy me when gaming or tap something near dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 15,you take apple iphone promax
Apple,iPhone 15,hello can is there any equalizer tuning app like poweramp equalizer for speakers on ioshaven more yes it does have in the settings music the best one for me since my ip ip mini and ip days is late night option recently found an article as to why there is glitchlike moment upon switching to the late night option like the sound will be stopped for brief moment and then play at the eqs late night configsetting there it says tsound is adjusted through the builtin sound compressor of the iphone which find amazing maybe this is why iphone speakers do sound amazing except for the pro max of their th gen it sounds tinny compared to its predecessor and my ears are very particular to sound quality anyway heres the link bout the compressor for everyone to read enjoy httpswwwredditcomrsennheisercommentsutxwlatenighteqpresetinios
Apple,iPhone 15,the mp resolution does intrigue me especially when the main camera sensor is built for to pixel binning in the first place its hard to make sense of it at first when comparing it against the mp photos side by side from this review article since the mp photo cant be downscaled to match the mp resolution so compared them using the photo compare tool personally speaking the mp resolution shows better detail and colour rendition than the mp resolution dare say it the mp resolution shows way less oversharpening effect than the mp resolution for long time the bionic iphone xrxsxs max has been my top choice for ios photography the new mp resolution option has won me over especially when it shows the same difference with the propro max version
Apple,iPhone 15,why wont they just make model for people who dont want to spend this amount of money more first it would be shit phone dont expect something better than the iphone second they are premium company so in conclusion because ut would be shit and they dont want
Apple,iPhone 15,why dont you like the been debating the last couple of days between the galaxy more must say apple is perfect combination on hardware and software use iphone and say that iphone cam is better than my samsung cam also the apple ecosystem helps lot which samsung and windows cant follow apple exactly yeah android and windows is different platform and even the chromebook is still far away with apple ecosystem iphone is rather simpler than any android
Apple,iPhone 15,that pill and lazerbeams in my eyes for face recognition ahem usb good step sti more why dont you like the been debating the last couple of days between the galaxy havent checked out the other two but as far as do know the is better iphone and iphone pro and kinda been lost with it all especially when tried the ipad before years ago and hated it and the macbook now and liked it would have gotten dell or something else instead tho but thats only cause itll be easier to study on for my course in terms of phones had the galaxy then then oppo neo
Apple,iPhone 15,what is battery backup
Apple,iPhone 15,you guys didnt mention how many charge cycles the iphone battery lasts before droping to battery health
Apple,iPhone 15,the most expensive hz phone in the world you forgot the iphone plus
Apple,iPhone 15,should buy this or wait for iphone you mean air because there will not come if you heard it on tiktok just dont believe everything on the internet
Apple,iPhone 15,is it an upgrade from pro its not really an upgrade
Apple,iPhone 15,im trying to decide between the samsung and the iphone gb ill mainly use it for more choose the it has better performance for gaming
Apple,iPhone 15,tricky depending on your priorities pro wins for camera pro featuresbattery life and more when it comes to the iphone key design feature is its frosted nonglossy glass back the camera system on the iphone benefits from improved image processing and updated color science which can result in more accurate and vibrant photos compared to the iphone pro the iphone pro does offer some advantages such as stainless steel frame instead of the aluminum frame on the iphone which some users might prefer for its premium feel and durability additionally the iphone pro features promotion technology with hz refresh rate providing smoother scrolling and more fluid user experience than the standard hz display on the iphone however for many users these differences in materials and display technology may not be significant enough to outweigh the other benefits of the iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,this or pro coming from an xs tricky depending on your priorities pro wins for camera pro featuresbattery life and matt back over the smudgy glossy back wins for ios update newer chip brighter screen dynamic island if you like it way lighter weight type port apple intelligence
Apple,iPhone 15,this or this over and over
Apple,iPhone 15,test drove this it was nice if had to choose any iphone to get right now would get thi more pro or
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone getting updates every other month unless its older than years ok
Apple,iPhone 15,so much frame drop after ios update with hz its not feel so smooth
Apple,iPhone 15,apple thinks thick bezels are cute but it prolly is for some users like me obv
Apple,iPhone 15,this phone sucked me off when wasnt looking
Apple,iPhone 15,you should pick samsung but watch out it might be barely accessable after years just more do you think getting the will be good option for someone on tight budget
Apple,iPhone 15,realise that most girls buy the pink colour iphone no sht sherlock
Apple,iPhone 15,actually still cant even buy an iphone even the iphone is still expensive in more you from which country buyed an iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,how many less ios updates one at most also people should take into consideration the colo more actually still cant even buy an iphone even the iphone is still expensive in our country
Apple,iPhone 15,the iphone has worse processor and less ram than what the se will have it will get les more how many less ios updates one at most also people should take into consideration the colors of the vanilla iphones that is why always like more the vanilla iphones they always have better colors iphone has only white and black colors and they look boring
Apple,iPhone 15,which is more better galaxy or iphone planning to upgrade by next years you should pick samsung but watch out it might be barely accessable after years just like the dont buy the iphone because it will be low on updates after those years
Apple,iPhone 15,doesnt worth the money iphone and is better there are better android phone you can get for that price
Apple,iPhone 15,minute of silence for those who thought will be better than
Apple,iPhone 15,yes exactly the one guy who commented that apple killed this phone by not giving more completely agree and want to bring up that that apple has been using machine learning and ai functions well integrated into the system and functional ios ipados and macos for long time and well before android today apple obviously has to keep up with the times in terms of ai and they are working on it but ai to date is just gimmick and im glad my iphone doesnt have this ugly batterydraining stuff those who dont understand that apples management is better than some delete an element in photo really bad so much so that my nephew with photoshop can already do better compared to other brands that push more on marketing than on real functions in the operating system then those people who think ai is so good says to me that they havent understood anything
Apple,iPhone 15,very few believe me yes exactly the one guy who commented that apple killed this phone by not giving it ai is being ridiculous longterm software support is far more important than gimmicky ai features only very few people care about
Apple,iPhone 15,lol how many people actually care about ai very few believe me
Apple,iPhone 15,anyone share ios update thoughts any issues so far havent done yet none also
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone seems like good phone really no point in buying an iphone for me would you gu more iphone and are good phones no issues atm
Apple,iPhone 15,apple killed that device by not supporting it with ai lol how many people actually care about ai
Apple,iPhone 15,freeze touchscreen but fixed in and bug with random hang when wake screen up not had any issues with my iphone on
Apple,iPhone 15,getting frustrated with android phones either go for flagship expensive or midrange sos more same yes iphone might as well get newest faster wireless charging
Apple,iPhone 15,apple has learned battery size matters now the base iphone battery exceeds the galaxy note flagships apple finally realized mah are joke
Apple,iPhone 15,it specification given on this website is wrong as its main camera does not record full hd video in and fps and merely records videos not more than fps so plz take care of it
Apple,iPhone 15,let mrpannag know if you get reply to this who is mrpannag is it codeword let me know
Apple,iPhone 15,is is think will be here in the uk no price rise
Apple,iPhone 15,used android before and since started with apple iphone iphone much more support fo more comparing to this phone httpsmgsmarenacomxiaomiredminotegphp
Apple,iPhone 15,abandoned in year because of gb ram thats an apple record and its much worse if you shelled out on pro know ai really isnt required but you also lose out on extra ram aka future proofing ultrawide autofocus camera control and action button
Apple,iPhone 15,would it be reasonable to swap my iphone pro max to this iphone no it is really not reasonable at all you got everything on pro except usbc and thats why bought just because usbc you can plug any otg usb without mfi requirement nor warning message which much and much cheaper than mfi lightning otg plug any pd cable from android phones even the iphone can do reverse charging to other iphone with lightning consider up to pro or wait until the next gen of iphone has much newer features than series
Apple,iPhone 15,funnyone thing didnt notice was that the max zoom is the same as the pro and more fyi the extra tele cam on iphone and mostly android only activate during sunlight and all other situation is handled by main cam even the zooming thing in low light
Apple,iPhone 15,its still better to have an option rather than being stuck at just hz literally almos more the way the animations are working dont feel the use of or as im not into gaming too but im not defending apple atleast it should have ltpo though
Apple,iPhone 15,ultra is hz know hz ultra but ive set it to hz
Apple,iPhone 15,its obvious he means that he is using his phone at hz and is not even bothered by more its still better to have an option rather than being stuck at just hz literally almost every single android for the same price as the iphone come with hz ltpo displays so why cant apple way to milk your customers with outdated tech
Apple,iPhone 15,httpsmgsmarenacomxiaomiredminotegphp yep the fact that this andro more used android before and since started with apple iphone iphone much more support for external devices wireless charging more performance and better stability apps almost never crashes much better camera quality even if it has more than less megapixels screen visually looks better better sound quality even bluetooth headphonesearphonesspeakers sound louder better construct quality its going to work at least for years most of xiaomi cheaper phones will have problems in years or less you pay less you get less not always but often have iphone and its still working fast and stable iphone and xiaomi lcds not originals almost have same prices when people broke iphone screen some changed like times for same phone xiaomi better to buy new phone if comparing lcd changing price and whole new phone but people change lcd if they have important information screens with more than hz are actually useless even youtube doesnt have more than fps menu looks faster but drain more battery
Apple,iPhone 15,im not bothered about hz screen have utra on hz screen also iphone still more to some extent its true apple has tweaked the ios animations in way that it looks faster than hz on android
Apple,iPhone 15,personally hard disagree went from hz android to hz iphone and even that small ju more httpsmgsmarenacomxiaomiredminotegphp yep the fact that this android up there can have hz display while an iphone is still stuck at hz is just laughable but thats apple for you they wont care as long as they keep riling in boatloads of money every year
Apple,iPhone 15,yep hz drains battery faster and also makes the phone heat up faster unless youre more personally hard disagree went from hz android to hz iphone and even that small jump back down made the iphone feel unfairly jittery in average ui use the iphone with hz screen would have been much closer to the ideal iphone in my opinion
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone is the most stupidest company it provides powerful phone yet the screen still hrtz more im not bothered about hz screen have utra on hz screen also iphone still very smooth for hz
Apple,iPhone 15,no not at alllast updates were back to back updates but before this ther more gap of months where have you been iphone here
Apple,iPhone 15,does anyone knows why monthly software updates are not coming anymore in any apple devices exc more iphone getting updates every other month unless its older than years
Apple,iPhone 15,new iphone is better than any android smartphone lol iphone is obsolete already joking
Apple,iPhone 15,with specs mentioned an android phone with good processor can be around but this phone more new iphone is better than any android smartphone
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone has years of security updates thats good
Apple,iPhone 15,settings accesibility motion reduce motion prefer crossfade transitio more just enabled these it feels crazy fast not sure why this is not enabled by default
Apple,iPhone 15,because its tool not fashion item at this point it kinda is fashion item
Apple,iPhone 15,if you wanna see my opinion go to my tik tok noochill
Apple,iPhone 15,can please get the either of the samsung devices when you upgrade thank you
Apple,iPhone 15,ill explain it slowly for people like you that may not get it as easily using hz more of course it is but this topic is not about war or homelessness talking about smartphones and the fact that using the iphone is nightmare compared to smartphones like the galaxy in terms of interface speed the existence of wars and homelessness does not mean that people cannot communicate on other topics using words that are convenient for them am not supporter of conservatism because it leads to slavery life in eternal stress and degradation of humanity also dont like apples conservative position and its not just about hate
Apple,iPhone 15,no just in addition to absurd lags in the os and pseudosecurity there is also hz screen more ill explain it slowly for people like you that may not get it as easily using hz is nightmare for you for other people war or homelessness are nightmares thats why said you must be well off
Apple,iPhone 15,nightmare you must be very well off if using hz display is nightmare for you no just in addition to absurd lags in the os and pseudosecurity there is also hz screen at the same time apple gadgets are not cheap they are expensive and expect more for the money good marketing bad reality hope they will correct themselves in time
Apple,iPhone 15,it feels like someone paid you for this text with hz and ios limitations is nightmare more settings accesibility motion reduce motion prefer crossfade transitions settings accesibility touch haptic touch fast enabling these options will help you significantly speed up your iphone regardless of its display dont really understand why apple hasnt made them enabled out of the box yet
Apple,iPhone 15,ah yes lets bring the ios limitations when were comparing two different phones more good joke
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone is full of bugs and customer support is just useless and uncapable of solving it af more stop capping you bought phone and in less than day you experienced all the bugs in the world okay
Apple,iPhone 15,its not necessarly about gaming once you try navigating the ui at buttery smooth more agree used to use laptop with hz rgb ips screen for some hours doing basic task documents editing reading browsing then returned to hz screen and even windows start menu animations were annoying and laggy
Apple,iPhone 15,new pale colors new uhhh samephoria
Apple,iPhone 15,bro if youre not gaming on yo phone hz is cool enough unless you want to play compe more its not necessarly about gaming once you try navigating the ui at buttery smooth hz hz will become choppy besides dollars phone that still come with hz display is just sad and cannot be excused my from years ago has hz screen
Apple,iPhone 15,sabir jun im learning to buy iphone am using now poco my device has hz display shoul more bro if youre not gaming on yo phone hz is cool enough unless you want to play competitive game only then hz isnt gonna do much gonna cause lagging and all
Apple,iPhone 15,im learning to buy iphone am using now poco my device has hz display should have problem from coming back hz display to hz display please advise
Apple,iPhone 15,sony dont give more than yearly updates unless im wrong years security updates years os upgrades
Apple,iPhone 15,samsung se or or or asus zenfone or google pixel or huawei moto more my se are starting to be bit slow at sending messages so time to update still have ori battery in both but se battery is better last days hrs is day
Apple,iPhone 15,save your money go for sony xperia vi instead of this sony dont give more than yearly updates unless im wrong
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone black camera borders colour really fades
Apple,iPhone 15,design looks nice and build quality is solid but honestly am very shocked that in you still only get hz display also the charging speed is not very impressive biggest flaw is definitely the screen nothing justifies such low quality screen in this price range
Apple,iPhone 15,they shouldnt have replaced the white color option with light blue thats egregious nobody should spend extra just to get white phone
Apple,iPhone 15,disappointed with this model my iphone pro is so much better than this one it easily heats lagging sometimes and most of all the recording audios from apps like tiktok and wesing were distorted it sounds like robot overall im having regrets with this one
Apple,iPhone 15,yeah but the bloatware is an issue oftentimes need third party apps to debloat which might more delete the bloatware
Apple,iPhone 15,agree with you it was very formidable option in the beginning and ticked almost all the box more agreed
Apple,iPhone 15,usb is one of the only reasons that this is better than the previous models of iphone and ho more why does it matter if its crippled version of usb only to have usbc connector makes no sense
Apple,iPhone 15,xiaomi is much better than this agree with you it was very formidable option in the beginning and ticked almost all the boxes including the budget only two issues persist the biggest positive point usp of xiaomi series is the camera which am not much interested with my biggest requirement is battery life along with the compact size and am not getting much favourable feedback from the users on this parameter also there are so many complaints about heating issue hence xiaomi is not the top choice as of now
Apple,iPhone 15,hi guys am presently using oneplus as my primary phone and searching one compact phone more samsung se or or or asus zenfone or google pixel or huawei motorola edge neo those all are compact phones depends on budget
Apple,iPhone 15,not mentioning the subpar hz on high priced phone in specifications isnt oversighted miss but remiss not move expected from gmsarenacom say what you want in the reviews but the specifications
Apple,iPhone 15,my sixmonthold iphone sometimes doesnt charge unless restart the device has anyone else experienced this issue
Apple,iPhone 15,nothing special agree nothing special with hrr if not with suitable content nor highly detailed keen eyes
Apple,iPhone 15,think iphone is the best phone ever it run very fast the batery time is ok and the conectivity is very good before that have had many good android phones but nothing is compare with iphone my phone buyed month ago and it ran very well thanks apple for this gadget it is my jewelry
Apple,iPhone 15,believe you never experienced hz refresh rate yet nothing special
Apple,iPhone 15,people who complain hz refresh rate in iphone much smoother than samsung hz this is more believe you never experienced hz refresh rate yet
Apple,iPhone 15,those are still better than iphone yeah but the bloatware is an issue oftentimes need third party apps to debloat which might give you virus
Apple,iPhone 15,actually when plan to buy an iphone with accidentally bought secondhand outda more those are still better than iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,if iphone was just iphone with gb ram gb storage grams weight and mm thickness for that would be all would wish for then iphone can be an iphone with hz aod and af ultrawide for macro and also the yearly chipbattery densitymodem upgrade and iphone even lighter below grams but im asking too much my wishes for iphone especially in the weight and dimension department wont even be fulfilled by iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,great joke those who own it know it simple
Apple,iPhone 15,nokia enters the chat with an even smaller mah battery and better battery life great joke
Apple,iPhone 15,mah and suppposed to last longer than batteries in androids makes no sense to me more nokia enters the chat with an even smaller mah battery and better battery life
Apple,iPhone 15,stick to your current phone you arent getting anything new or special you get the mp upgraded camera sensors from the pros but other than that yea most people will not see or feel difference so unless you mainly use your phone to take picturesvideos wait for the or nothing really to see here
Apple,iPhone 15,want buy this phonein azerbaijan iphone cost starting at az like is that good phone or not
Apple,iPhone 15,they cant even bother to give or even on their basic models its people the different phones for different kind of people doesnt really work here apple makes models year not they should include the option and it should be up to the individual whether to use it or not it would make sence if this was budget phone but apple doesnt do budget phones its sub dollar phone honestly everything else is great but going from hz screen to just cant do rant over
Apple,iPhone 15,good phone for the price and good battery only downside is that you cant transfer from ipad at all even if its updated to the newest version of ipados
Apple,iPhone 15,no its not and its fact every time see and try iphone etc it feels like they more may be to your eyes compared pro with my iphone only find the difference when scrolling otherwise dont find huge difference between and hz no lags for sure
Apple,iPhone 15,all iphones since the could record had the iphone and it was really good expect that the battery only lasted for an hour due to it being water damage definetly when apple peaked
Apple,iPhone 15,its hz refresh rate yes
Apple,iPhone 15,best camera ive ever seen on standard iphone love this phone ahhhhhhhhh all iphones since the could record
Apple,iPhone 15,great phone just cause its hz doesnt mean its the end of the world everyone is forgetting the fact that it has the bionic chip great battery life dynamic island light body and zoom despite not having dedicated telephoto lens the mp camera is great too so is usbc know its usb but dont really care nor know anyone who still transfers with cable really made the base models feel like pro with the matte back telephoto zoom and dynamic island no action button but does it really matter
Apple,iPhone 15,the iphone being an iphone is drawback no telephoto lens overpriced for what it is no more even tech youtubers like mkbhd says the best phone depends on what you use it for example my phone doesnt have fb insta other social apps installed but do spend lot of time on firefoxublock chrome and youtube revanced use youtube downloader lot too for long bustrain journeys where data coverage is spotty or rip the mps from the yt files and rebalance its volume levels via mpgain in termux and ahem flud torrent downloader for various reasons so for someone like me ios wouldnt allow nearly everything id expect my phone to do on the other hand if you need the absolute best video recording then sure go get the iphone pros no need to throw around blanket statements that this or that phone is the best when everyone uses phone differently
Apple,iPhone 15,maybe the was stretch but costing far less with similar specs with even more function more good one laughed lot tell me another joke you wouldnt even believe yourself
Apple,iPhone 15,with similar specs snapdragon the screen is sucky against en he iphone screen lolthey more the iphone being an iphone is drawback no telephoto lens overpriced for what it is no hz literally just for and it only has usb the is reaaalll big stretch but you get more for the money you spend hardware wise and where they cheap out the average user wont care the benefits of the are the expansion storage mm jack telephoto lens being easier to repair being more affordable not being locked into apples hellscape guaranteed to not be irrelevant generation later
Apple,iPhone 15,lol got the xperia as job phone and the iphone as private phone if really compar more maybe the was stretch but costing far less with similar specs with even more functionality its still better than the iphone which is just ewaste
Apple,iPhone 15,buy samsung or or xperia my mom has this and to me its mediocre more lol got the xperia as job phone and the iphone as private phone if really compare the phones then dont know where talking about the sony screencamerachipset suck against the iphone get killed by the iphone to hz or not is nice phone which can be compared
Apple,iPhone 15,grams too heavy for you grams case glass screen protector yes its less comfortable to hold for prolonged periods of time
Apple,iPhone 15,the is rumored to be grams they should make it lighter not heavier below grams more grams too heavy for you
Apple,iPhone 15,apple know that by giving the vanilla models high refresh screen it would devalue the usp of more good apple should revert every phone to hz or lower because why not think hz would suffice for most people you just simply dont need more it just works wouldnt that be terrific apple campaign
Apple,iPhone 15,never lags maybe got fake subscribe to this shows no lag at all samsung lag days think have set
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone iphone there isnt much of difference skip buy iphone if yo more totally acceptable
Apple,iPhone 15,nah buying this is like getting pulled literally okay that is absolutely your opinion care to offer some arguments toward your opinion
Apple,iPhone 15,this display is better cameras are much better you leave the outdated notch behind and more nah buying this is like getting pulled literally
Apple,iPhone 15,do iphones have aod not on the base iphones they dont use ltpo screens like the pro models so they loose that feature but it could come with or
Apple,iPhone 15,wish this thing was cheaper
Apple,iPhone 15,for me its good upgrade from xs or older but it wont be any good if upgrading from more lol imagine that phone isnt huge upgrade from phone thats why the base and plus models are trash and overpriced
Apple,iPhone 15,major upgrade for the base iphone models worth it to buy know you real you didnt bought it so why should be buy it
Apple,iPhone 15,bezels dont matter its the refresh rate oled screen with nits but only hz in more apple know that by giving the vanilla models high refresh screen it would devalue the usp of the pro models also most iphone consumers have only ever known hz so its not big deal to them
Apple,iPhone 15,bezels size is like from phone just hilarious even has slimmer bezels bezels dont matter its the refresh rate oled screen with nits but only hz in is just joke hz is the norm now aint mid range territory might as well get the last gen iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 15,the box was sealed and the manufacturing date is october however my concern is how come more well apple has new thing called guess its called an in box software update hence guess you got the latest ios version there in the box
Apple,iPhone 15,bad quality standards for what you pay for if dont mind changing from ios to android you better served with pixel pro or google or even samsung
Apple,iPhone 15,is gsmarena biased because the maths dont favor my opinion have seen both phones in real life and the difference between bezels and camera cutouts is huge
Apple,iPhone 15,is gsmarena apple biased when it comes to screentobody ratio there is no way that the iph more is gsmarena biased because the maths dont favor my opinion
Apple,iPhone 15,just come here to see comments of billionaires writing from my years old realme finally find someone like me
Apple,iPhone 15,why didnt add hz or hz in display specs
Apple,iPhone 15,how come has thinner bezels and the same screen as iphone but its still talle more its because the iphone has inch display while the iphone has inch display agree that iphone and se is the best size
Apple,iPhone 15,in my opinion stick with iphone samsung and all android devices are great in options but after more your comment is not entirely correct iphone is good if you just want to imessage have perfect instagram photos and have simple phone that does the basic things you want it to do they are also great for longevity especially if you replace the battery android phones high end have better battery life better screens faster charging better customisation better multitasking sideloading and more opportunities to get the most out of the phone but the tradeoff is no imessage and way less longevity if youre real power user if you want something simple that works and you care most about posting on social media or using imessage iphone if you want something that allows you to experiment and get the most out of your phone and are fine with less longevity android for the last years have had an iphone and an android at the same time the androids last half as long but also push them way harder
Apple,iPhone 15,if im using face id to open my phone why do still have to manually put my code in to times day
Apple,iPhone 15,the standard iphone still doesnt come with hz ltop display usb and the latest chipset this is very good news for me as can delay my iphone purchase until see what wanted to get good job tim cook will go spend my money on something else while wait for you finish up cooking my needed specs xd
Apple,iPhone 15,whats the manufacturing date of the phone is the box not sealed when you opened it the box was sealed and the manufacturing date is october however my concern is how come the phone had ios already installed instead of ios
Apple,iPhone 15,is anybody else facing battery draining issues on this phone have to charge it twice day more youre using the phone wrong apple
Apple,iPhone 15,maybe its also because macbooks have lcds with slower response times which makes stutter les more maybe but recently just bought an iphone which updated to ios and im getting the same kind of sluggishness where can see the frames during animations my ipod touch running ios on the other hand feels much more smoother seems that newer ios versions and interestingly newer android versions as well are less optimized for hz panels based from my experience
Apple,iPhone 15,great value iphone if you live in the usuk but man cannot stand the hz display having more maybe its also because macbooks have lcds with slower response times which makes stutter less noticeable
Apple,iPhone 15,if not china just go to vietnam thailand etc even south america manufacturing just not india is foxconn comapny is china or taiwan what happened to india for chip manufacturing when they are going to start what ever country manufacture the chip or cpu finally customers need good privacy and security without spying
Apple,iPhone 15,why bro is us going to give chip manufacturing order to china again some peoples are tellin more if not china just go to vietnam thailand etc even south america manufacturing just not india
Apple,iPhone 15,avoid buying india made iphone it has heating issues battery problems why bro is us going to give chip manufacturing order to china again some peoples are telling like that is it true bro
Apple,iPhone 15,love apple products and genuinely thought the was the best in years im not heavy mobi more mine are just stunning httpswwwsamsungcomlatinensmartphonesgalaxysultragallery
Apple,iPhone 15,you cant compare android with ios ios needs less battery tell that to or se and same battery maybe better as light performance mode
Apple,iPhone 15,ok hz omg criminal then ios is hot mess lol gifs was easier and cameras why look so ugly on iphones like cross eyes lol love my so much glad chose right and pics looked better apple is slipping
Apple,iPhone 15,checked both amazon and apple online store and both shows country of origin is china why can anyone confirm like can get that india orgin version from physical store or not
Apple,iPhone 15,go with latest the battery capacity mah is not enough in because ai need more battery capacity to work smoothly huawei mate battery capacity is mah and price also less than iphone note apple please look at the global market and release the iphone apple company need new strategy for ri
Apple,iPhone 15,pro or iphone go with latest
Apple,iPhone 15,dude that called this basic phone basic phones nowadays may have more than mah but at le more second of all forgot about this but if you used an android before of which did you could see even if you have gb probably like to gb is used by the os or rarely even more but on iphone it is from to gb for the os
Apple,iPhone 15,awful value for the price at least it has usb port which is good thing guess
Apple,iPhone 15,it should at least have hz adaptive refresh raterest phone is great basic phone hz display old chipset less than mah battery
Apple,iPhone 15,its very good phone there is no heating issue for iphone base model at least have more this requires considering the needs of everyone even used the charger that came with the iphonexs many years ago to charge the iphone after all for me as long as let my phone charge all night can use it all day however for some users they use phones more frequently need stronger battery life and faster to fill up their phones so any iphone is not qualified
Apple,iPhone 15,is preferable to buy iphone due to listed issues kindly do suggest heating issue more in terms of weight price and color matching the standard version of the iphone may have more advantages but it has no adaptive refresh rate screen no gbps usb type and no telephoto camera
Apple,iPhone 15,and still the iphone battery life kills the pixels iphones are known for great battery llife yeah right minis has bad battery life pro max max sot is it good to you dont think so
Apple,iPhone 15,for regular user not into raw imaging and using phone for work meetings netflix email no more just save those cash and invest on something better or possibly get decent workstation on sale its comparatively more worth than dumping cash on an odm slab where you arent gaining much in terms of specifications
Apple,iPhone 15,battery is mah and wh
Apple,iPhone 15,almost same screen size as pixel yet the battery is smaller and still the iphone battery life kills the pixels iphones are known for great battery llife
Apple,iPhone 15,yes like so many iphone users are ignorant sorry to say but it is they claim themselve not more they dont need your money they have enough consumer to sell their phone typical ignorant apple hater never used one but first to comment
Apple,iPhone 15,no always on display not even hrtz simply dont get it
Apple,iPhone 15,upload image in picture section
Apple,iPhone 15,best iphone base model for recent years better than pro series at least huge updates in many department but price is as same as last year waiting for blue one
Apple,iPhone 15,deserve that product what does that mean
Apple,iPhone 15,this is my dream phone visite my website bdknowledgecom
Apple,iPhone 15,it seems apple loves the trend of brightening the colors of their phones next year theyll make all of their phones white and call it different colors hell their blue on the iphone already looks white
Apple,iPhone 15,handled in store there were units with one noticed there was ridge that could be fe more deserve that product
Apple,iPhone 15,they up the power and lower the cooling parts thats so clever
Apple,iPhone 15,good information
Apple,iPhone 15,toaster preferred
Apple,iPhone 15,think you forget that the average user doesnt care about high refresh rate more yes like so many iphone users are ignorant sorry to say but it is they claim themselve not want to deal with any underlying tech the truth is when you switch to hz it is hard to get back apple could have made hz variable rate probably at no cost quite sure its marketing trick pushing to buy the pro version and put hz next year in ip also battery for life of smaller iphones if variable rate is not managed correctly battery could drops say more at full blast fixed hz so they can say we have awesome battery life sacrifying modern feature for that apple will be apple forever thats why like but have never ever bought
Apple,iPhone 15,it really does not feel like hz screen at all lol have it and ive been using for more just cuz dont notice it doesnt mean it shouldnt be included if ur paying flagship price you should get the flagship features hz being feature even found in midrangers nowadays
Apple,iPhone 15,iphone in black is one of the best looking phones ever made the contoured edges smooth bl more the black one is so bland and boring the other colours are fun and lively have the blue one initially wanted the green one but as it was sold out opted for the blue one
Apple,iPhone 15,euroes and no hz or refresh rate apple users stuck in as usual it really does not feel like hz screen at all lol have it and ive been using for the past week and its absolutely wonderful animations are super fluid and crisp you genuinely do not notice it
Apple,iPhone 15,rest in peace midnight and starlight you wont be missed what is missed though is proper whitesilver option guess the blue will have to take that role this time around
Apple,iPhone 15,plagued with issues overheating lots good old apple innovation lol that only applies to the pro models bruh
Apple,iPhone 15,have anyone test the speed is it
Apple,iPhone 15,but so small screen no what do you do on it yes its small but does not bother me use to make calls text whatsapp internet email play games and so on
Apple,iPhone 15,thats to small is ideal size had inch phone from the past and sometimes it falls out from the pocket not really ideal thats why im happy with my iphone se and does not fall out
Apple,iPhone 15,it looks like the end of mini iphone as the apple has stop making small phones apple are busy more thats to small is ideal size
Apple,iPhone 15,ios accessing gifs was better easier before going backwards still the winner
Apple,iPhone 15,then keep your iphone dont have an iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,still think replacing inch with inch was wrong then keep your iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,the battery is disappointed didnt know batteries could express disappointment
Apple,iPhone 15,no hrr and no telephoto should be crime for this price point as all competitors except zenfo more telephoto takes up extra space and the main offers zoom im quite happy that this does not have big heavy and thick camera bump but offers all most important zoom levels just like how it was with iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 15,camera now shoots mp photos
Apple,iPhone 15,as much as apple messes with us with the pricing ladder im going with the iphone more the choppiness youre experiencing isnt tied to the refresh rate its actually due to the system on chip soc if you take moment to scroll through pages or feeds youll notice distinct variance between the ipad air and the ipad pro however it ultimately comes down to personal preference in my view hz is perfectly acceptable have samsung phone with hz display but ive opted to set it to hz to extend the battery life the user interface remains impressively smooth only the scrolling is slightly less fluid compared to hz
Apple,iPhone 15,fps video on iphone fps video on android too right lol great
Apple,iPhone 15,exactly tried different devices in stores many times and can confirm this well if you used budget device with hz then yes can definitely notice choppy hz on any hz iphone coming from hz flagship or even high end midranger especially when scrolling
Apple,iPhone 15,its great but its not very different hz iphone hz other brand exactly tried different devices in stores many times and can confirm this
Apple,iPhone 15,as someone who never owns an iphone myself im thinking about who this belongs to and here are my thoughtsimo and tldr as gamer myself wont buy this as preference may not care about the refresh rate though for average users this is just okay if they cant notice the difference of the refresh rate sounds to me this is intended because apple wanted to prolong the battery life and because theyre using year old bionic chipset it makes sense if were to buy this would consider giving up gaming and just use it to browse social media or watch streaming apps and do callstext most of the time however it should still be possible to gaming since its like the pro modelsbut only limited may not care about the data transfer mbps too if dont have macbook or any laptop in general to transfer files to one another and you dont edit videos or photos like pro photographersdesigners do another gripes have is the build quality of this phone sure the build is aluminum like last year but the color is not for me just checked mkbhd new iphone unboxing video today and the color lookswhite majority maybe its his camera as dude ill go for the black one instead overall iphone think is for those looking for budget and average users might buy this as gift to my momgrandma though thats how average the phone is as gamer myself ill buy the iphone pro instead
Apple,iPhone 15,plus should have atleast got refresh rate hz like the google pixel did instead of the hz its time thry upgraded to the next like the pro models
Apple,iPhone 15,for the average users even average users still prefer pro and pro max models
Apple,iPhone 15,if pro and pro max models sold well then what is the point of making regular and plus then for the average users
Apple,iPhone 15,usb is gen gbps because of fps hdr support the same port of ipad air
Apple,iPhone 15,isnt just crazy that phone comes with hz and gb model in ohhh forgot who would then buy pro models apple is great
Apple,iPhone 15,stock android phones with hz are silky smooth unless its samsung or bbk so good at marketing so then you buy the max pro plus megadrive for something which could even be there already in display chips just disabled and not tweable in ios would have cost them almost nothing to include simply marketing trick so theyll put next year for ip guess its also for battery they didnt put battery is weak already can drain easily more battery it basically push the dac two times faster so gpu redraw more often then tax on cpu certainly too and hardly can be optimized suppose maybe all of that dont bother hz myself but yeah thinking android display is more fluid and run smoother than ios nowadays makes me laugh especially knowing android relies and tons of old shit compatibility layers graphics drivers frameworks
Apple,iPhone 15,can you update specifications is battery size not official latest rumors
Apple,iPhone 15,good hardware but still apple wallen garden even sideload they will fake it so it wont really be usable have always disliked apple for their private proprietary pseudosmart things otherwise they do great hardware but its in their dna with mac apple ii that what made apple successful and that always what made them failed later many times wont be surprised that will happen again they dont learn from their own history anyway samsung apple phones are like tomaytotomhato now id like an iphone without ugly lasers in my face pill and customability of samsung like an iphone you can order tuning color back plastic or glass unlock laser face button screen no useless magshit like when you buy car you choose real options that would be great thanks there freedom of speech rarely on internet can post our real opinion nowadays
Apple,iPhone 15,action button what brilliant idea as an android user hope android vendors are going to copy it whenever apple does something good am thankful for this reason it will be copied by the rest of the vendors it is in effect the equivalent of the fn buttons on dslm cameras
Apple,iPhone 15,so youre paying this heck of price for an bionic chip wouldve liked this strategy more stock android phones with hz are silky smooth unless its samsung or bbk
Apple,iPhone 15,currently am using an iphone gb model and the battery is getting old need an upgrad more just replace the battery if your iphone the series is still supported and fast if you really want to upgrade get the iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,is upgrading from iphone worth it ps im years old would just get the iphone for much less and youre not missing much in features
Apple,iPhone 15,in nigeria this phone will cost over million right just hope xiaomi series will be available in nigeria cuz all we have is samsung apple and redmi
Apple,iPhone 15,thank bro ur welcome
Apple,iPhone 15,pink color
Apple,iPhone 15,yes thank bro
Apple,iPhone 15,does this thing get the stacked sensor talked about in the rumours no
Apple,iPhone 15,even cheap android phones have hz hz hz screen and phone in still comes with hz display this is stealing and think apple will regret making the and plus model this way because the sales level will be very low
Apple,iPhone 15,how do apple get away with hz screen on dollar phone in is beyond me do they
Apple,iPhone 15,reallyhz with that price just because that apple brand on it this is more like stealing than selling phonealso non fast charge they have no lowrange phone or middle range and also the flagship phones are nonsense also the appearance is not change at alllike years ago
Apple,iPhone 15,why not pro is always better if you have the extra cash
Apple,iPhone 15,more like more its anywhere from very select unknown shops to from samsung the more im talking about the price here apple products are always way more expensive than the competition cuz apple tax
Apple,iPhone 15,currently have iphone but is it worth upgrading to iphone yes
Apple,iPhone 15,the iphone ranges are totally the same crap as the range there is no difference in size more currently have iphone but is it worth upgrading to iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,ram is gb and the refresh rate is still hz camera is still the same who said camera is still the same did you read the camera specs another troller
Apple,iPhone 15,worlds best smartphone having hz in out of many things iphone has you just talk about one thing which is immaterial though be grateful for iphone cause no phone can stand before it geez bionic its like ferrari
Apple,iPhone 15,yeah nevermind it cost almost double of galaxy more like more its anywhere from very select unknown shops to from samsung the will be what is an overpriced phone anyway like all their phones are
Apple,iPhone 15,goodbye notch you wont be missed also the people who bought the regular iphone must be pissed if they waited another year they could have avoided the notch
Apple,iPhone 15,it looks great finaly we have cutout instead of notch on base model as well as frost more yeah nevermind it cost almost double of galaxy
Apple,iPhone 15,horrible washedout colors this year not even starlight option hahaha exactly im agree with you
Apple,iPhone 15,hz awful
Apple,iPhone 15,its great phone ordered
Apple,iPhone 15,thats why have fast charging and hz screen had the iphone till the you have an for its fast charging really charging may be faster than what apple offers but its not fast
Apple,iPhone 15,usd for usb and watt fast charging is fine for some guy and girls my phone costs more thats why have fast charging and hz screen had the iphone till the
Apple,iPhone 15,skip the get the or wait for the if you really want an iphone the is not worth it also usbc still hzapple should step up its game but since there is no competition and people are imprisoned by their eco systemits hard to break free
Apple,iPhone 15,phone for hz and usb while you can find the pro at that price seems like the more its great but its not very different hz iphone hz other brand
Apple,iPhone 15,wooow
Apple,iPhone 15,your literally getting last years pro camera and software featurethat is it why on earth would anyone consider the over the pro is beyond me well played apple guess theyre the richest company in the world for reason
Apple,iPhone 15,just got the first copy from the officiel store and it didnt startturn on was lucky enough tried that in front of the seller and they gave me another one in less than minutes
Apple,iPhone 15,for hz display what lovely deal never change apple
Apple,iPhone 15,apple still thinks refresh rate is premium feature its not like that apple will only provide hz with ltpo display which have supply constraint to be available for all non pro iphones as only lg and samsung producing this display by chinese company boe will be able to fullfill ltpo display demands for non pro iphones so will be included in iphone non pro
Apple,iPhone 15,still hz display really
Apple,iPhone 15,nvme ufs is more than twice as fast as nvme
Apple,iPhone 15,nvme
Apple,iPhone 15,for hz display lol better to wait for google pixel pro
Apple,iPhone 15,traditional white color ia gone for non pros really disappointing
Apple,iPhone 15,then why hz in pro max because apple wants people to buy the more profitable pro and pro max
Apple,iPhone 15,ah yes im very sure the se is going to be more like for the fanboys iphones all they have to do is saying brand new iphone for less than that even if it come out at that price range also that gb of base storage is bottle neck nowadays let alone in the next years remembering how long the software update will be wonder how much storage the se will start
Apple,iPhone 15,common misconception that apple users just buy the phone based on the specs hz vs hz really like the average user would even know the difference the phones work well in their intended ecosystem by users who are willing to pay premium for product that they enjoy using seamless integration between various apple devices and ios that has familiar vibe through all releases gives consistency for the user not everyone requires knee jerk reaction to follow trends that are not necessarily proven and slower uptake on the technologies that do make difference ensures longevity of the product the build quality provides phone that lasts long enough to make the investment worthwhile and still have device that can be traded in when new product is purchased price vs experience you remember if something was good or bad not cheap or expensive
Apple,iPhone 15,usd no fast charging hz display probably mah not worth it imo
Apple,iPhone 15,bilions of same stuff and still no hz and no fast charge you cant expect more from flagship tiktok machine
Apple,iPhone 15,retail from aud wow can literally buy pixel for half that apples loosing the plot wholey cow
Apple,iPhone 15,dude ios isnt android butter smooth doesnt need then why hz in pro max
Apple,iPhone 15,frame seriously dude ios isnt android butter smooth doesnt need
Apple,iPhone 15,screen refresh rate hz
Apple,iPhone 15,what joke woulda picked up moved back into the apple universe had they bumped the charging and refresh rate even just to hz
Apple,iPhone 15,guess apple didnt hear about the backlash when oneplus removed the alert slider then again when apple does it everybody will copy
Apple,iPhone 15,like apple but the fact that this phone costs as much as it does and it doesnt even come with usb port is ridiculous combined with the fact it still uses hz display when literally every budget android phone has at least hz refresh rate in
Apple,iPhone 15,type and for pros genius samsung and pixel had at launching
Apple,iPhone 15,when you consider your users as chimps and apes you will sell them smart phone with hz display why no one is taking this seriously its shameful and insulting at the same time
Apple,iPhone 15,hz refresh rate lol
Apple,iPhone 15,finally an iphone with usb port can now think of getting an iphone
Apple,iPhone 15,hz screen anyone who buys this is mug
Apple,iPhone 15,well not worth upgrade from my no high refresh rate no fast charge and one step processor doesnt de hundreds of dollars they ask
Apple,iPhone 15,hz is inexcusable at this price in this day and age
Apple,iPhone 15,should have been mm mm form factor
Apple,iPhone 15,same thing with dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,call apple my family we became friends over the snow leopard apple operating system wanted one so bad while everyone else had windows get it never did get the snow leopard because could not afford it but it was beautiful dream did later get laptop from apple and it was so superior and hid it for about month before it was stolen and im so glad used my mothers credit card to buy it because it was so worth her money even for month they rule in my book as for me whats not to love just ask me anyway iphone plus is apples way of saying we know whats good you get what you pay for they are expensive but so is perfect lambs leather dress skin tight and beautiful on its worth the price you just have to charge it right
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,funny how everyone lies you see there is no iphoneplus for sale because it does not exist for the public am the only one who has iphoneplus apple made plus just for me why because we love each other know quality when see it and so do they love and trust apple to be as special as they have always been it was the snow leopard that
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,seeing the comments about refresh rate and pricing dont buy if its not suited for your needs had the for week the battery is great replacing my hz xiaomi screen compared to hz iphone its noticeable if you compared it directly but in matter of days youll get used to it currently have the ipad mini for my secondary device with also hz so the refresh rate change dont bother me at all just enjoy the device
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,the button of notch works in colder climatesunlike most smart phone screensfyi if you more too bad asia market is the biggest market for iphones
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,can definitely tell that the hz in ios is way laggier than hz in android nice saying that you are broke and have to coupe and glorify the android phone you can buy
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,yea did just had my plus for month now but battery drain so fast yes my iphone also bettery drain sofast
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,hello all do anyone experienced fast drain to their iphone plus yea did just had my plus for month now but battery drain so fast
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,iphone plus dont have that battery life it will drain for hrs after charging even you dont use the phone much
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,pls go and check your eyes dont know who are you but if you cant see the difference betwe more hz ios is just as smooth as hz android meant
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,you really can or is it just placebo effect pls go and check your eyes dont know who are you but if you cant see the difference between hz and hz your eyes are having some problems
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,try scrolling on hz android vs hz apple and tell me if you can see the difference more can definitely tell that the hz in ios is way laggier than hz in android
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,iphone plus camera is junk and picture quality is mush worse the cheapest android phone not worth at all
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,if you cant see the difference between hz and hz and it doesnt matter whether its iphone more it depends upon what you are using the phone for as to whether the screen refresh rate makes any discernible difference perhaps if you are watching video or playing game then it is possibility though not probable that you may get some tearing for pretty much all apps that do not use motion video which is what most users use their phones for it wont make any difference aside from eating through your battery quicker due to the increased speed that your display screen chipset is using
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,most iphone owners and casuals know nothing about refresh rates so they dont care know but not interested at all hz smooth enough for everything for most users
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,explain why is it overpriced its almost in europe for last years chip hertz screen very basic camera setup usb and so on its not even close to competitive to other phones at that price range and should not break and even that is kind of stretch when something like an easily beats it in specs while also offering updates for many years besides the operating system and slightly longer potential updates there is nothing the iphone really rivals it when last years pro is straight up better device besides still having lightning something is very wrong
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,actually its newer sensor its newer sensor but its not the same used in the pro pro max even though it too uses mp
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,only hz display in in such expensive phone mp camera sensor not same as the sensor more actually its newer sensor
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,paying this much money for hz screen just aint it try scrolling on hz android vs hz apple and tell me if you can see the difference yes its not hz ios vs hz ios for reason
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,for what is completely overpriced phone wow explain why is it overpriced
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,its called marketing pretty sure they review all sizes of samsung phones as well
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,why the multiple reviews of the same phone its called marketing
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,is more like the competition for this device but yeah since ultra price has dropped its now the best bang for your buck
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,the battery test is not accurate because it scored exactly like the regular but the battery lasts even better than pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,ive followed gsmarena for many years this is the first time ive doubted their numbers and their review every other tester on youtube and websites show the iphone plus outperforms the pro max in terms of battery and was confident you guys would give rating in line with everyone else but only gsmarena is showing otherwise either your tests are flawed or youre pushing different agenda come on guys youre better than this
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,im sorry but why again does part of this review look like some agenda pushing bs again it might not be but how this team running the site is just confusing now especially with certain use of language to embellish devices and very what seems tactical ways of presenting infomation they have gathered battery test still needs looking at and re working because its giving false un real life results also why again is the iphone only being put up against xiaomi device and the rest against itself and samsung do other companies not exist where are mid rangers that people buy and budget phones if someone wants the best battery phone and budget phone can give then double the battery life then they need to know this why no moto phones oneplus oppo more xiaomi want info that shows me clear indication of how the battery performs and against as many comprtitors from variety of companies even if it makes the compeitiors look worse we need un biasedun subjective reviews and they clearly arent this problem runs in to the charging portion wont show any device that can beat its charging except galaxy phone you even put sony flagship in the mix which we know charge slow why wasnt this same sony phone in the screen brightness or battery test yet specifically in the charging section instead of filling most catagories with just last gen iphones only and pm should be in it tbh at beet case why again is the samsung phone being shown to essentially be the only compareable device to an iphone it just looks like manipulation of infomation the iphone series can run with the best of them we know this without reading the review knew the plus would be very good phone but imo too expensive again the team need to be far more ciritical and expansive with the infomation they give for multiple markets not just usa and europe start showing this against all competitors and at the end be unsubjective and explain openly because the closing segment has been lacking massively for while with most phones and the way certain phones get very subjective compliments and embellished vocabulary to promote devices pixels seriously get this lot its just not right anymore and shows the site slipping no where near the standard it was years ago
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,its quite surprising that apple has toned down the sharpening on iphone mp output significantly while grass and small textures still look smudged due to fairly aggressive noise reduction at least it no longer suffers from that splotchy oilpainting effect of iphone camera that made all the textures in photo look ugly and unnatural as hell
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,dont care about the hz display just hate the fact that it comes with last years chipset instead of just an
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,not boding well for those looking for smaller phones most oems will stop making sub more yeah unfortunately smaller phones are more expensive to make as well so the cost for similarly specced smaller phone compared to larger one will be higher
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,seriously nicelooking phone but how oh how can you ask more than euros for hz screen in in this respect we should compare it with phones that cost no more than euros obviously cranking it to hz will be huge thing next year but still
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,like gsmarena mentions this phone is already obsolete from the pro max until it is discontinued alsothe fact that it is way more expensive than android flagships like sultra doesnt help either last but not least expected it to have better battery life compared to pro maxbigger batteryonly hz screenlower max brightnessyet it didnt and the loudspeakers this year are worse all in all too expensiveeven for iphone standardsfor what it offers
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,and you would bash any other company doing same except huawei and oppo satisfied with sco more wont bash it if the output is good and apples implementation of the said mp default output definitely has good quality if its oppo huawei xiaomi samsung or vivo it doesnt matter as dont take who has done it into the consideration its not my fault that your favorite brands implementation of quad bayer sensor is significantly worse than honor view from keep hoping though someday they will get where the other manufacturers are right now
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,think for series not necessary to write two reviews for only difference is go more the performance could be different due to the difference in heat dissipation speaker qualityvolume due to the possibility of two phones using differently sized speakers display quality charging time etc so yes you will need separate review for each of the iphone and plus
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,usb and hz bruh
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,its interesting that the night mode on the new iphones doesnt even improve the ima more and you would bash any other company doing same except huawei and oppo satisfied with score or gonna support those that want reduction
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,just came back from lesbos greek and it was pain to get stable mobile network over there even had to manualy go down from to as would even get edge two or three times per day was thinking its due to the fact its an island but my girl friend had zero problem with her iphone se for two weeks wondering if anyone did encounter the same kind of problem with their iphone plus
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,do have oroblem with your phone heating yes while using the adapter getting much heat around middle of the phone area while using or below doesnt get heat
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,average phone for gaming played call of duty mobile with fingers got fps constant zero lag but in this budget you can get red magic with to fps
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,oneplus or iphone plus the plus is best battery time can used it one time charge whole day
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,the thing is the camera rings paint gets scratch by its own knowing that have case that wi more buy lense protector
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,battery cycles of plus and battery health still well done apple these days battery is most important thing for smartphones thats diffrent story how much we use
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,two months back bought this till no problem battery for cycle battery health is more am using iphone plus first time from december charging cycles have been completed till march now battery health is only as per the company information battery health will be retained after cycles but think it will definitely not happen my next smartphone will be an android phone only camera is the one and only positive feature in iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,iphone because it has better battery life
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,or this plus anytime
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,can believe people here are comparing oneplus with iphone plus this has got to be joke right for its price the oneplus outclasses the plus in every department expect os updateds and people saying iphones have better resale value you do know that screen replacement on plus is kinr and battery replacement is kinr
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,being an iphone user one should not say that oneplus is overpriced in fact op is the mo more and the resale value of the iphone is much higher
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,plus which is better in terms of camera display and battery between iphone plus and oneplus
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,make it will buy
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,read one article if we complete cycles count then battery age will go to and we need more android battery now days dual cell are more efficient than iphones
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,im in the same boat im debating between the iphone plus and and im more
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,this or plus both good but should be with gen
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,samsung battery has an endurance of hours but iphone plus it is better have hou more you dont compare iphone to galaxy there two different operating systems and run on totally different software learn electronics
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,trulyyolo may have the as and im thinking of switching to the plus im afraid of losing more samsung battery has an endurance of hours but iphone plus it is better have hours have hours browsing and hours watching videos iphone plus have hours browsing and watching videos
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,slow charging of battery only watts battery of mah with watts charger charge more not true iphone only have on wifi charging but with charger provided charging wattage of approximately whereas the charger lagged at maximum output of im using charger
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,bro it has macro camera function in uw and lasts more than as have the as and im thinking of switching to the plus im afraid of losing battery capacitywould you advise changing

Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,source trust me bro trust you bro
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,apple company need new rd for their products note apple we dont like ai bec more stop spreading your bs conspiracies
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,if the pro max is new then for better experience get the pro max but for more longevity more apple company need new rd for their products note apple we dont like ai because its needed more battery power to run smoothly
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,hello there someone offered me gift to buy new phone upto so which one is good ide more if the pro max is new then for better experience get the pro max but for more longevity get the plus personally if have to choose then ill get the pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,thats just ridiculous and it sounds to me like you have never used phone with fast more no but seriously also have pro max and could not tell any diff
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,hz iphone doesnt even feel like hz have an ipad air and plus their interfa more thats just ridiculous and it sounds to me like you have never used phone with fast refresh rate used to think the same like you until made the jump to hz and now hz looks unbearably slow
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,the plus is still ripoff like last year youre paying the same price as pro max more hz iphone doesnt even feel like hz have an ipad air and plus their interface animations were extremely smooth in fact much smoother otherwise about the same smoothness as hz android just try for yourself and youll know
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,too bad if only it has the latest chipset maybe consider this phone welp not for me more be grateful that it doesnt have inside the only neat iphones this year are the nonpros there are weekly new bugs and errors appearing with the pros they even rumour that the new update clocks down the cpu so it doesnt overheat
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,if this had hz there would be literally no reason to buy the pro max chipset and cameras ar more agree if it had hz id never buy pro model again im in kind of lovehate relationship with the plus id love to buy it but dont know if could rock hz screen after pm
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,received my phone on nd october it worked fine on nd and rd but from th october during facetime call my voice become inaudible to the person am talking with when switch to back camera it worked fine with front camera but with back camera my voice is not heard by the person on line with me in whatsapp video calls sometimes become inaudible at first though it was network issue but after while seeing others not facing the same problem with the same phone and my already trouble with facetime made me realize its my phones problem am not sure if its an user specific problem for me or some others faced the same issue asked for refund will ship the phone tomorrow
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,did you really get the plus after having the plus if you did then why cuz theyre more no it not the same phone differences ive noticed modem is lot better in the iphone plus example my room is dead spot for connectivity but with the iphone plus modem get connection in my room now cameras is big upgrade for me speakers are better usb is life saver as can just transfer stuff to usb without computer screen is lot brighter outdoorsbattery is world class and couple of hours extra on the iphone plus so theres lot of reasons to upgrade imo
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,yep this seems the perfect iphone to get this year it showed that of the chipset is efficient more true talk
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,how many years apple gives software update support for their phones years ph more because newer apple silicone chipsets in macbooks works efficiently and doesnt require fan
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,if youre serious about gaming why not just use pc rather than small mobile screen more mean you can pair controller to phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,the back material looks cheap why existing customers and new customers are buying apple phones reasons are design rock solid hardware long term use worth for money but now all are wasted come on apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,its not about how smooth ios is cant play games with fps cuz of hz scree more if youre serious about gaming why not just use pc rather than small mobile screen with poor controls
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,im android user and cant stan people talking about phones that have something that iphone more how many years apple gives software update support for their phones years phone manufactures are giving os upgrade support and years security update support for this is much enough but for iphone price is it worth for their support even apple mac air laptops are comes without cooling fan why is it big cost for apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,literally the same as its predecessor
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,are those phones pushing nits peak brightness dolby vision and hdr too pro mod more im android user and cant stan people talking about phones that have something that iphone dont have but those phones are unusable after months but think the better buy would be pm same if not lower price
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,its amazing how phones can have hz screens and this brand new smartphone from app more are those phones pushing nits peak brightness dolby vision and hdr too pro models have the higher refresh rates if you really need it
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,battery backup not good hrs only youtube play volume dont buy great help and good advice
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,apple finally introducing hz on sounds pretty realistic tbf no they are not they last long years while being top notch in their performance
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,now that geekerwan posted his indepth performance and efficiency review this model seems lik more its not about how smooth ios is cant play games with fps cuz of hz screen all ui are smooth nowadays but when scrolling its nnt better than sammy buy what want and stop comparing akk phone to samsung
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,the colour choice they picks looked like for kids lol nah the design is sleek in person especially the blue and pink except the silly yellow
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,battery size doesnt really matter if you look the pro max roughty last aorund hour mo more what you just said is lie bro iphone pro maxs battery is no where near the galaxy ultra
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,ugliest phone to me the colour choice they picks looked like for kids lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,iphone battery not so good by must be at least mah battery size doesnt really matter if you look the pro max roughty last aorund hour more than the samsung ulta the iphone pro max has smaller battery size while the ultra has bigger mh battery size the pro max last longer becuase of the chipset inside the phone the iphone is more effecient compared to the ultra
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,dr watson sep think waiting until next year for the or years for the is probably the better opti more apple finally introducing hz on sounds pretty realistic tbf
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,apple products are waste of money but why people not recognising it why do people always waste their money for to life products
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,thank goodness its lighter than the iphone plus way to go
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,hz for us dollar phone hahhahahahahahaha
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,hz in its joke faiv plas faiv is sevetiin
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,still hz not even hz worst iphone just with big price absolutely
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,hooman eye can only see fps so my eyes cant see it if over fps
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,your tv still hz bozzo buy pc for you game chatting or social media enough clearly some apple fanboy hasnt heard about portability
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,apple almost killed iphone pro max with this model
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,yeah but the hz is even worse though hooman eye can only see fps
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,guy do you all think that after steve job went to heaven the apple even worst than before more how creative is called creative need to be more creative than android counterpart such as having flipped screen smartphone punch hole instead of tablet hole higher camera resolutions higher telephoto zoom camera in display fingerprint higher screen resolutions faster charging speed
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,am only thinking about hz
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,thats so lame yeah but the hz is even worse though
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,still hz
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,major camera upgrade display too
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,usb nothing more to say
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,really would have love have iphone plus in but nothing much has changed same battery even budget phones get atleast to mah on android battery for half the price and hz is complete no
Apple,iPhone 15 Plus,just like last year rebranded iphone pro max with one less camera and less refresh rate iphone pro max iphone plus iphone pro max iphone plus its big of apple to follow android brands to repurpose design and innovate it in different name
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,its perfect from all the specs an features but the only issue is the battery it drains quick which iphone is better to buy between iphone pro iphone pro and iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,people still using iphone pro can you tell me its pros and cons am planning to get it its perfect from all the specs an features but the only issue is the battery it drains quick
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,good prodct
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,can iphone pro have two physical sim cards in yes in hongkong variant
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,good option good
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,was convinced that you tagged photos incorrectly pro as pro max and vice versa but photos exif confirm you were right thats unbelievable that crop from is significantly better than optical in comparison the optical one in pro is also much better that crop in pro max but this is not surprise upgrade from to in pro max does not make any sense bad news is that pro is expected with instead of which is bad news unless they improve that tele lens
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,iphone has shitty battery life have one and the battery last two days the pro max the battery its way better but dont like the size
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,not really for the battery size its actually quite good maybe that award goes to more iphone has shitty battery life
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,samsung galaxy android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,battery backup is really bad good not buy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,sony limits the performance of its smartphones to get better battery results just look at the mark performance tests
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,know they havent reviewed the pixel pro but they didnt even mention that as the alternative yeah coz the pixel wasnt even announced when the iphone came out why would they put that as an alternative
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,are there any heating issues if tested
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,im not focus on gaming but if bought the top phone of the market the phone at least have more why is the phones fault if the game is badly optimized some games run better on ios while others run better on android its like complaining about the rain when you leave house without an umbrella if something is important do some research first also you should be able to return the phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,why would you buy iphone if your primary focus is gaming you know there are ac more im not focus on gaming but if bought the top phone of the market the phone at least have to handle the games and if they announce that the phone will handle ps games have to handle games in app store for sure
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,you realize youre pixel peeping mp processed jpgs and not full size images have yo more yep and the regular is still resolving more details
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,in an ideal world your flagship phone costing over would not require daily charge or ha more if you use your phone for calls and texts only with no internet traffic im sure you can go multiple days on charge unfortunately we cant do that and compromises have to be made there isnt single phone worth buying that can go multiple days on charge complaining about single brand is pointless
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,top phone with the worst battery life award not really for the battery size its actually quite good maybe that award goes to xiaomis
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,if the new cpu increases and efficiencies are to be believed how is it possible there is no benefit what crock
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,must say was surprised by the battery time on the new iphone pro my friend got one and more to be fair both your mi ultra aswell as the pro have awful battery life years old phone being on par is not very impressive
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple still doing something with colors like its not about warm colors but some kind of more probably the huesaturation theyre using on their official product shots natural titanium is silver not bronzy at all white titanium is light silver black is dark silver blue is blueblack theyre actually not all that different
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,since most phones require daily charge and you have magsafe batteries as an option what more in an ideal world your flagship phone costing over would not require daily charge or have you slap power bank to its back adding bulk weight and cost
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,all chips below nm are consuming more power yet the fabs do not recognize need to sell and more use mah
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,so you will never buy new flagship phone goes without saying
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,iphones are actually some of the best in terms of web browsing and video playback and some of the worst for talk times relative to battery size also standby times and talk times are highly variable from location to location and signal quality since talk times matter the least for most people the actual battery life is pretty good
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple seem to be getting left behind in terms of battery life
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apples can spend billion on acquiring distribution rights httpswwwgsmarenacomap more all chips below nm are consuming more power yet the fabs do not recognize need to sell and charge more as new things pushing electrons in small silicone is harder and the loss in heat dissipation is increasing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple iphone pro bought this phone which is the best phone of the time the top processo more top phone with the worst battery life award
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,bad battery life and still getting good score rigged review
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,camera config
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,no sd card slot no mm audio jack no fm radio no irblaster no ips display panel recyc more then you will never be able to find flagship phone that matches not even sony
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,endurance rating pixel hrs with the widely bashed tensor
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,without mentioning the overheating problem this review is not valid the software fix will sur more its not that widespread and seems to be triggered more by third party apps
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,mp at mm and mp at mm actually do not have same fov also exposure is different bet more the exposure seems to be almost identical to me and the field of view is arguably the same between mp and mp shots
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,mean it beats the and pm beats the su both in browsing web and video playback let more samsucks sucks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,well no because the lenght is much higher while the width is lower xperia cm iphone cm area you gain in height you lose way more in width
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,gsmarena spammed gsmarena with bunch of iphones
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,but the phone still doesnt fold im never going back to slab phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,not saying its widespread but it is real issue for some to the point where apple ac more oh yeah im not denying it happens but it seems to be in certain conditions not normally used just my thoughts
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,no mention because they didnt experience any neither have or others who posted here not saying its widespread but it is real issue for some to the point where apple acknowledged it no less
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,honestly its already quite decent battery life for the battery size just take look more apples can spend billion on acquiring distribution rights httpswwwgsmarenacomappleiphoneproreviewpphp httpswwwgsmarenacomappleiphoneproreviewpphp httpswwwgsmarenacomappleiphoneproreviewpphp httpswwwgsmarenacomappleiphoneproreviewpphp httpswwwgsmarenacomappleiphonepromaxreviewpphp year endurance iphone iteration battery endurance battery endurance battery endurance battery endurance battery endurance iphone liion mah iphone iphone liion mah iphone in years mah or increase over iphone from mah to mah mah or just to stay in the same spot this is apples deputy flagship or or eur write the emperors new clothes but unless ai makes vast improvements fembots or android is better bet and spending less than entering an apple store and asking for the iphone pro sic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,no mention of the overheating issue in the verdict this is concern that is still not re more no mention because they didnt experience any neither have or others who posted here
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,given an nm chip and other available technological advancements to improve efficiency such more mean it beats the and pm beats the su both in browsing web and video playback lets not pretend and the main use case of modern smartphone is phone calls
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,his this even honestly its already quite decent battery life for the battery size just take look at redmi note pro mah battery and endurance rating they had one job
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,is smaller than and xperia has mah iphone does not well no because the lenght is much higher while the width is lower
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,xperia flagship endurance rating same screen size xperia even reaches more is smaller than and xperia has mah iphone does not
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,so actually iphone benefits left are os support they are way better than any android or even pixel can offer video capturing wide ecosystem this is sad that innovations stopped
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,its waste of money on apple fashion conformists toys
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,to about in day with normal use thats not too bad
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,rip battery with all that thickness battery capacity still too small
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,terrible battery for being pro badge
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,charged the pro max sunday night and it was at tuesday evening with moderate use won more to about in day with normal use
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,nope small patterns are clearly less defined on the pro and the regular isnt suffer more you realize youre pixel peeping mp processed jpgs and not full size images have you tried applying usm on the pro images
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,they are much worser than all others worser
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,its more sharpness applied on the nonpro models nothing more nothing less otoh it more nope small patterns are clearly less defined on the pro and the regular isnt suffering from any more sharpening halo artifacts than the pro does more sharpening would also mean more visible noise but in thia case the pro seems to be suffering from it more than the regular model does
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,didnt got very hot during benchmarks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,its exquisite and now lighter design now but you need massive case to protect this chea more its funny that you managed to precisely quantify glass quality based on random accidents or uncontrolled drops
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,its hilarious to see that the iphone pro falls behind the regular iphone in mp more its more sharpness applied on the nonpro models nothing more nothing less otoh its something that once applied you cant take it back
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,when will salty androidnerds like you realise that iphone users dont care about your bab more move to iphone after android every years and lastly windows phone after they stop supporting know lot crazy futuristic transformers spec android offer and also lot people recommend me just getting android end up go for iphone to try until now never care about crazy spec anymore iphone is more to user experience instead of futuristic light speed spec android is cool but prefer something easy to use and work straight away so iphone is for me also wish android could focus on user experience back on topic new iphone seems good since already upgrade from to might skip this one for another year later
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the only iphone ever owned was the iphone and hated it very much still dont see anything special about these expensive bricks nokia from with symbian os is still much more advanced software wise
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,titanium frame is not durable as iphone proa lot of complaints from many peoples pro is better option
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,kind of had feeling the nonmax pro is the more problematic one with overheating notice how more smaller phones are more prone to get hotter when using same soc sony tab had no issues with sd because its giant body unlike all phones with that chip
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,phone is phone is phone they all have cameras play music and connect to the internet more when will salty androidnerds like you realise that iphone users dont care about your babbling about specs specs schpecs if you love your android phone you shouldnt be rage commenting in an iphone review article maybe youre the reason why android phones are treated inferior and why they dont receive as much attention as iphones you guys boost engagement of iphone articles with dumb nerdcomments
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,deleted post kind of had feeling the nonmax pro is the more problematic one with overheating notice how this review did not at all mention what level of heat they experienced with this phone in the performance or verdict section when they were very explicit about not experiencing overheating even with effort on the pro max review
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,limiting the telephoto to just the max feels arbitrary samsung mm fo more they are much worser than all others
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,rating for poco pro saga hell no
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,disappointing battery life looks like due to porr call and especially stand by performance which is really bad sign for those who dont use their phone lot and hope for solid battery time unfortunately this not the case here as with the poor stand by performance your battery charge will be drained even if you dont use your phone lot shame on apple for not being able to nail stand by performance even after so many years
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,cannot believe iphone cameras are comfortably ahead of xperia in terms of detail rendition impressive
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,it feels like something was omitted from this review
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,dont fully get their battery endurance tests too the web browsing video tests are gr more some phones have over of talk time and huge standby overall score is higher even if internetvideo are lower
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,all them have low talk time and below average standby
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,im kinda sick of those overly big and heavy phones this is the first top of the line ip more dont fully get their battery endurance tests too the web browsing video tests are great but at the same time overall endurance is just hours which is pathetic for such very expensive phone and the review doesnt say that its really bad mean its comparable to galaxy which has an hours endurance and was bashed everywhere for it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,meh next
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,why are the colors literally western mens clothing laughed out so loud reading your comment
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,if you use the hardware whilst charging it will get warmer all phones do that my brother
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,my pro with ios version is getting hotter while playing the phone or when charging more if you use the hardware whilst charging it will get warmer
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,pro best
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,you know its generally android phone vs apple phone rage but personally want the best of both worlds this pro series model is the best for me as its pretty new and take two main things into consideration size to be compact and weight to be light this is just perfect smaller than promax and models and more powerful than the anything coming before it including the regular model
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,prefer this over the pro any day the camera control button is useless as there is lockscreen shortcut that directly takes you to camera there is also controlcenter button favorite app bar these are easy shortcuts they also removed my favorite colour blue titanium and replaced it with gray black white and beige
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,after updating ios the standard titanium wallpaper on my iphone pro is gone its more yes have the same problem dont have them since ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,so weird that when turn on its private hotspot its wifi and bluetooth have to be turned on too so fcking annoying
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,bought it on and its very cuty phone ever
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the perfect iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,people using pro from long time can you tell me hows the battery good okay bad more to be honest im not very impressed because after months of using my battery life is with cycles and sometimes just with mobile data on and using some apps hours screen on from am to pm need to recharge my phone the camera its not that greatcoming from pro and regreting sometimes because the photos taken of the sheets are blurry even thought have the maximum settings set kfpspfpskfps not gonna lie the change is big from hz pro to pro but think thats why my battery go down this fast well we can add as well the apro processor but idk sorry for my english hope helped have nice day
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple iphone pro is an amazing device that truly feels premium with its lighter titanium design the pro chip delivers outstanding performance especially for gaming and heavy apps the cameras have also improved significantly particularly in lowlight conditions however feel the price is bit steep and expected better battery life overall if youre an apple fan and want the best this phone is definitely worth considering
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,me works hours per day me thought iphone to iphone would be sweet deal since it would sy more me waiting the phone for hours to update the the only issue had when got the phone plus forcing me to update to ios at first thought got scammed and the phone is brokenafter two hours got tired of waitinghad to reboot the phone twice before everything went fine
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,couldnt get the prodesert so got the pro on october st couldnt be more happyapart from the camera button dont think will miss that much tbh and like said in other post im not phone gamer or that much using camjust normal usage the battery life amazed me honestlysometimes it go two full days before need to recharge the phonebig thanks to payette forwards setting vid on youtubefrom the mini to pro was huge huge upgrade for mei think will stick with forever
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,greate amazing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,best in camera quality best display best performance decent zoom camera like this phone have it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,currently im using iphone pro but iphone pro gives better battery backup why did apple make the battery in the pro smaller than the
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple really messed up with the ios update while the phone transfers its better to start the more the way see it you got two phones total price euro one is brand new one is year old there is no way apple screwed so bad with the file transfer when in android you can practically do it while driving and the fact no one address it as serious issue is why avoid samsung and apple they will do everything to keep their little image high
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,anyone have idea for the new iphone cause do customize home screen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,hello guys have used this phone for couple of months its very good phone that has more nice battery what are smoking
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,have overheating problems with my pro it randomly overheats when im doing random lightwe more mixture of bad thermals and glass
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,kinda regret buying black looking how good looks white and natural titanium
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,want whatever you are smoking my pro works flawlessly scroll through gifs in google
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the general rule of thumb with apple iphones is that you never buy the base model because apple forgot to use letter pro superior models have their letter
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,will survive years with before had with gb and was about gb left the general rule of thumb with apple iphones is that you never buy the base model
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,is iphone pro support otg yes
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,im an android user and just bought this iphone pro yesterday just because want too try more bro if we talk about camera than phone and samsung have best cameras
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,even though the weight is reduced by still think it should be lighter at the same time it also seems that some are still not satisfied with the battery life personally would sacrifice some battery for lighter weight but because that is not the popular opinion it wont happen the pro is rumored to be slightly bigger despite smaller bezels because the screen will be larger than the amount of bezel reduction and the phone to be heavier thats compared to only heavier on the pro max possibly because of the inclusion of the tetraprism for the first time in the smaller pro its not good time to be someone who cares about the ergonomic properties of smartphones flat sides high weight big sizes maybe in the far future when there have been many advancements in displaymodemchipbattery technology there will be an iphone that is as thin as the new ipad pro and correspondingly much lighter id even be fine with bump to accommodate the usbc port like the galaxy alpha had if that means light and easy to use phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the new device is almost identical to last years model with minimal changes the design is beautiful but largely unchanged from the previous yearnew action button is coolbut didnt find any practical use for it camera is outstanding with bright photoseven in extremely dark areasone of the best ois it might be the bestim not sure how latest huawei is performing in that regard videos are super stable locked focus dont even wanna shake with high framerate and high bit rate the display made by samsung is one of the best on the market with hz refresh rate and support for billions of colors though the resolution is somewhat unusual while the performance isnt topnotch the pro chip manufactured using tsmcs nm process shows potential its important to note that tsmc rushed their nm process to gain an advantage over samsung similar to what samsung did two years ago as result the process is unfinished and unoptimized leading to overheating and throttling especially without proper cooling ios limits the chips maximum power to prevent overheating and enhances the overall experience the software is incredibly smooththe smoothest ive ever usedbut its very limited with barely any customization options lacking multitasking features and featuring confusing navigation and unnecessary actions to complete tasks it wastes your time and is only smooth and lagfree now after battery life is ok in my test battery achieve sot with mixed usage without gaming so its possible to achieve hours or even more charging is pain in the ass slowest ive ever experience slower than any android with wireless charging even worse reverse wireless charging is only usable with earbuds nothing else
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,adp iphone also has adp so how are we gonna compareknow if the audio quality impr more adp didnt change the max bit rate for audio it is the same in bluetooth versions and you gain an slight advantage by going to bluetooth le audio but your bluetooth headphones should also support le audio am not sure whether apple has added support for le audio
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,switched to this iphone recently and noticed theres no gsmarena app in app store will there ever be tho
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,what are talking about buddy used it intensively before returned it and just got the conclusion cant have longlasting phone with small screen and the latest software and soc theres no other way around it pro max might be way better than this
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,dont recommend buying this particular model get older models or just wait for the curr more buddyfalse info
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,and well if you want to get the series surely get the plus or pro max even base model lasts more than this piece of shit
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,is there way to set so this thing will always connect to mobile hotspot because its only connect when its screen is on and when its on standby mode its disconnected right away so annoying
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple is always good product apple ceo doing good job what im saying is if any thi more memory chip cant overheat its was crappy soc
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,oh man dont have to tell you the whole story why im buying it online but after have more why not watch youtube read online reviews or even gsmarenas review all shows the ui and accurate dimensions and weight of the phone give pro and cons and justification of to buy or not to buy without having to leave home you give reasons ui camera and weight not to your liking of all all can be evaluated with just online reviews no need to go for tedious buy and return waste delivery fees just does not make any logical sense unless it never happens or very bias personal evaluation that is not with the norm ie the online reviews differs from your personal views
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,why not just try in the shop no like just leave why buy just to try only trolls does that oh man dont have to tell you the whole story why im buying it online but after have it and use it just cant find any rational reason why its so expensive and why people willing to pay for it but at least if cant sell it back with minimum losses have an iphone with usbc port
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,how bad is the battery life on regular pro not bad at all gt to the end of the day with to battery with gwi fi and bt on
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,finally they put on an usbc port its not like galaxy came out in samsung year started using type but htc model htc got type
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,need compact phone options and effective price in my place pixel usd ipho more think you can go for even for the snapdragon is really good no lag at all and all the features the has after last update spend money on other stuff like traveling instead
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,hellothanks for all your devicesi used one iphone xs
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,its good device but very expensive being an elite brand
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,used the nokia pureview for years without screen protector and it never got scr more bro nokia is known for innovation hv my works fine but no app support
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,actually for the price apple should include screen and lens protectors for their high end phones
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,get reasonable screen protector iphone pro screen scratches easily
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the titanium doesnt really improve durability according to some tests seems like gimmick think when the standard iphone probably gets hz the pro model with its third camera lens will be only for show off otherwise the standard has optical zoom now since the and hopefully the ultrawide will be upgraded to macro in the future whats left then for the pro camera button that is rumored to be included with the pro the lidarscanner that nobody uses for ar and is only bit nice but barely noticeable with low light camera focusing thunderbolt that nobody uses on their phone either the bigger sensors whose images the postprocessing ruins anyway but the tradeoff is much bigger camera bump much more weight and price
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,does the color chips on the sides or on the camera part might wanna buy camera lens protector and phone case
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,sony have the hardware but their processing software is garbage the iphone specs is really good
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,endurance rating good to know this review has pretty much everything you need to know to avoid buying overpriced electronics they say that the phones shell is made of ti but we have several foodgrade titanium cookware and the entire set doesnt cost as much as this phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,same hardware design for past years os also same features and same big icon no improvements for past years come on apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,good phone worst os ever have an android phone samsung galaxy ultra but im fed up with android so bought the apple iphone pro max recently and im delighted with it its really beautiful and much lighter than the ultra its wish had tried an iphone years ago would of stopped buying samsung galaxy ultra phones im an apple buyer from now on
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,for camera phone buy sony even some of iphone samsung google pixel using sony censor more sony have the hardware but their processing software is garbage
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,suggested that the battery capacity be increased and the phone size be inches for the pr more pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,those colors are quite letdown in my opinion they really thought replacing black silver and gold with dark grey and two shades of beige was good idea
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,rom read only memory is different from hard drivestoragessd and soldered ramssd is reall more apple is always good product apple ceo doing good job what im saying is if any thing happened to the memory chip or storage chip over heat or malfuntion then we need to replace entire system board so system board price is higher than one single ram or storage price some apples spare parts are very difficult to received on time out of stock or delay for delivery
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,yay the best camera phone award from mkbhd lets goo
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,why apple make apple laptop for inbuilt ram and rom if you make the apple laptop with removab more rom read only memory is different from hard drivestoragessd and soldered ramssd is really no longer an apple thing as so many manufacturers are doing the same nowadays for thinner form factors and better performance yes soldered ram yields far better performance due to less physical distance to the cpu and not being bottlenecked by the sodimm interface while soldering the ssd is more like an appearance concern only id say apple should charge less for the upgrade as these components are relatively cheap now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,ios file management is still frustatingsave folder from cloud or copy folder from usb still more yea file management in ios is hellso stupidly complicated still wondering how people get along with that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,if you need camera phone than go for phone or samsung phones only these companies have goo more the best cameras are on pixel phones the most stable and the best performance os on ios most complete os samsung oneui with the desktop mode
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,but huawei is scam company and doesnt produce as good camera as iphones iphones is co more if you need camera phone than go for phone or samsung phones only these companies have good camera phones
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,connect iphonepm with pc by itunes you can only transfer data less then mbs mister connect any smartphone to pc and transfert photos with videos check transfert speed never did it you will see max mbs try
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,iphones specs are high class but the batt are low class they should do something about it yet its battery active score beats phones like the galaxy so what does it matter if their battery is smaller but the device is more efficient they still beat their competition in battery life
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,so does that mean you have to have tip rop condition too theyd have to check the conditions too to make sure if it has no scratches on all sides im not very sure because havent own an iphone for long time
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,depends on iphone model and storage variant so does that mean you have to have tip rop condition too
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,how much do they pay in return is it half the price or below depends on iphone model and storage variant
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,check the below youtube video for durability test jerryrigeverything last more but huawei is scam company and doesnt produce as good camera as iphones iphones is consistent with its performance all around
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,make sure if your iphone is eligible for trade in like no scratches and cracks just like in more how much do they pay in return is it half the price or below
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,can even pcs emulate the ps afaik this iphone can even run ps games youve probably been staying in your parents basement thinking that pcs cant emulate ps well guess what its working fluidly on my ryzen xd paired with nvidia rtx can even emulate switch games aswell ps wc is still buggy due to beta emulator your so called iphone can run ps looks to be only streaming not actual game on it even their macbooks wc is their desktop line barely have any emulation support waste of time due to miniscule userbase locked down expensive if you want portable emulation machine then theres steamdeck or others like aya neo gpd etc that comes with amd ryzen or even intel that not only emulates but plays pc games aswell
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,can it emulate ps if it does not then its just another tiktok machine can even pcs emulate the ps afaik this iphone can even run ps games
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,processor not big difference from bionic chip
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,no issues just to clarify iphone pro is almost same as the last year model but with new ti more check the below youtube video for durability test jerryrigeverything last years same hardware design and same software ios huawei mate pro mate are leading the global market in asia
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,sorry thought you were talking about the pro max no issues just to clarify iphone pro is almost same as the last year model but with new titanium frame and type and less weight
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,check again iphone pro max have not iphone pro sorry thought you were talking about the pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,but battery life is not good and it have still the same camera as its predecessor so do more it has new camera
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,iphone pro is actually the best phone you can buy right now pro chip is so good it litera more but battery life is not good and it have still the same camera as its predecessor so dont buy the pro this year go for iphone pro next year and you will thank me later
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,stay on ios dont upgrade if you want to possibly get trollstore and install thirdparty apps
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,whats the problem with upgrading to gb beats me certainly not price gigabytes are quite literally pennies on the dollar an extra is nothing theres reason xiaomi can sells phones like the ultra with terabyte of storage for less than half the price of the base model of this while barely making any sacrifices
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple has managed to fix the overheating issues of this phone leaving one less reason to not get this httpsseamashablecomtechiphoneoverheatingfixthermalimagingrevealswhetheriosupdateworked search for yourself
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,nm cpu is better than nm cpu nm is less heating issue we like the display size bcz its very easy to use with one hand please continue this display size
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,gig base model on pro model when its almost lmao whats the problem with upgrading to gb
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,same with google spyapple spy yes google is spying after their special spying tool is chrome and android os but apple and huawei is best for privacy and security so many peoples are saying like that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,nonsense ive had macbook pro for while now and not only it is way cooler than my more can play crisis on the mac fps
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,no because it is chinese phone it will never be private same with google spyapple spy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,jibon oct iphone is far better than pro series the battery of pro is just ridiculous the three more of these comments are made by people that havent used an iphone single day zero moderation
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,huawei mate pro is best for privacy and security no because it is chinese phone it will never be private
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,tb ram doubt it to be honest tb is storage not ram ram is gb iphones need less ram than android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apple is famous for heating issue like their laptops no cooling fan also nonsense ive had macbook pro for while now and not only it is way cooler than my previous pc notebooks yoga thinkpad etc it is way more performant to comparable notebooks could buy today and it is very silent sorry need to call this
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,iv had macbook for years never had any issue your post is completely baseless old is gold
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,why baseless
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,you will wait over an hour for you awesome iphone to eventually charge while android users are more we do not like android it does not offer privacy and the operation system is awful
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,update will be out soon and it will be fixed had same issue for week or two with pro apple is famous for heating issue like their laptops no cooling fan also
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,very terrible phone and worse build quality phone getting heat quickly iphone pro is muc more update will be out soon and it will be fixed had same issue for week or two with pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,saw it at bestbuy and it is very tick at camera lenses area it is hideous
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,mate not in years will phone cameras compete with professional dslrsmirrorless came more true besides the small lenses of the phone which do not allow to collect many photons the grip in hands of such phones is big problem you still need to use the hands to make pictures on the go
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,those reviewers got free review units do you think theyre going to talk bad about it more thats not how it works buddy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,people are reporting heating issue
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,apparently not check techdroider or mrwhosetheboss video on yt mrwhoknowsnothing dont tell you anything he doesnt really know anything tech the pro is more efficient with the same clock speed as and it draws less power the issue is apple pushes the clock speed even higher so they can advertise larger improvement in performance thus higher power draw if the or were pushed as much they would draw more power than the pro apple couldve fixed it by not pushing the clock speed so high but then the performance improvement wont be that large and the keynote wouldnt be too exciting marketing wins in the end
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,really imagine you hire photographer for your wedding who charge you few thousands for more when you hire photographer do you hire the person or just the gadgets wouldnt care what tools photographer use as long as the result is what paid for
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,what is bad is tha the most important tech rewiers does not even talk about it what bad ti more those reviewers got free review units do you think theyre going to talk bad about it if they did they wont get review unit anymore and their youtube channel die
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,biggest piece of apple sht to date so much remorse and returning to the rotten apple store more what is bad is tha the most important tech rewiers does not even talk about it what bad time for the avg consumer
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,iphone pro or pro which is good is pro worth for that extra money youre getting usbc an upgrade from the lightning port much better chipset and considerably much lighter body than pro bezels are thinner its camera has been upgraded too so if you dont want those features iphone pro is definitely best and much better than iphone other than the fact that it lacks usbc though as its discontinued itll be harder to get brandnew one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,if you read pro is more efficient thus use less power over time so if you need cons more apparently not check techdroider or mrwhosetheboss video on yt
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,my hunch was right all along about the battery life mah of this phone after checking some battery tests can conclude among these series this has the poorest battery it showed that pro chip is really powerful but not efficient enough to prolong the battery so expect this phone to heat up when youre doing photography or gaming because it has hz refresh rate it does eat up the battery fast than the iphone series however it might actually last longer if you toggle the settings to hz instead so thats that folks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,most likely you never used apple device if you claim such thing have iphone with gb more to be fair the photos will be significantly larger now that the default resolution was increased to mpx and it can go up to mpx also have an iphone with gb of storage but this time ill go with the gb version as coincidence also happen to have pictures to be exact just gb of free storage left though
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,gb is absolutely not worth it you are gonna run out of storage in year most likely you never used apple device if you claim such thing have iphone with gb storage bought it years ago and used up only about of storage space have about photos and about videos inside use icloud for which pay per month
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the usb standard in iphone pro pro max is usb gen gbps as mentioned in there official website and that in samsung sss ultra is usb gen gbps also mentioned in there official website so request you to kindly update the specifications of the above mentioned smartphones along with data transfer speeds so that it will help smartphone buyers and tech enthusiasts lot
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,mah battery seriously whats wrong with apple fans nothing they last all day my pixel pro dies in the afternoon around pm my wifes pro goes for hours past it capacity doesnt matter so much when the stamina is strong
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,yes it does support slovakian slovakian is not the same thing with slovenian slovenia is country slovakia is another country and the language is different
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,you charge to in minutes and spoil your phone in minutes too incorrect httpswwwcnetcomtechmobiledoesfastchargingaffectbatterylifephonebatteryquestionsanswered
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the pro battery capacity kinda rubs me off bit compared to other models which has the low more if you read pro is more efficient thus use less power over time so if you need constant high processing then the pro will last longer however if using less processing task then the non pro should last longer not by much on top of that the display on the pro will help save more battery due to the variable refresh rate but subjective on what you use like the aod
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,please anwser me is it possible to have menu in slovenian language thank you yes
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,shooting prores these gb will go away quickly yeah sure but spend more to get the next tier you settle for the minimum to save but eventually youd think you need more space as it builds up
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the listed capacities are mah for the iphone mah for the iphone plus more the pro battery capacity kinda rubs me off bit compared to other models which has the lowest mah wonder how that could last with the power of pro is that something similar to iphone pro battery as well
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,sep you dont need gb ram is enough its gimmick too have this much the irony gb is nothing phone from has the same amount gb is good update and good for future proofing the phone further also this increase helps with the larger console ports that they bringing to the iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,height and width of this with thickness of iphone and slightly lighter weight than iphone as iphone that would still not be amazing for someone like me who likes smaller phones but it would be quite acceptable
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,correction the best iphone ever not the best smartphone there is never the best smartphone either each have their own strengths
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,correct in minutes is slower than in minutes and you pay more for such more you charge to in minutes and spoil your phone in minutes too
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,in mins pretty fast that aint quick going by todays standard it still will be around minutes for full chargein the android world thats slow
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the dark businesscolors are bit depressing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,as person who had never used iphone before its pretty attractive the usbc port is more ive been using samsung phones for over decade now upto sthey all have common annoying pbthe phone gets slow whenever the memory is almost full so decided to switch to iphone pro this timelets see how it goes
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,maintaining consistent design for many years is essential to preserve companys reput more exactly this is what kids dont understand
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,better to switch ultra

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,dont waste money on pro use pro there are not major difference
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the price in indonesia was so insane
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,this phones price in indonesia was
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,increase in multicore performance over previous generation lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,what is navic mentioned along with gps glonass etc is this new tech navic this is bharat indian satellite system
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,best phone out there by far you will wait over an hour for you awesome iphone to eventually charge while android users are already using their phones at full battery richer than you
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,imagine in year you can get your phone charged to in mins but no apple wants you to pay more to get phone charged to in mins in year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,it must be inch in size camera mp rear front camera mp and mm thikness is may be better
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,never saw so much hate over new iphone series its crazy thats android people for you
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,for euro that has gtx like gpu processor with software issues are expensive like the hell
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,of course its apple the rest will follow next year words can come true sometimes hope that did not happen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the best smartphone ever correction the best iphone ever not the best smartphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,so batteries are sold separately now of course its apple the rest will follow next year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,thats accessories need to buy it together with charger so batteries are sold separately now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,finally usb for apple users
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,no bionic moniker this time its pro now lol im guessing they are following the socs naming convention so would expect nonpro maybe for the iphone se and base ipad later in the future
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,please tell me if usb typec support otg from what ive heard and read it will be similar to the ipad where you can attach usb sticks or hard drives via the usbc port
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,did pro gb support prores now

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,when they put fingerprint biometric on their supreme iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,very slow battery charging time pretty sad for such an innovative company apple isnt known as innovative since steve is no longer with us it is now trendsetter company
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,lol gb
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,batery capacity
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,samsung galaxy is both better in specs and cheaper only advantage is probably the ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,blah blah was going to go back using ipad pri and iphone pro nah same old no major changes flogging dead horse for grand plus not me this is my reply to apple selling my old devices staying in the samsung club etc
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,love it the design is amazing thinner bezels titanium frame usb customizable button bet you dont see that in any other phone now if youll excuse me have to go auction my kidney liver and spleen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,like its predecessor
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,main camera data is not ok sensor is bigger then in iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,grateful for the type
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,its sucks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,gb wasnt pro and max at gb as standard both the pro and pro max were gb standard last year same deal here though the pro max has gone up to gb standard along with price hike
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,same phone different year thanks apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro,the only real change is the chipset and the materials
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,my first and last iphone honestly dont know how to begin my frustrations being more you simply dont know how to use an iphone and you are not ready to learn you should not expect an iphone to be exactly like an android dont have single issue with my iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,great phone not great battery life wish it had another ma then the phone would be too expensive and the charging would take to long and they wuld need to redesign the entire case to fit the battery
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,phone of the century by far its not
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,look for reviews of cameras panorama modes especially if their ultrawide can do sweep panor more wait for iphone pro and pro max theyre getting new one mp
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,worst phone ever built months after buying today my phone is not charging after taking to th more thats not the phones fault
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no overheating for me yes it gets warm but overheating would mean system errors and messages more lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how can grams phones does not have battery its not just about the battery size but more about how power efficient the chipset is if you compare samsungs ultra chipet gen to pro the iphones chipset are far more power efficient than samsungs chipset which means that iphones dont need battery still the battery on iphone and samsung are on par in battery life even tho samsung have bigger battery
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yes lot of heating this phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,overheating yes im seriously having overheating problem with my iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for any current owners have you noticed any issues skipped frames jerky video overheating more overheating yes
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone pros easily to use good camera best for women slightly improved battery life comp more its usb not type dont exist fruit
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wish have that phone galaxy grand
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,love it wish have that phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the only downside think is the screencomparing it side by side when playing pubgi found th more turn off the auto brightness mode
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im loving the iphone pro max each day lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why no mp photo of the front of vitosha hall apple requested that you do not show this that seems to be tendency in your reviews when shooting any photos using the cameras native resolution no longer included are the front photos of vitosha hall with those pesky window shades with round holes that are so revealing that upscaling is used to fake the native resolution upscaling is nothing new and no need to hide that the phone makers are using it the first phone owned that did this was back in when got the imobile made by the thai company samart typical feature phone with an amazing sonyproduced mp ccd camera with xenon flash two aperture sizes mechanical shutter and shutter speeds down to seconds seconds with ev it was capable of really amazing photos one feature have not seen since is slow sync flash slow shutter giving blurry movement in photos with one instant frozen by the xenon flash but for marketing purposes it did also offer an mp mode which was just mp photos upscaled to mp
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,which photographic style did you guys use on the photos probably the default one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,is slow oo its comparatively slow but for of people its more than more yes is slow my phone is
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,performed test on gsmarenas samples and concluded that the mp images in iphone more meh
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why gsmarena iphone reviews are always longer than normal
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,every iphone review of gsma proclaims that they offer most accurate colour representation from more yeah thats just not true from gsm or any other reviewer iphone used to go for colour accuracy but now just like pixel and scamsung they overprocess and saturate colours like everyone else and its hella annoying af
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so it gets but it still has slow charging worse battery than the other max phones worse more is slow oo its comparatively slow but for of people its more than quick enough the heat and throttling have been resolved with an update usb brings lot to the table and like it or not previous iphones didnt have it but they were the first to get charging solution with reversable input before android finally got its act together and adopted usb or does that not fit into your narrative of hating apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,could you please compare it with xiaomi ultra mate what do you take the compare tool for httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,both ultra and iphone pro max excel in battery longevity since you are okay for bo more yup my so far so good just the battery
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,just asking suggestion using ultra for now should change to iphone pro max or more both ultra and iphone pro max excel in battery longevity since you are okay for both these are okay in my opinion your ultra stills good and would suggest you wait for the ultra for better using experience
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not the back glass they arent and pixel pro didnt even break on multiple drops im not talking about drop tests it doesnt matter what matters more is for how many years you can squeeze the life out of your phone before getting new one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphones are simply very durable the iphone plus is still in use and ive used my ipho more not the back glass they arent and pixel pro didnt even break on multiple drops
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its their modems that kills them for me their mid tier socs are acceptable but the loss of more nope youre wrong and my pixel pro picks up great signal it was only pro that was bad
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,they are not half day battery devices my pro lasts the day fine
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the bottom picture rd is that the natural or white titanium
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wait and see what google offer pixel phones are underrated here because they dont use more they are not half day battery devices
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,just like any other chipset the throttles its gpu down to so it can keep the phone from overheating during extensive hourlong gpu stress testing are you serious did the gen and throttles its gpu down to too why sugar coat it its hot soc is much better choice for those looking for phone or upgrade aka ippm
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,please note on other benchmarks or geekbenchantutu there is big drop in performance following update tested with wild life unlimited and solar bay unlimited
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,am wondering if the display is true bit panel or bit
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,just tried the main camera of the pro max which should have the same main camera as the pro and am shocked about the minimum focus distance if you dont want to digitally zoom with the ultra wide angle camera the minimum focus distance of the main camera is maybe approximately cm huge difference in comparison to other phones like pixel pro pixel pro iphone mini ultra etc think never used phone camera with such high minimum focus distance for the main camera
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its os is not clockwork it has some really nesty bugs for instance you cant send the video over viber or telegram and be sure it will be sent if viber or telegram is not in front and this is not low battery mode could not use pro max with cozoy takt pro because it loosed audio sync and glitched and so on
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lmao the note ultra has an aluminum frame this phones cameras are covered in protective more aluminium used on the cheaper iphone cool story bro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,another apple joke the lenses outside the frailty the colors titanium wow note more lmao the note ultra has an aluminum frame this phones cameras are covered in protective glass just like all phones
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,which one to get the su or the pro max wait and see what google offer pixel phones are underrated here because they dont use the fastest cpus on the market
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,now that the smartphones are near perfect and new upgrades look useless they should just launch new phone after every years this will give them chance to build better device and more people will be inclined towards the new upgrade
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,once iphone will have clean clear screen without any notched or some maldives or bora bo more agree like what sony did for the market
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,we have seen enough reviews if the sultra is just bit better than suthen it will dismantle this promax its up to samsung now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,at store compared the pro max camera with my pro at approximately mm and used more which phone is the best in your opinion in terms of camera quality
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,overheating issues battery expands in result of this rear glass shatters from st drop they must be nuts all the pros the ihpones over android are now gone rock solid strong not overheating not battery exapnsions
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hard to believe with software update the thermal conductivity of titanium solves the problem
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,basic photos are three times better than those taken with the pro max and everyone imcluding the article seems to ignore this how come
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thank you we are aware of this and that is why we start our tests after couple of cycles more you should post the standby time results for all reviews once you do the revamped battery tests
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton oct but the and are the best phones with battery life dont think thats the case the is the fix for the
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,now it seems like on every new redesign apple intentionally set the battery life to be worse more but the and are the best phones with battery life dont think thats the case
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,good stuff something id like to point for battery tests on android devices is the need more thank you we are aware of this and that is why we start our tests after couple of cycles this applies to the charging test too
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,even so and taking out the ultra which is good phone this is the best so far the pixel pro is missing dont know if mororla will release something else or sony the vivo is coming
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it is downloaded but we are working right now on completely revamping our battery life test more good stuff something id like to point for battery tests on android devices is the need for them to optimize properly in the few days of usage they usually required to be on idle and charging overnight after the usual setup for apps to optimize in the background you can read some info about the technicals behind it here httpssourceandroidcomdocscoreruntimejitcompiler say this because this affects the standby drain lot thus lowering your scores in many phones that havent been optimized properly
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its best cellular phone but will wait for fps camera on iphone thanks hahaha it will arrive yrs from now since its iphone we are talking about
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,please for the battery life do guys stream the video or its already downloaded thanks it is downloaded but we are working right now on completely revamping our battery life test and the new one will include video streaming and new better web browsing test with touch simulation every few seconds so it can stay relevant with the new displays with dynamic refresh rates we will launch it soon and we are going to test again many of the most recent phones weve reviewed since marchapril
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you are welcome and thank you too for the suggestion have recently experienced some aw more please for the battery life do guys stream the video or its already downloaded thanks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,look you had quoted apples generic description from gheir product page marketing page more the only reason for mp output in all focal lengths is distraction from the fact that it is basically cropping and resizing as gsmarena demonstrated and the anonymous writer had pointed out see that you are mixing up two topics into one was calling out the anonymous user for straight up making up nonsense that the mp image at mm is upscaled from mp which is simply not true if you look at the official description and the actual results itself because the mp photos from iphone looks nowhere near as detailed as the default mp shots what gsmarena has pointed out is the fact that theres no difference in the level of details captured by the camera apps mm mode mm and mm modes respectively this is pretty obvious because in mm modes the camera is simply cropping from the original mp image and resizing the final image to mp while its nice that they provide users multiple default wide angle field of view options they were undeniably misleading people by presenting these crop settings as two independent lenses which makes absolutely no sense the idea of digital teleconverter isnt new premium prime lens cameras from leica and fujifilm have had that for years and sony has had apsc crop mode on its full frame bodies since forever however apple was implying that using the crop settings somehow does not lead to image quality degradation and they totally deserve to be called out for that tldr the anonymous user lied so pointed that out apple did mislead the audience in the presentation but thats not the topic that the anonymous user was discussing in the first place
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,people here make fun of exynos being such powerfull heating beast and underperforming anyway own pro max and another banned phone both really good phones was so impressed by pro max that tought finally the day has come this is the year will make the change from pm to pm but no thanks after saw jerryrig the titanium marketing crap was impressive the heating issue was another cherry on the cake damn have to wait another year maybe next year will replace my pm thought pm will be something extraordinary but after some days it has become something unextraordinary for me atleast nice job apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why are mobiles using zoom settings for portaits or gives best dslr focal length more what are you talking about there is no such thing as dslr focal length
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why usb cable not usb or
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if the back glass cracking easily is dealbreaker for you then you must be high on drugs just put on case and even if you sit on it it wont break you wont purposely bend it either would you unless youre jerryrigeverything
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,equivalent of lenses starting at ultra wide these are apple more look you had quoted apples generic description from gheir product page marketing page as source and said they would not get away with it if what they say were not true but what you had quoted applies to every other manufacturers too the whole output is in all smartphones combination of multiple images and algorithms the difference is apple is pretending they were doindg something special while the only reason for mp output in all focal lengths is distraction from the fact that it is basically cropping and resizing as gsmarena demonstrated and the anonymous writer had pointed out btw why not mp or mp ill tell you mp is the output you get by the lens out of the box without resizing if apple was honest they would have simply saved mp in case of which they still allow mp in case of and mp in case of and just save them in hiec format like all others have been doing too edit they alost pretended that saving in hiec format was something new apples behaviour is simply disgusting and needs to be pounted out
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,stars for phone you cant replace any parts on yourself without the software blocking you out of features like the camera back glass is replaceable this time but it breaks way more frequently classic apple move
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,last year we got on our pro max and ios this year we decided to test it again on ios and we got now this is interesting wonder if it has got to do with ios optimization
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple cheapened out by removing the support panel for the back glass thus making it more fragile than previous iphones this is just sad for such an expensive phone and trillion dollar company yet cutting corners in every possible way
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,is it the same sourxe that said iphones with ultra wide main and zoom would offer zoom more equivalent of lenses starting at ultra wide these are apples marketing jargons and they are not straight up lying to you about it even though still extremely misleading and obviously they should never have marketed it like they did regarding the mp output theres nothing misleading about simply saying combining the best pixels from superhighresolution image with another thats optimised for light capture it means exactly what it means full resolution output is being combined with pixelbinned output and the level of detail you get from such mp photos is exactly what you would expect from it that is more detailed than the mp shot but less so than mp shot from the same camera regardless of how you upscale the mp shot taken at mm to mp you would never match the detail level of the default mp shot this is nothing to do with whatever the pseudo mm focal length that apple is trying to sell you by the way
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,from apples own product page on iphone pro the new photonic engine combines more is it the same sourxe that said iphones with ultra wide main and zoom would offer zoomstarting at ultra wide is it the same product page that says iphone pro max would offer the equivalent of lenses the anonymous writers message is correct even if simplified all those pseudo lenses are invented only to pretend to have something new just look at the experiment described by gsmarena in the text it actually proves that the anonymous writer is correct and you proves that apple can easily fool people it is absolutely unnecessary to introduce mp pictures that at the end are nothing but resized pictures
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thanks dude yeah like you im happy that can switch back and forth between android and io more ive stuck with android ever since picked the dell streak in because it was the only phone could use with big enough screen to handle my coordination difficulties kind of hilarious now in this phablet era and my phone sizes have since varied quite bit but ive basically remained on this side of the walled garden through inertia if the range dumped exynos on me then id probably have seriously considered this iphone generation or an older one refurbished but the lightning cable would have been barrier then instead samsung stepped up with global snapdragon and finally have legit upgrade path from my fe and if that phone didnt exist id have likely given apple very long look in too now that switching is easier than it was crossshopping apple with android is legit move im going of some variety but samsung legitimately earned this one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,overall iphone photos are very true to life its one reason why like iphone photos so more disagree iphone has tendency to oversaturate highlights blue light sources are completely crushed in lowlightindoor light skin turning orange when the sun is directly shining onto it crush shadows in high contrast scenes and put fairly noticeable yellowgreen tint on pretty much every single photo find apples tonemapping to be so offensively bad to the point that turn it off and use adobes default colour profile whenever edit proraw not that take many photos with my iphone pro to begin with
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for phone that blocks repairs via software no thanks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,there isnt discernible difference between apples mm shot and our simple cropandupscale its not simple crop and upscale adobes preserve details uses neural network this was described by adobe several years ago
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,good summary one of the reasons why switched from pixel pro to this phone was battery life more thanks dude yeah like you im happy that can switch back and forth between android and ios at will in fact when this pro max was feeling warm during set up and restore which didnt think anything of at first its quite normal when doing set up after all but then all this noise about over heating started blowing up sorry for the pun and in moment of panic ordered an ultra for pick up from store thought well if this thing does have some kind of defect ill simply return it and maybe take the opportunity to jump back over to android for while well the pro max has calmed down now everything is properly set up and restored and works as expected but still have week to return if it does start going nuclear for whatever reason and still have that ultra on order going back to android is my current plan but only because my own personnel preference slightly puts ios ahead doesnt mean dont have great appreciation for android though guess we are lucky we are not like those people say they cannot use one or the other
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,from my own experience having now used this device for week is that the performance is fine more good summary one of the reasons why switched from pixel pro to this phone was battery life and it really doesnt disappoint im half and half between anrdroid and ios anyway as love both do prefer vanilla android to ios though its sad that some people are so tribal about their choice of smartphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what an absolute joke the gaming tests are call of duty and especially pokemon go are not even barely demanding try to play genshin impact at ultra for long periods of time and then lets talk apple are claiming latest aaa games will be playable and here gsma are testing this hardware with year old cod game and pokemon go like kids which is absolutely hilarious
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lol talk time thats terrible battery life even talking will drain the battery quickly and thats still mobile network usage which means browsing through ggg will drain it in no time who cares about good wifi endurance
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,we spared nearly half page on the subject and spent two days exclusively testing for this th more ive had the pro max for few days now and its not overheated once is it happening when charging my pixel pro was toasty sometimes when charging on samsung charger
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,funny how people would call iphones the best phone for photography the over sharpening is sti more iphone still photography is very good on portraits but wideangle landscape and point and shot pictures are not the best compared to samsung note ultra though over saturated colours in some case still lot vibrant and bright
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,after satisfying synthetic benchmarks with the super hot oven titanium material following updates will throttle to contain the overheating then we will come to know how software fixes super heating oven
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and here are few mp photos taken with the new iphone those are the usual oily over more and the way they praised the flat frames just to change its mind now that iphones are little flatless just come here to read the comment sections hahaha reviews stopped being unbiased long time ago on this website
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dear gsmarenateam thank you very much for your superdetailed highclass review with lighthouse state for reviews in the market what have hoped for from content point of view has been fulfilled in perfect manner im very grateful and thank you gsmarena folks so much the coverage of the reception quality with sample corner in an underground parking garage or elevator and aspects of the distribution of offered zoom options in correlation with hardwaresupported zooming levels are perfect addition to your testing pattern the coverage of the behaviour of an iphone pro max being connected to an external monitor was also extremely helpful although did not like the findings but thats life and the test is not at all to be blamed for all in all lighthouse quality review which will enjoy to see for future smartphone tests as well since you dear gsmarena team really have reached unique quality detail level in smartphone and tablet reviews in the market chapeau for that result achievement greets aerni
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,youtuber disabled the image processing of the iphone and the raw image capture from the camera lens itself is really bad it doesnt look like apple improves on the lens at all rather the software
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,pro max phone with low max quality back glass
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its better to compare mp with mp heif photo mp heif is better than mp heif
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,they cover it up like never happen while other reviewer say otherwise it is overheating even more well mine aint so guess just got the one single good one then eh
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lmao percent performance drop is hilarious even juiced up snapdragon gen more true but would not dare to make the same statement with sd gen devices depending on the brand it could also reach drop sd gen fixed issues partially and the gen ones are stable more or less
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its software issue with ios my iphone plus also has worse battery life than it more so happy that left the apple family with the last iphone had being an iphone that one was kind of fine but with second all started to crumble with battery drainage and fast battery degradation the drop was sending the phone for repair via apple and getting it back with the lame message that there was nothing wrong while the battery was already down to after just shy of two months of usage and it was brand new one not refurb from then on never bought any iphone for myself give me android any time regardless of the brand at least im free of doing what want and share what want with whomever want and how to bad because they are well made devices when it comes to assembly and finish luckily as it already cost you an arm and legg to buy one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if needed the iphone pro max would offer zoomed photos beyond with good quality machine learning artifacts are not what would call good quality
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,great phone the pro lineup will undoubtedly be the most sold premium phone and by big margin as always
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yes good recommendation buy iphone promax
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the legendary durability toughness of the iphone is gone so now its not more then any chinese or korean phone well done applaus to apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ok this one has decent battery life thats already that but see that its more its software issue with ios my iphone plus also has worse battery life than it had before and heats up lot more
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,second to that my wife has an iphone and the photos have generally look that can onl more that because you all looking on those photos on your iphone display for that is okish but photos are made for the bigger screens where there they look at it should be of course the larger display should be at least an ips or miniled or oled
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nowadays only care for camera on phones and ipm is far from the best
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wellits good phoneexcellentbut its should be for that price is it offer real new from against pro maxrealitynope think keep my ultra and still drop plan to buy st apple phonesad pro max should need that mah batterymy case anyway so wait or even pro max model why dont think apple update model muchmight be wait or even modelsits just few yearsand then its time for me buy new phone anywayfor safety reason and and also there comung and ultras also ok work applebut not enoughtxerhh tx eu for usbc connectorand big thanks gsmarena for review
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the mp samples do look bit mushy at think it has to do with apple overly compressing the photo as stated only mb less than increase in file size for increase in resolution thats too little even for heic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no fast charge no eyephone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if everything goes well getting mine next monday camera system is so good especially with portraits which do lot
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,beside always saying the best iphone ever made there is another quote like never before duh
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so mp photos are now standard because apple has made it the default yes any androids after pro max will be mp by default lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it lost in gpu and more than on cpu basically pro max had better performance than more how are calculating that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,someones empty dream reality more from apples own product page on iphone pro the new photonic engine combines the best pixels from superhighresolution image with another thats optimised for light capture so you automatically get mp photos you really think you can make up stuff out of thin air and get away with it source trust me bro only works for your friend but not for strangers on the internet
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,night photos is really impressive good job apple but other than that iphone pro max looks really promising right now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it seems like the rear glass being more shatter prone was deliberate choice by apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and those camera lenses will scratch any glass they come in contact with surely another internet myth the titanium lens surrounds protrude above the lens glass sapphire or not and so the lens isnt going to touch any glass surface
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thanks to the new material chamfers and finish the iphone pro max looks and feels identical to the iphone plus and that is something core apple fans may find hard to swallow you dont think people will notice the cameras
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,after quite long time phone really like the night photography of personally im absolutely ok with that oversharpening similar approach to my older op nord night mode see the pics similar results which is compliment to op just in case of the traffic light intersection ip underexposed it bit perhaps the night mode didnt switch on but for its restrictive system polici ip is no go for me
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nice balanced review some people will hate it though
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post by gsmarena whose explanation isnt credible as the manufacturers official description or are you seriously believing otherwise you really cant be that obtuse can you look cant discuss something with person who has no english comprehension skills whatsoever ive been telling you to always check the samples yourself yet all you keep saying is ahh reviewer said this said that like how the hell am supposed to have conversation with you about photos and image quality when youre not even interested in seeing them yourself dont give damn about what personal opinions gsma give to each phone for instance one reviewer saying find pro produces waxy photo doesnt automatically mean it actually does produce waxy photos so cut it out already yeah
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,three things the most boring smartphone the least innovative device and the most recycled more and yet when you break down quintessentially what is smartphone and what does it actually do everyone is boring because reinventing the wheel just isnt possible to satisfy the boredom of few enthusiasts the iphone does what it needs to do quite well the same way the flagships from other phones also do pretty damn good job
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,is actually pretty low for flagship of this price
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,most of these features have already peaked and its only natural to see smaller incremental improvements instead of large generational jumps this way of thinking is the ultimate plague to innovation its like saying its boring but its okay they did everything they could with people thinking like that you can be sure that companies dont need to create anything new ever really wonder how someone with that mindset landed job at gsma place supposedly crowded with tech heads someone doesnt belong here
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,knew it mp photos using hdr then upscaled to because isp has no powerspeed to more both the balcony shot and the studio comparison shot suggest that iphones mp shots are slightly less detailed than mi mp but more detailed than other phones mp photos which is what you would expect from fusion of mp bayer and mp quad bayer images heck apples own advertisement even mentions that it combines the best pixels from superhighresolution image with another thats optimised for light capture youve already lost your argument at that point because youre literally inventing lies to deny the official claim by the manufacturer themselves httpswwwgsmarenacompiccmpphpidtypeidphoneidphoneidphone you once again are being caught red handed for not checking the actual samples on your monitor and choking yourself on what reviewers feed you because you stubbornly believe they never make any mistakes
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if apple reduced the maximum clock speed people would complain its not much faster than the more it already is not much faster than the previous model less than between the two chips
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nice and balanced review thought
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nothing new here an iphone with the same issues ive experienced on my pro at least this time we get new telephoto and the long awaited type port
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,tbf for that cpu and gpu heavy throttling issue it definitely doesnt deserve rating last year pro max was far more superior than this junk sadly with all these downgrades rather to pass this one and go with an android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,on the french site lesnumeriques their iphone pro max went up to and they find that no more if apple reduced the maximum clock speed people would complain its not much faster than the previous model
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so despite the bigger battery it gets worse battery life than both iphone pm and even iphon more
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the matte finish improves the grip too doubt
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why no cpu throttling its like gsmarena choose what to test some phone dont have more what do you mean the cpu throttle test is in the review
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,think bcos they opted for strong gpu nothing too catastrophic or drastic difference part of tech media believes the nm is not as good as tsmc wanted then the improvements were going to be small what they also believe made apple use higher frequency than expected as marketing purposes aka better benchmarks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,titan is beautiful
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why my pm batery health down after using month think thats pretty normal if youve been using it and charging it everyday or regularly got my plus in september which is nearly years and my battery health maximum capacity is down to now so it seems that year is normal
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lol you still downgraded the ios to what are you saying ios was the worst if you still more thats better dont worry you now have the ios beta here which is worst
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ios is the most pathetic ios update in apple history full of bugs and battery drain problem more lol you still downgraded the ios to what are you saying ios was the worst if you still downgrade it to ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,listen recently have some heating issue with this phone if you do some work over min in more geez thats bad maybe your battery isnt genuine apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so far ive been using this phone for year and months its absolutely great no more does the phone overheat easily bcuz ive heard rumors says that ip propro max overheat easily if its true then it sucks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im using pro max aaa version have no problem phone is good why my pm batery health down after using month
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why this phone was not prodided with finger print
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,been user this beast for months and it was great and no complained
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im lurker and never been brave enough to comment but this phone has been an expensive more how to turn off activity history on android phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,when can buy this phone usually can be bought in the shops online websites where it is sold new refurbished or used as is
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lovely phone and biggest storage for videostoked to have the tb on the newest pro max iphone camera is excellent new features like cinematic filming will be fun tool for video were about to have baby and film more than an hour every week at church and recently filmed close to students using asl so this was worth the upgrade for that alone and the night time photo quality has been improved too
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,aod is disappearing while carplay is in use hope apple noticed this problem and fixed it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,well so far am using both pro max and pro max but still prefer the samsung ultra hello would you say the jump to pro max is worth it over pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,had my pro max since october and so far very happy battery health at now still easily lasts full day and of course everything else is still great eg camera performance video is only beaten by propro max performance is fantastic as expected and the titanium build has held up beautifully titanium has not scratched by the charging port the way my pro max stainless steel did so my pro max can really pass for being brand new phone which guess will bode well for the person give it to when upgrade to my pro max late this year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,as long time android user should buy the pm or pm they said that the is not ma more why chosing ios over android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,just upgraded from xiaomi pro to pm am ufc fan and download fights from torrent is there any way can download on ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,look here guys im trying to be sensible here im not gamer or big user only th more totally disagree my iphone pro max is lot quicker and faster than my note opening apps and games iphone pro max is very fast and scrolling on my iphone is hz compared to and note hz screen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple ai is gimmick that eats up your battery spies on you and pretty much useless no one more this guy is such debbie downer while apple ai is not that huge of an improvement it is certainly significant in some ways rather than others it is also not spyware theres nothing apple could gain from knowing your inbox or searches with siri also the thing about it is that tanking battery life is also slightly untrue seeing as every generation of iphone has that happen regardless so recommend the pro just for apple intelligence and the base models otherwise
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ive just thought of something for you to add in the specifications in the battery section charger not included
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,can it support for tr on fdd band
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,in apple inteliance not and many mor feture miss out why apple ai is gimmick that eats up your battery spies on you and pretty much useless no one needs it and you wont miss it it may not be around long well see my phone pro max has it and shut it off you aint missing thing and with the new iphone that new button for the camera only serves to accidentally turn on your camera every time you pick up your phone that button will be gone on the an iphone se is all you really need or the for better screen camera
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,pro max can back shatter and become fire hot just get casetify case its unbreakable with it but it is expensive for one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,have one rn willing to switch to samsung galaxy ultra when it comes out though
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im going to give my year opinion on this iphone pro max gb unlocked from apple usa got this phone back when it came out and was preordered soon as set it up it was heating up like crazy after few months still getting hot but apple released an update that fixed the issue but it really underclocked the device after that kept the phone and it was very glitchy and kept restarting even the keyboard felt slow at longer texts now after year have dropped battery capacity and can really say it does not last full day now that apple intelligence came out siri is useless on this phone it feels it cant handle it and restarts after conversation with siri still gets hot after normal use and if use the camera this phone will lag insane im not going to upgrade to the just because bought this device in cash and spent lot of my money but im very unsatisfied with my unit and now the warranty is over after year im going to wait couple years to upgrade and hopefully apple does not make the same mistake that happen with this iphone get the pro max or the pro max avoid the pro max model in my opinion
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone pro max best deal in dont believe it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the series is trash get the pro max pro max can back shatter and become fire hot
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,please im an android user but want to begin using an iphone but please which iphone more iphone pro max best deal in
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,got today new pro max should go with or not see some battery draining reviews on it no
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hallo bro my iphone promax dual sim tray in on right hand side why is it so
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so no pro max congratulation
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,having experience ghost touch now on my iphone pro max but only if do gaming and if he more remove your tempered glass
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,outside is like real summer so its more than hot now its like celsius am from monet more so no pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,surely putting screen protector on and good case is the first thing you do when you get more me either
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hello guy stop blabbering phone pro max is no even of what you are even describing more only after days usage try months then say something about it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so promised that will post my opinion after finish testing my pro max tb so more lol maybe is an ironphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ive never had any overheating issues with my pm and battery life still at around when got to bed at around pm wont upgrade until the pm is out
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,gb minimum storage will be great for apple iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so was the pro congrats on buying the same larger phone twice you will only realize its not the same phone if you have used it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what happen my battery heart down so fast november buy now september my iphone pro max still
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,youre not buying anything so stop forming bs only if you were sponsoring me but imma use my own cash
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,did you chargeyour battey to always yeah charge it to
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,used this phone and its pretty nice with the battery being optimized
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,after months of using still got percent battery health with less than life cycle more did you chargeyour battey to always
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,battery is leagues better than can go over days without chargehad my phone for more accept what you are saying but than maybe my battery is faulty or whatever it is better tnah pro max but not even close to pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wait for an update or which version ios ur using and out side temperature also matter using more outside is like real summer so its more than hot now its like celsius am from monetegro europe the heat is presnt while using safari and after long use but not after gaming so dont get it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,slight heating issues can happen if youre using laptopdesktop charger to charge it or if more wait for an update or which version ios ur using and out side temperature also matter using same tb versions with no heating issue found
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,unsurprisingly really good phone wish had waited for the pm tho
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so after days of usage heating issue present nothing drastic but heating goe more slight heating issues can happen if youre using laptopdesktop charger to charge it or if you have one your case can heat the phone while charging some cases dont do that and if those are not your problems you are most likely lying battery life though you are correct the battery life on pro max is about to minutes less than pro max and to minutes less than plus
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,every kid that is years old has this phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hey googles gemini is telling me that iphone do not contains nvme storages have screenshot of its detailed answer but is not possible to post here you can ask yourself if you are sceptical too
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why areso boring nowadays
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im using blue tb and im extremely happy with my device good battery better ip rating coming from fold which was not at all good for my daily use
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,case that costs on aliexpress starts to cost on amazon thats true but why only amazon
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,come on we dont need to know we could just go to good electronics store or amazon and yo more case that costs on aliexpress starts to cost on amazon
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not everyone knows good cheap indiebrands everyone who has an access to internet can google cheaper cables its not an excuse to buy overpriced products and then complain
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,as we all know that none needs to buy the original you get decent one for which provid more not everyone knows good cheap indiebrands
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for cable is not cheap samsung and xiaomi cables are more reliable and cheaper as we all know that none needs to buy the original you get decent one for which provide the exact same speed
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,good best phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,but these cables are pretty cheap to buy you dont need to buy original apple too so many chi more for cable is not cheap samsung and xiaomi cables are more reliable and cheaper
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and the reliability of apple gadgets does not speak about the reliability of apple accessories more but these cables are pretty cheap to buy you dont need to buy original apple too so many chinese rd party for half or quarter the price available fast charging kills battery faster no matter which maker it is its just simple physics you force the ions to flow faster they get tired faster still last like years or so not bad though
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so it is fact that an iphone can be more reliable but not everyone has money for new ipho more and the reliability of apple gadgets does not speak about the reliability of apple accessories such as cables and covers you also cannot turn off fast charging in the ios settings unlike android pd kills the battery very quickly and generally leads to faster discharge
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,most pixels wont even last that long so google dont bother with slowing down galaxy phone more so it is fact that an iphone can be more reliable but not everyone has money for new iphone and refurbished or used ones usually require additional investment in battery or other repairs in addition only the pro or plus models have good battery which is very expensive for most of the world maybe iphone se will be decent lowcost smartphone because se is absolute cringe
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,used apple for long time and constantly noticed how it purposefully slows down gadgets so more most pixels wont even last that long so google dont bother with slowing down galaxy phones are the slowest of them after years though samsung doesnt need to android itself does pretty good job with slowing the phone in resale markets iphone retains the most value of all phones cause iphones are more reliable than other phones not feature wise more like device reliability
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its battery king phone in ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ultra is better right thats good decision because the advance of futuristic inside it so more recognize that the ultra is better in some areas but for my usage the pro max fits better
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone sare tatti phones hote hen just buy android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,comfort yourself used apple for long time and constantly noticed how it purposefully slows down gadgets so that people go to buy new ones didnt notice it on pixels and galaxy noticed this on android only on some failed models of chinese smartphones such as realme and xiaomi in addition some xiaomis are very reliable except for their speakerphone which over time began to work poorly
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,fake news comfort yourself
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,fake news ridiculous
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not in all products but am switching from samsung to iphone because samsung similarly to more fake news
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post not in all products but am switching from samsung to iphone because samsung similarly to other manufacturers is only on the paper for the advertised performance or it lasts maximally for months ps what am acknowledging to us is strong regulation policy ie for wat is written to be as such
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple best in battery life lmao how much they pay you for this ad gsmarena you gotta accept it for how slim this is its got excellent battery life
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why their battery still using mah because others futuristic technologies using up mah you know nothing about phones if think may compulsorily means better battery than mah
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post but their technologies still under the based of road in processing even the american still need the automation from japan futuristic advance right
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the best iphone the newbie only but more bugs inside
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the only reason dont buy iphones is because of the battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how to prevent the bug from this phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wait if pro max is good then buy it if not then pro max will be cheaper so win win situation also can try plus for the super chipset generation the most of the futuristic and advance technologies
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,which phone is worth buying plus or pro max plus with the best apps inside super fast and future phone generation
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this is cheap trash lol my iphone plus is so much better it is faster and has more apps iphone is cheap samsung cost like house you are strange
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yes now can because jailbreak easy with this device can make your own ios locked bootloader crapple product
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,limiting zoom to pro max models only is probably one of the worst things apple has done jus more yesunable to zoom for the great position right not futuristic at all
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ive switched from the pro model to the pro max and im telling you its more is it apple employee the best for you
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,currently use iphone plus and want to upgrade my phone to pm but heard media reports saying that iphone pm will large screen battery ai fast charging up to wireless charging better cooling system new design cameras and heard use in apro which ghzclock speed and now im confused then waiting for it in this year september mid thanks for reading my diary
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,can jailbreak this thing yes now can because jailbreak easy with this device can make your own ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,any smartphone even with thousand megapixels will take worse photos than the megapixel ni more thats pretty much bad example but yea you are right megapixels only plays huge part when zooming in very far bigger sensor with better software will always beat megapixels on tiny sensors
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,have no issuses with my iphone pro max if you not heavy user your battery will last longer what know inside of this iphone batteries still using pine wood in their component
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why so fast the drainage the battery cannot maintain its power consistently is it futuristic have no issuses with my iphone pro max if you not heavy user your battery will last longer
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,shall just have to go on waiting because to me the idea of anultrawide lens with only possi more any smartphone even with thousand megapixels will take worse photos than the megapixel nikon from simply because megapixels themselves mean nothing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wireless charging what is this lets hope that they at least improve the wired charging in the pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not an iphone fan but believe iphone is stronger due to its nm processor nm processor still cannot save from bugs right till now alway fix to fix while update
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ultra mp fps fps gb ram vs pro maxs gb oh sorry pro more not an iphone fan but believe iphone is stronger due to its nm processor
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,rarely make changes and rarely fix bugs worse than android yes absolutely true always fix bug option once update ios not much upgrading or something new expensive but bugs insidenoted
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no its not confusing its confusing if you are first time user of ios and that more rarely make changes and rarely fix bugs worse than android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,probably already waiting for pro max to buy it for seconds faster instagram opening so slow need to use isos andre system for more fast and beautifull image
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ios setting make confused for their user be right with samsung almost updated feature so fut more no its not confusing its confusing if you are first time user of ios and thats completely normal ios rarely makes drastic changes because they know that their users are not that skillful and its like shooting yourself in the back if you change something drastically
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,think we all can agree that samsung has more features and so on but if you want less feature more ios setting make confused for their user be right with samsung almost updated feature so futuristic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yes we all know that iphones dont have that video recording now lets also more think we all can agree that samsung has more features and so on but if you want less features and easier user experience then probably iphone is better samsung users can fix problems themselves because most of them knows how to google and iphone users are mostly lower iq than others thats why iphone is better iphone doesnt have so many features settings so you cant be confused
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,looks like apple has nothing new to offer no video recording nits screen brightness more yes we all know that iphones dont have that video recording now lets also add that mp camera now if were to sell my pm and then go with an su will that immediately make me wanna take videos for the rest of my life and also start taking photos to point that will resign from my work as bpo rep and then just take videos and mp photos all day long dont think that ever wanna quit my current job that helps me in purchasing the gadgets and pc parts that look forward into getting in the future and such so hows your life now as videographer and someone who takes photos just for the heck of it imagine that you are no longer working at all and just taking videos and photos all day every day every dang day wait so youre not video grapher nor someone who just takes photos all day long then why boast the video recording of the su even when it seems that not all smart phone users dig into that video recording thing with their teeh and nails just to make video even if is it the lowest quality of video camera from smart phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no it doesnt is more detailed and for now su is the best resolution recording more now did do my research device thing made or adapted for particular purpose especially piece of mechanical or electronic equipment so basically any mobile phone is device and same goes for red digital cinema camera so dont throw in your opinion that the su is the best recording device out there but then say that it is so unfair to compare the su to an actual digital cinema camera device theres nothing wrong with voicing out your opinion that the su is the best recording device out there but dont start yelping out when someone tells you of an actual device that does the job better than your favored su
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why apple dont makes the main camera megapixels samsung made the ultra that have more mp on camera used to take photos of the drink or food pastry that did get in the past year while having planned staying in mode in starbucks and then post it on fb well that was when used to have fb just me taking normal photo making sure that the photo will not be crooked and there are times that would even consider then using the portrait mode just to have blurred background effect now mp on camera why so is that so can take photos of the neighbors that are like kilometers away while theyre doing the nasty why boast phone having camera with mp is the first that you do when you wake up in the am grabbing your mp camera phone then heading outside to take photo of the beautiful morning sky and making sure that you have your phones camera all the way to that mp also do provide yourself with the answer to this question rate it from how often you plan to use the mp of your camera phone on daily basis since youre boasting about the mp that camera phone currently has you shouldnt even drop lower than when using the mp of your camera phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,oh meaned iphone pro max sorry how to tell if your phone has macro camera is that when open the camera app on my pm and it shows an icon of tulip on the bottom of the screen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for apple fanboys not everone is woke rest of us need software features flexibilty that are more absolutely

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,am not saying about photos am talking about videos because you were saying that ul more its not smart to compare normal cameras to smartphones especially when the sensors are much bigger in normal cameras but guess youre not smart enough to realize that your comparison cant be used for real
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what about nokia nd gen is your sony mirrorless cameras can take such great photos more am not saying about photos am talking about videos because you were saying that ultra shoots the best videos in the world right now and it is definitely not true because there are red cinema cameras as well as sony and etc digital cameras which can shoot more detailed and with higher dynamic ranges than compared to samsung your logic is incorrect

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you use and love android yet are reading the comments section for an iphone and you are more apple haters are all secretly apple admirers they come here with their awful androids to come and envy the iphone and spew vitriol because they dont have an iphone its like this in every iphone article across all tech websites always android users who obsess over us apple users and apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ifanboy without any idea display mobile semiconductor everything come under samsung ele more all you have done is further validate my pointgo and look at their quarterly results where they split the electronics business into the divisions spoke about
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,got ios update can update no are there any problems after the update if anyone ha more no dont do it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,still nokia remains the real legend of the phones

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what the hell is going on here
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post alright thats enough of this dont know what your problems is kid but havent called you uneducated jobless worthless or ermoran anyway cut the attitude there is no need for it got my doubts on your educational claims but seeing as neither of use can prove anything about the other ill take your word for it one thing you show nothing of though is maturity this was conversation about antutu for heavens sake and all have done is link whats on their own website if you dont like that then take it up with them you meanwhile have called me bunch of names and now started going on about government employment or some such nonsense saying you got chip on your shoulder doesnt quite cover it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and what are you another talking head boasting about being some bigwig and complaining about more speaks for yourself ibot like saying not to waste time yet replying to each comment
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,again some random crying other than replying to any of my points properly alas your govt can more and what are you another talking head boasting about being some bigwig and complaining about all the time you are wasting on worthless fanbase whilst doing exactly just that id hope you have some educational value somewhere dude cause on the concepts of irony and hypocrisy you are like child take your own dam advice and stop wasting everyones time oh and get over whatevers causing this massive chip on your shoulder pal
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lmao has this man been thinking about it for hours typical fanboy without job and look more of course you are all those things everyone on here always ends up making similar claims was just reading the antutu website is all and they suggest their test result are not reliable for cross platform comparisons you on the other hand are just another of many talking heads here blowing bubbles and making grandiose claims whilst being tad obsessed with company you dont like rent free is the term that springs to mind and you chimed in on this worthless fanbase dude mean were you just randomly taking time out of your busy day to look at the comments section of device you have zero interest in or was it something else dont answer really dont care stop wasting your valuable time and go do all the important stuff you claim to do
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,heres also the most recent android test results from the antutu site httpswwwantutuc more lmao has this man been thinking about it for hours typical fanboy without job and look at the title it said android list then why it would include ios youre just another proven fanboy no wonder how does it justify your claim rather its the other way around in the same way geekbench also has separate pages for different platforms they dont even include different platforms with the same computing architecture still those ships with big names compare arm mac and windows yeah typical fanbase without minimal intellectual level and remember im postgraduate in electrical engineering and added on top also cisco certified both ccna and ccnp not gonna waste my time explaining to that worthless fanbase
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it was said when antutu had test methods for ios compared to test methods for android at more heres also the most recent android test results from the antutu site httpswwwantutucomendochtm they still list android and ios results separately by that way even using the latest antutu version and this is stated right on the page antutu was developed based on the unique technologies of different platforms crossplatform products may not be directly comparable so it would appear according to the devs themselves at least that there is still decent level of ambiguity on this but hey as user of this very device guess im just member of this fanbase and therefore not on your intellectual level but then who is right
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,youre supposed to understand what has long been common knowledge there is no direct correlat more it was said when antutu had test methods for ios compared to test methods for android at that time later they made it crossplatform thats why all the test systems are similar now throughout the platforms mentioning this stuff again and again for years by the fanboys without having proper knowledge shows the intellectual level of this fanbase lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so iphone pro max gets on antutuv while galaxy ultra gets and im su more youre supposed to understand what has long been common knowledge there is no direct correlation between antutu scores for ios and android here one of the many times the developers themselves have stated this httpswwwantutucomendochtm

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,limited os anti consumer measures price charging not compatible with android exclusive hw its more limited compared to android yes but for most consumers which are using mostly whatsapp facebook and instagram thats not problem anti consumer measures strange but whole apple ecosystem is probably the best if you buy few items from apple they can communicate super easy its hard to leave apple after you get used to this price literally every flagship costs over bucks maybe oneplus is lower compared to others ant thats it charging advertised maybe yes but in reality it can charge with proper charger for most people its more than enough not compatible with android whats exactly not compatible with android have an iphone and android can exchange messages mails photos lol

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what exactly do you need if you need reputation rich person if you need high efficiency more iphone camera is ugly why mate the iphone camera is one of the top camera in the world

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post thats real camera if samsung really manage to fit optical zoom on tiny phone thats what we call innovation anyhow samsung galaxy series are the best phones on planet earth
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the iphone pro models will no longer have ram as long as they dont freeze like my phone pro max dont care apple need to sort out the problems with the pro max

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,btw what is antutu its benchmark right well benchmarking means to rate something more you can reply times the fact of the matter is that the developers of antutu themselves advised that the antutu benchmark on ios and android is not comparable as it measures different things on the two platforms it is not cross platform
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the good thing about iphone is that it has speakers up on the phone at the bottom and the rest is history
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,remember the reason people are excited about year old android feature coming to iphone is not because they like to pretend apple invented it its because they have been waiting years to enjoy that feature without having to deal with all the bugs glitches crashes freezes and bloat of android the problem isnt that apple is bad or good or outdated or new the problem is that the literal only alternative android is completely entirely unusable mess
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,typical stupid people would say clearly you cant afford it just buy android good luck on prod more you are making valid point see no reason should invest on apple product with outrageous prices when other android brands can definitely suit my needs there are still better android phones you know but the hype apple product gets is crazy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hoping something new on the next generation iphone is aspect ratio instead of or because its been many years since the iphone until
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,antutu literally have blog article specifically telling people that the android and ios scor more btw what is antutu its benchmark right well benchmarking means to rate something according to standard if the iphone scores suck then it might well mean that they arent built for it some benchmarks are more inclined to android others to apple in terms of my eval recall seeing similar performance in nonsoftwaredependant benchmarks may have exaggerated little bit
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,xd they claim its the fastest soc in an iphone to date yet it still got demolished by more just mind your ownif anybody want iphone samsung oppo or other brandi dont careits your choice and decision to buy and use it like me im using nokiaanybody have problem with that if youre concerned with my phonethen please buy me one and gift it to me
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,simple answer is ios once used the iphone cant separate from ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,using antutu in your argument immediately proves its failure suggest you try reading nex more the only thing was saying is that theres nothing there to opt for this model if you have lowergeneration iphone with all the lightning cables the iphone is better cause you dont have to buy the new usbc cable the new chip has similar performance as the pro maxs bionic and youll turn out with more expenses than its worth see nothing wrong with the antutu evaluation the iphone has its good sides but when youre saying that its the allnew best soc im expecting something more especially from apple if youre switching from an android its the best choice but maybe wait little so the price drops
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,by the way which phone do you have by the way tried to ill be there lets continue this song
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so so look perfect and advance right
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone is useless looting people by name just started periscope no folding phone samsung wa more so
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yes can piece like special model of xiaomi phone right thays good by the way which phone do you have
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,your post emphasizes the importance of more about phone pro maxfor more detailsclick here
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mate iphones are simply just ahead of the game in battery life for the battery capacity watc more they are way ahead in terms of efficiency when the unit and battery is in new condition but in years they degrade and never get the same efficiency as if it was bought new hence why battery health feature is worth checking thousands of times
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hey have you ever bring powerbank whenever you go outside with your iphone and charge tim more mate iphones are simply just ahead of the game in battery life for the battery capacity watch videos of iphone pro max vs other phones battery life test
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,battey is weak file manager is worst and processor is very slow switched from ultra more youre like writing poem bro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,update from ultra to pro max all can say its master piece better polish software more yes can piece like special model of xiaomi phone right thays good
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,realized that this phone is super awesome after month of using it yet its so underrated dont like the titanium material though but iphone promax is beast
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,laptop desktop watch iphone and ipad all my devices are apple branded couldnt live without them
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,after update ios my iphone pro max my battery always heating and become hot condition then the percent become dropped very fast
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone haters are at it again who cares about widgetslol smooth simple to use ios more hey have you ever bring powerbank whenever you go outside with your iphone and charge times day ever got your iphone repaired and pay of the unit just for the display and backdoor glass im really really really sorry think just broke your iheart and imentality
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,upscaled at fps with temps getting up to lmao worse than expected
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yet runs at fps lololol too pushy and desperate releasing console games into flagsh more upscaled at fps with temps getting up to lmao
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you fanboy cant leave benchmark numbers alone it perform lower on the benchmark yes more cant even rival the iphone pro max was already ahead of any phone with snapdragon gen its already been confirmed if you make research and watch youtube videos from mrwhostheboss youll find out when he put the rog phone ultimate to gaming test against the iphone pro max even with the aeroactive cooler the rog phone ultimate lagged while the iphone was smooth
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,upscaled at fps sure it runs so well how can you expect mobile to run game like that in fullhd fps even if it was powerful enough to it wouldnt be able to have enough cooling
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ha ha ha after payment time more price think gen is more then enough or may gen al more yes its true th gen or the value selling price is less than half of its original value
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wait for other players in market like oneplus or samsung ultra its only one or two months away
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no you dont know your talking about is there nm chip yrs ago ha ha ha after payment time more price think gen is more then enough or may gen also at half or less than half price
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,old age phone can buy years flagship android in same price bro iphone pro max too expens more no you dont know your talking about is there nm chip yrs ago
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,running perfectly fine here at fps too bad for your brother keep fooling around your decieving urself
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lol dont fool yourself it can never run at fps my bro has that said device and it more running perfectly fine here at fps too bad for your brother
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yeah it is hilarious how the snapdragon gen performed well in the reference device but more you fanboy cant leave benchmark numbers alone it perform lower on the benchmark yes but in real life performance the so called pro cant even rival year old snapdragon gen when it comes to gpu and stress test of not because of optimization rev wouldnt even be playable out of the box at fps bruh stop kidding yourself and wait for the real scores
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,clearly you dont know what you are commenting if you are saying oneui is apple ios reap more and widgets were thing on the old windows windows phone os years ago before that they have been thing on pc for even longer
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hope your iphone wont combust fps is impossible to be playable with unless more you do that happily playing well on my pro max thanks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the primary factor preventing me from transitioning from my pixel pro to an iphone is the cu more so scrolling left and right for back is better than left for back and right for forward wasnt having more options the selling point for android or is that just when you need to bash apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the only reasons why dislike the iphone pro max apart from ios itself is that it more you can change the tone of the photos from the camera app but why bother using it when you can just comment instead right probably because you dont even own one just read reviews and watched yt video
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,welcome with new generation games resident evil village assassins creed mirage and lot conso more it is great time see even the apple haters often spend more time here than at their own crappy droid sections the fact that resident evil village is basically direct port from the pc version and still runs so well on ios with the recent updates really bodes well for future releases can see many of the apple haters are curious and lurking around apple forums more than ever
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you just talking to fill the comment section that is not irrelevant at all its the more yeah it is hilarious how the snapdragon gen performed well in the reference device but in the retailing devices it once again falls short of apple series chips the pro basically has no competition until next year when the pro lands
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the arrangement of the cameras is very ugly the set of cameras is very large compared to the phone iphone pro and pro max is more like camera that has phone as well think in iphone or the whole back of the phone will become camera it looks like the surface of the moon
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,those are crappy chinese phone that doesnt even based on stock android but some crappy more the xiaomi series as well as the iqoo series are expected to be released globally soon you pal are not informed well at all iphones chipsets are always among the best out there im really surprised you didnt know thator better said you dont believe it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,released where that chipset dont come out globally for while so its irrelevant you just talking to fill the comment section that is not irrelevant at all its the newest chip on the platform the xiaomi series and vivo iqoo series have it and apples bionic chipsets always are ahead as for gpu performance
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,again what are you yapping about and am talking about the magic pro cameo more released where that chipset dont come out globally for while so its irrelevant
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,because the phone has the fastest storage the fastest ram and the fastest chipset right now more the magic pro has the fastest chipset the gen was just released dude the pro has the gen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dollar device that dont have fingerprint scanner budget android feature again what are you yapping about and am talking about the magic pro cameo what about it how is it the best and fastest phone out there
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lol what what you yapping about dude dollar device that dont have fingerprint scanner budget android feature
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you confuse it with the honor magic pro lol what what you yapping about dude
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how did compareby paper or reviews or by using real one do have ultra its screen br more know iphone is popular but dont you see people with samsung galaxy fold and samsung ultra series and galaxy series in peoples hands samsung galaxy ultra is expensive yet some or so many people still buy it while iphone pro max is still available
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,galaxy ultra its better compare together for days after of course bought more how did compareby paper or reviews or by using real one do have ultra its screen broken after fall from pocket height costs for repair then charging socket has an issue with loose connection even earpiece is producing cracking voice now regarding battery it drains fast camera is good for zoom purpose otherwise pro max takes much better photo and way better video than ultra and ios is much smoother than android pro max getting warmer during charge but it is ok with new phone for initial few day uses brother dont mind could have buy pro max but ultra is much cheaper than pro max and yes please do not use uv curved glass on it its glue will damage ur motherboard and charging ic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this time iphone durability is big mark
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,worlds fastest and best phone ever you confuse it with the honor magic pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ultra loses for curved screen also system storage of gb lmao gb system storage is for the terabyte version the and gb takes around gb to gb and also its not samsung fault its google android and their heavy apps forcing all apps to run in background and the curve screen is wider than the pm
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,next joke please its alot smoother than most laggy android phones can tell you that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,my android doesnt turn into space heater have new iphone pro max and can absolutely tell you there is no heating issue on this phone been using it alot and indoors where heating has been on in warm room with no issues its all overblown as usual and battery life is fabulous on this phone it just goes on and on
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,have been using it for two days now the initial transfer from iphone plus to the new iphone pro max with data size of gb took approximately hours through wireless transfer so far have encountered no issues and everything is working perfectly on the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you should know these have tons of storage and ram and are optimized correctly so your android more my android doesnt turn into space heater
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,people cant even change basic camera settings on iphones and youre talking about more you should know these have tons of storage and ram and are optimized correctly so your android will definitely have better or same specs but optimization is not thing there so it will be laggier
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,really the iphone pro max is the worst phone do sense teensy tiny bit of hyperbole there worlds fastest and best phone ever
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,worst phone really the iphone pro max is the worst phone do sense teensy tiny bit of hyperbole there
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone is the best way to go if you are into videography all the best tools for this are also more people cant even change basic camera settings on iphones and youre talking about tools lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,worst phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,after compared meizu infinty same fast with this iphone so good and great
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,same spec with oppo the best of the best
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anyone know how there are iphone china models with the axxxx part number like for us etc from other regions these are being sold the model number is china model but the axxxx part number is from another region useurope etc
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for videography better iphone pro max have both for photography use better image more but nowhere near image quality of the pixel pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hi am looking for phone basically for pro videography on everywhere people are comment more iphone is the best way to go if you are into videography all the best tools for this are also well tailored and best optimised for ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,exactly the android users come here to try and justify their poor purchase decision of anot more the only reasons why dislike the iphone pro max apart from ios itself is that it doesnt use quad bayer sensor for the telephoto and ultrawide cameras the telephoto is tiny type vs my google pixel pros type the selfie camera is tiny type even though it could easily support type sensor the lens flare on the cameras is ridiculous even compared to other phones the camera software produces photos that are way too yellow this one applies to all iphones tbh all of my issues here are about the cameras and tbh most people probably dont care about it as much as do its the perfect flagship device for people in the kind of way the samsung galaxy ultra or the google pixel pro are
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,looks at samsung huawei users
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you will never see an iphone user interested in knowing about any android phone but we all se more that right
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,actually would like to see zoom comparison between the yearold huawei pro with the iphone pro max because both have optical zoom lens although know iphone pro max will definitely gain its edge
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nah there really isnt anything to convince me to get yet another samsung product zero more who would have thought usd phone is better than your usd samsung phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,after week of using this beast and keeping it updated the overheating issue is gone think its usual to brand new iphone this phone is awesome and the camera upgrade is fantastic ps prefer steel frame though the titanium build in pro max is soft you have to have solid case to protect it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dont be shy and visit su forum when it releases youll see lot of apple fans more nah there really isnt anything to convince me to get yet another samsung product zero good experiences so far dying right after warranty ends or having to be rmad just too much inconveniences if go back to android it will never be samsung phone and iphones hold their value so much better than any android phone that its already worth it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hope you heard about the mac and macbook pro and
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the most underrated iphone ever couldnt agree more with you it really is the most underrated iphone ever so far
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,small tips for fast battery charging use low power mode when charge your iphone it will charge more another tip to turn off your phone it will charge even faster than low power mode
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,according to magfast thats myth its actually technically true but just by bit as it reduces battery loss during charging
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,snapdragon gen is here
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton oct complaining here is not going to solve it carry guarantee sold the phone had it covered got my money back and bought an ultra and fe
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,many problems are seen in iphones pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the battery dies very fast and it heats to degrees the titanium breaks very easy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,battery dies too fast doing nothing dies even faster doing close to nothing never happened to my pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post eeeeee ha hi like that dude
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dude apple has to make money so ofc they would make it even tho it costs to manu more not only premium but being trendsetter
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,glass is glass there are fad too many variables to take into account to trust drop tests als more they know that glass is glass but iphone back glass repair isnt cheap and they are damn fragile even worse they integrate wireless charging into the back glass pathetic at best guess iphone series were the last series with separated wireless charging component apple is trying their best to make repair even more difficult
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nice such great light phone with awesome camera system yep just go it done setting it up and im updating the os now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,cant wait will get this delivered to me today lol nice such great light phone with awesome camera system
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,guess what those self proclaimed overrated fans towards iphong pig men is very more according to drop tests also my last pro was meant to break with just one drop think dropped it times in years and didnt crack the glass and have never used cases with my phones and ive never cracked the glass you never know how it goes when you drop the phone with bad luck its one drop and someone else can drop many times it depends where it hits just like can find many different results with drop tests depending which one look
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,will make guess for the and we will probably get kfps video
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,pixel pro way better than this shower of crap using my pixel pro even on full resolution more so why are you here then why feeling so insecure httpswwwtomsguidecomfaceoffgooglepixelprovsiphonepromax after looking through how they compared against one another the winner in this faceoff is the iphone pro max apples flagship doesnt disappoint especially in key areas such as battery life cameras and performance sure youre paying more for it but the difference is justified by its better overall performance and the fact that it comes with base starting storage of gb sounds like you did wrong choice mean it wasnt even close iphone pro max points and pixel pro only
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nice phone it costs dollar to manufacture so id pay dollar max for this they have pro more how this is different from any other brand companies need to make money havent you seen shark tank noone sell product with manufacture cost not even close thats called business
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you are forgetting something apple is also down in sales for example in china and china mark more im not forgetting anything ive already count those to my numbers iphone sales are down samsung whopping china isnt biggest country for iphone us is and there the sales are very high which can compensate rumoured lack of sales in china if thats even true
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,that might chance this year like already said apple just need to have their normally good more wouldnt really concern myself with sales numbers where apple will win big this year is removing the gb pro max meaning that their asp will probably rise significantly profitability will be incredibly healthy hopefully apple do fix their supply chain early enough for the holiday season though glad got my pm quickly went for gb model this time which tend to be more in stock think many will be pushed to gb and even tb which could mean jump in asp
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple will always be more profitable while samsung will always have higher sales due to the la more that might chance this year like already said apple just need to have their normally good and they will beat samsung in sales if samsung cant surprisily actually grow sales samsung sales been down so much in recent years this year alone samsung sales are down from the last year already low sales
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,will huge success of pro max lead apple to number one spot over samsung for yearly smartpho more apple will always be more profitable while samsung will always have higher sales due to the large volume of cheap phones they sell
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its hard to tell cuz apple is struggling with production they need to sell mil mor more im not following your math if samsung sells million they have sold for the world year if apple sell million theyve sold why apple need extra
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,did some counting samsung apple more its hard to tell cuz apple is struggling with production they need to sell mil more than samsung to reach your mill at the end of the year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,have purchased new box pack iphone pro max canadian region so the face time is not activating on my cell number any reason
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it is heating like ass while on charge cannot even use it that titanium frame is useless mine is too and in hand and ear
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,on call for mins and it getn crazy hot on my ear and hand
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its very possible samsung last year sold only million more than apple and samsung sa more did some counting samsung apple difference before and if everything goes well for apple they can sell million more than samsung in
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no it wont it can be the most sold smartphone but in global sales dont think its very possible samsung last year sold only million more than apple and samsung sales are already down this year like million apple still have their strongest left which is this they can sell like million more than samsung this and if samsung sales keep going down also in like theyve been every this year apple will be number one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,that is because you havent used one lol just get used iphone and your life will be better
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,naomi sep what ram gb lpddr
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,looked at the comparison you made between iphones and when viewing your target image the pro max appeared to have considerably softer image on the extreme edges this can most noticeably be seen when looking at the red heart at the bottom left of the target very soft it indicates poorer lens regards
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,say youre locked to the android ecosystem isnt it ironic there is no such thing as an android ecosystem lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,with all due respect how come this is better when it doesnt even have the basic services tha more that is because you havent used one lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you pay and get brick that locks you into apple eco system what joke say youre locked to the android ecosystem isnt it ironic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dxomark just released iphone review points nd placei know knowno one cares abou more did anyone ever care about dxomark

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post screw apple chipsets they are nothing but supercomputers with walled garden on top qualcomm and mediatek is still superior even though they are competing against each other at least consumers never disappoint with them

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,repeat my own comment just played asphalt for minutes and honestly it was pa more so pianful as of what

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdgfmmbwj thats how your fixed update perfor more repeat my own comment just played asphalt for minutes and honestly it was painful to even play that long it ran perfectly smoothly for whole time phone didnt got hot and brightness stayed maximum for whole time the game itself was just pure crap luckily thanks to apple we iphone users can soon play real games instead crap like this
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thats weeks old video like said its already fixed know it very well more httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdgfmmbwj thats how your fixed update performs in real world

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,honest review about pro max httpsyoutubemqzqetqnu
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no they are not gone its still overheating and think they slowed down the cpu you still have overheating dont believe you fixed mine completely and many others based what read you are first who still have problem but actually think you dont even own the phone correct
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,overheating issues are gone now can say it from experience after installed ios this more no they are not gone its still overheating and think they slowed down the cpu
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,httpsyoutubecomshortsqnvknqvsmsifrqbtxsvmz thats weeks old video like said its already fixed know it very well my pro max got warm randomly for two to three days when got this then apple released ios and instagram fixed their app and these fixed the issue and after that my phone havent felt warm even once
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ultra vs iphone pro max httpsyoutubecomshortsldcrazjwqysiswijnsmscyffp this more wait for the sultra and compare this httpsyoutubedjaerbasimkmjbemoagwiik
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,amazing minutes more while having less features and higher price overheating issues overheating issues are gone now can say it from experience after installed ios this phone havent felt warm even once
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,real games and phone cant be in the same sentence thats more so you didnt knew that resident evil village is coming end of this month for iphone also resident evil coming later and other console games
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and httpsyoutubeisyorozpkisitzikkpvhstmxd wasnt no problem beating ultra more amazing minutes more while having less features and higher price overheating issues
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,just played asphalt for minutes and honestly it was painful to even play that long it more real games and phone cant be in the same sentence thats like saying in us there are no school shootings everyone knows its crp
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,only mah in flagship really and httpsyoutubeisyorozpkisitzikkpvhstmxd wasnt no problem beating ultra dont be brainwashed by the numbers
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this is more real life usage watch video on youtube iphone pro max vs ultra heavy more just played asphalt for minutes and honestly it was painful to even play that long it ran perfectly smoothly for whole time phone didnt got hot and brightness stayed maximum for whole time the game itself was just pure crap luckily thanks to apple we iphone users can soon play real games instead crap like this
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,seems like we got the next generation of flat earthers who suddenly became currys knowhow in more seems like you try to support your own statement on different comment but your location says that you are the same person thats more pathetic than flat earthers you have mentioned
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,that game is from im pretty sure when resident evil village comes out it runs grea more this is more real life usage watch video on youtube iphone pro max vs ultra heavy workload test speed battery thermals most people are grown up that uses pricey phones in other words its more common to see multitasking microsoft teams and other stuff on phone instead of genshin impact
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it has to be joke hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha stop looking at the mirror
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,studying does not necessarily mean they are smart if you have good memory you can get diploma more it has to be joke hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,we have added system improvements that will decrease the cpu consumption when running as more that game is from im pretty sure when resident evil village comes out it runs great do you seriously think they would show it in keynote and release the game for iphone if the performance isnt good or it has problems with performance mean wouldnt that be very negative look for apple who just showed us how phones can now run console quality games by the way isnt genshin impact like the benchmark for mobile gaming performance nowdays how did iphone pro max beat ultra without zero optimization for new chip httpsyoutubeysldbcbqwbsirqvvhdjinacvr also ultra run lot warmer and also throttle
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,asphalt got already updated which fixed performance we have added system improvements more we have added system improvements that will decrease the cpu consumption when running asphalt on any ios device that shows it cant handle intense power usage due to thermal design whenever you multitasking heavily cpu usage will be high unless you underclock it with software to avoid hardware issue with poor thermals in other words with this thermal design it cant reach all potential this chip has
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton oct the majority of apple users say renowned actors millionaires rich businessmen people of more studying does not necessarily mean they are smart if you have good memory you can get diploma pretty easily there is difference between intelligence knowledge and intelligence with knowledge when youll grow up youll understand love technologies but its strange that apple does major mistake second year in row last year it was battery and now thermal design is pretty poor for very capable cpu snapdragon gen is getting lower results on benchamarks but in real life its better and handles heat much better compared to iphone pro max watch video on youtube iphone pro max vs ultra heavy workload test speed battery thermals
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you dont have to be an expert to see obvious problems but its not known for most more as someone with cs background let it be known how pathetic your statement sounded about overheating only being hardware issue when nvidia or someone release driver updates to address overheating issues for their gpus for specific games you dont go around saying its hardware issues do you or maybe you do because idk maybe you lack brain
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this is quite really weird this is new but the ultra has better specs
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,imagine pretending to be software and hardware engineer expert you dont have to be an expert to see obvious problems but its not known for most apple users because they dont use brains
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you cant fix hardware problems with software doubt underclocking powerful chiptheir more imagine pretending to be software and hardware engineer expert
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,have pro max and after update to ios device become lag why apple do that why lag old more ios hasnt been good in general its filled with bugs overheating issues and app compatibility problems the lag your experiencing will be fixed in another update apple is doing damage control with their lineup at the moment
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bought mine and using it never been happier the trends have always been bashing on apple an more as much as people hate on apple they always make solid devices this overheating issue is temporary and when the new batch of are up for sale the problem will be gone android vs ios will always be around and they both have pros and cons lot of people love to express the cons when they feel one sided to the competitor youll find lots of examples in these comment sections
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,watch video on youtube iphone pro max vs ultra heavy workload test speed battery thermals this phone cant handle power usage aaa games on this thing is gimmick it seems for apple benchmarks real world sad
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ios has reduced the overheating issue of this phone leaving one less reason not to buy more after updated to ios this phone havent been even warm even once in normal daily use so what apple did definitely worked
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,want this for my best friend
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,even in ray tracing it still beats the exynos what do you mean by even from what see online thats only where it beats the sdg can you prove otherwise
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ios beta test relese
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,your honor you said the sdg couldnt beat the exynos and related it to long more even in ray tracing it still beats the exynos
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it lags to make the customers upgrade their current device to new one thats apple more no because then they would not buy an iphone again makes absolutely no sense but many people here dont need sense they only need conspiracy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bought my ip pm with mixed thoughts personally liked titanium blue its super elegant anyways battery time is superb no heating issues so far enjoying my phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wrong search for the last comparations and reviews most will tell you to get exynos and sta more in my country maybe your country will recommend to get exynos but mine well they always recommend to get phones without exynos chipsets or snapdragon chipsets made with samsung architecture in this instance the sd gen sd and sd gen are the prime examples of snapdragon chips that are overheating because of the samsung architecture as what they speculate but if have choice between the sd plus gen notice that capitalized the word plus because there are many folks stating that the plus gen and gen are the same but clearly they are not starting from the architecture alone or an exynos chipset would always pick chipset with tsmc architecture within it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone pro max tb
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,to prove you wrong you still with the copium proved me wrong what you coul more you still with the copium proved me wrong what you couldnt prove me wrong anything with your invalid statements and proofs quote from an exynos shill
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,oh so is someone just comment how much better are apple chipsets or qualcomm chipsets cou more at least they provide good evidence youre just beats it in rtx and never say what else did exynos beat at
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thats in your case your honor you said the sdg couldnt beat the exynos and related it to long term performance meanwhile the sdg beats the exynos in everything but raytracing im not someone who hates exynos just dont understand why you lie about that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,exynos gives good graphic performance as well but its useless if it overheats in minutes pieces of razer phone cooler may help
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,critical thinking doesnt strike at least not yet thats in your case
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,actually content creators and youtubers in my country recommend to stay away from exynos why more wrong search for the last comparations and reviews most will tell you to get exynos and sta away from the and the gen chipsets
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,youre just commenting too much about how exynos is better than the others which just sho more oh so is someone just comment how much better are apple chipsets or qualcomm chipsets could call them fanboys as well
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so were qualcomm fanboys because we managed to prove you wrong entirely more to prove you wrong you still with the copium proved me wrong what you couldnt prove me wrong anything with your invalid statements and proofs
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,exynos may get good thermals only if they put thermal paste directly to the cpu modify to add more exynos gives good graphic performance as well
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,type is gen not up to gbps transfer speeds means gen it is also mentioned in apples support page httpssupportapplecomenmyht it would be really helpful if you actually mention the transfer speeds on the specs list type doesnt mean anything by itself it can be gen gbps gen gbps genx gbps etc
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if you cant do basic things like contact syncing and making phone calls on an android ph more ad hominem
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not looking good for apples cameras what you mean new iphone have great camera more thats completely true all comes to preference
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post not looking good for apples cameras what you mean new iphone have great cameras every oem cameras nowdays are more or less same level the differences are really small
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so much controversy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple annouced it in januraury copied wrong again it must be hard being an apple fanboi and continually found out to be wrong
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its not worth for its price durability is mark
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,more smooth than iphone samsung flagship phones are starting to bug really faster than more last saw an iphone pro it had longer animations than android has on the setting always turn the animations off or to the lowest possible setting if the animation duration is short enough guess thats why iphone users think androids isnt as smooth when irl its just faster
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ws oct last iphone had was between now and then have had htcs samsung oneplus etc that more exactly real man talks about its specs not about its design or performance
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this just shows how uninformed apple fanbois are the first touchscreen smartphone was the lg more the prada also known as the chocolate had been announced in december before this hp nokia and motorola launched touch phones with capacitive panels lg announced the recisive panel for that phone that was overshadowed by the iphone even though the lg will be announced first
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,last iphone had was between now and then have had htcs samsung oneplus etc that being said it sill amazes me that people are having android vs iphone arguments who the even cares not only everyone is free to use whatever they want both sides have plenty of great phones and at the end of the day comes down to personal preferences still there are plenty of fanboys vs neckbeards out there whose sole goal seems to be taking dump on someone elses preference
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,guys need some wisdom simple answer to buy iphone pro max or not
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wait for while so far no heat issues phone doesnt even feel warm
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,planning to buy but some issues are heard confused wait for while
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,love how absolutely none of you got the point the point isnt that apple invent more if you cant do basic things like contact syncing and making phone calls on an android phone the problem is not the phone you need to look in the mirror to see the problem
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and where did everyone get the idea of smartphone from apple if it wasnt for more this just shows how uninformed apple fanbois are the first touchscreen smartphone was the lg prada released in march iphone didnt come until june apple is very good at copying and sometimes refining other companies ideas but not so good at coming up with new ones of their own
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,here to see all the indians complaining about phone they could never afford hello kindly do some research on no of iphone sales in india
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphones have better speakers than samsungs and thats just fact pro max durability
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,got my pro max crazy how this feel as light as my smaller iphone pro well done apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,better screen better gpu better speakers what kind of opinion is this iphones have better speakers than samsungs and thats just fact
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,it was running out of battery faster because the capacity in iphone battery is less compared more no that wasnt the case here it was the aluminium which hot very cold in winter next iphone didnt had any bigger battery but it had glass back so the phone couldnt get cold sameway and battery last lot longer
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if you take dxomark for granted then it shows that your real it knowledge is poor it knowledge arent we talking about camera here trust my own eyes and know from years of experience and photography that iphone camera is great and this year even lot better leaving from work to get my pro max now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,cant agree with that it felt very cold in winter also ran out battery because of that it was running out of battery faster because the capacity in iphone battery is less compared to similar class androids all batteries hates cold but for smaller capacity it hurts more
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,stop the nonsense httpswwwdxomarkcomsmartphonesappleiphonepromax iphone pro more if you take dxomark for granted then it shows that your real it knowledge is poor
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,good thing is even if they throttle the performance to reduce the temp it will still run faste more think you have information from years ago su with snapdragon gen even performs better than both new iphone pro max and pro max better heat management more smooth you can take worthless benchmarks im taking real world experience where android with snapdragon gen performs better and even costs less
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,using ip pro max and ultra clear can say ultra is better phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this is not even good competitor against ultra no where close against upcoming more better screen better gpu better speakers what kind of opinion is this
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,still feel that it is missing things to be complete and perfect such as reversible wireless charging fingerprint reader under the screen or fast charging of at least right
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this is not even good competitor against ultra no where close against upcoming ult more this is not even good competitor against ultra no where close against upcoming ultra this is lot better because this run ios it also have better camera better cpugpu better screen noticable less weight which is important thing for such big device better speakers better battery life did miss something
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,from pro max to pro max the best one to get now to use is pro max tb next year best deal is pro max tb who actually even clicks photo miles away nonsense comparisons everytime this that its mostly just music social media calls texts imessage some photo video media youtube have both pro max ultra tb you wont use iphone if you use ultra because iphone sometimes just for some pics or music or something mean there is just nothing there really
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton sep what reason is there to continue on android type port screen one of the best dedicated more you cant be serious right besides the usual bickerings of support for different software features the thing that made android explode into the success it is today is because of its ability to run on any hardware undeniably this certainly has its drawbacks optimization battery drain but it has allowed the mobile hardware sphere to flourish now not everyone needs to build an operating system from scratch for their phone this lowers the barrier of entry into the industry significantly which is great for consumers like you an me we all have our own gripes with various operating systems but it is important to recognize android for its contribution to the industry
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apparently you also hated going to school and learning proper english sentence structure co more lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dont get the new processorbig battery but less battery endurance
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,really since day hate apple devices why do you hate them did they kill your pet or fire you from your job its just phone company no one forces you to buy them
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what is this titanium are for even abs plastic will to perfectly for phone frame or chassis at still the glass can break at any given time for me if you want innovation and reliability instead of using titanium use polycarbonate frame and sapphire glass for the screen to at least sow us your smartness
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,everyone makes fun of exynos being super heating beast and underperforming own pro more apples soc is very powerful but they pair it with subpar cooling for example usd android smartphone with gen is already using copper heatpipes for better heat distribution while apple at the price cant even provide better cooling its like iphones were designed to be powerful in order for people to scroll better on their social media apps throw game on it that utilize the full potential and all temps go high and throttles lot
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,perhaps the heating issue will though wonder how will they fix the structual integrity of more spigen cover and problem solved after all it is just glass not rock that cannot be broken that does not worry me
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,would not trust something that breaks easily lol rather stick with iphone or android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,any heating issues planning to buy but some issues are heard confused
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,maybe she is girl theres never wrong gender to hit the gym
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yeah and the frame thats color fading when in hands overheating that you cant hol more wow first time that phone has had problems just coming onto the market wow hahaha at least those problems will disappear in few weeks in android there are manufacturers that have had the same problem for years the fractionation is one not to mention the many others
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nah you just need to hit the gym maybe she is girl
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what reason is there to continue on android type port screen one of the best dedicated os dedicated chip now with periscope zoom which distanced an android phone from an iphone apple closed that gap now the only thing missing is the money between the pro max the new watch and headphones to start with the ecosystem they cost no less than dollars
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,too heavy its actually surprisingly light apple did great job with the weight this year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,theres lot frustrated android fans here who hate iphone but se more just like every single year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,too heavy nah you just need to hit the gym
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,too heavy must be weak asf to find heavy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,too heavy dyel bro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,when see ads titanium was impressed usb type until jerry rig everything video released only middle frame was titanium and usb data transfer even slower than usb android has been used titanium but used coating same as samsung armour aluminum but used coating coating gone paint gone too and scratch kunlun glass is the one iphone samsung should be alert and dont buy iphone pro below same goes other brands quality and parts are different trust me
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple iphone are better an in storage and app ive never owned an iphone but guess will next time
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,too heavy then you havent held the pm and the pm
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,qualcomm fanboys comes back again critical thinking doesnt strike at least not yet
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the bionic and the bionic suffer of overheating but not lot compared to the new more youre just commenting too much about how exynos is better than the others which just shows this account is basically just about trying to promote exynos
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,is there third party equalizer app that works on both internal speaker and wireless
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,both su and promaxsucks in demanding games it throttle alot after mins due to bad bad more actually xioami phones sucks at their cameras yes they have improve but it is still nowhere near what the cameras of samsung iphone huawei honor can do
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,sure they are because apple did so well by the way have my own eyes and can see th more do not believe that dxomark is paid but do believe that some of their phone camera reviews are somewhat questionable also the fact that the pro max was defeated by phone that was unfairly banned due to competition and is also using more than year old chip is somewhat wild
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,exynos fanboy strikes again qualcomm fanboys comes back again
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,seems that the qualcomm gen chipset having the advantage of better cooling in the red magi more dont know if you lack critical thinking have some sort of reading deficiency or both but the exynos beating the snapdragon in only the gpu test doesnt mean its due to thermals im genuinely unsure what point youre trying to make
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and may not suffer of overheating only if you bring phone cooler with you no mat more the bionic and the bionic suffer of overheating but not lot compared to the new pro chipset in the other hand its exynos having good thermals
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what is the rtx performance test are you referring to the one test android author more seems that the qualcomm gen chipset having the advantage of better cooling in the red magic couldnt beat the exynos imagine the ultra exynos with cooler running that test will have even more advantage in the long run performance
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dont listen to apple haters true as former android samsung and pixel user have to say like the iphone lot more the battery is amazing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dollars for ultra lol what are you smoking in my country you can buy one with thats around dollars with months of warranty but if you buy an open box one or brand new but without company warranty week test time is available its gonna be close to thats around dollars so yeah its dramatically cheaper
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dxomark are paid reviewers sure they are because apple did so well by the way have my own eyes and can see the results and iphone did great job sorry
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anyone its long process but you can change the icons to look like ios id say that you should go to youtube to see the tutorial of how to do that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how funnyu cant shoot videos from that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im sure everyone saw how resilient is the new ip pro max titanium frame assure that all force impact and pressure goes on the back the result being defense shattering rampage on poor device also dont forget the heat and this is no miami so for me is fail pass
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this iphone pro max is brilliant the performance is unbelievable the new apro chip is more sounds very good already ordered mine from the preorders but havent got mine yet should come next monday cant wait to test this beast especially the cam
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post dont listen to apple haters
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ok so we finally have camera comparisons between promax and pixel pro and the pixel won more stop the nonsense httpswwwdxomarkcomsmartphonesappleiphonepromax iphone pro max is second best cam out there
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,about the overheating problem in my opinion try to repair the latest ios system ios because for my iphone pro max the heat is very significant if it compared to the previous version ios if overheating issue occurs because of the ios update is true its mean apple not only saves the iphone from overheating issues but also the previous version of the iphone series good luck for apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wish they would return aluminium back it felt special cant agree with that it felt very cold in winter also ran out battery because of that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,many people are buying phones for many different reasons some are for cameras and some are fo more yep iphones are very expensive
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,many people my self included hated apple for many reasons for removing the charging bri more think they removed the charging brick from the box so that their phones can be cheaper and if people really want charging brick they will have choice to buy it or not thats still saving the environment
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not everyone cares about just cameras though lot of people like the simplicity and ease of more many people are buying phones for many different reasons some are for cameras and some are for daily usage and many people agree that iphones are literally overpriced devices
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,one is just buying its name for status symbol this iphone only has watts charging while ot more actually bro the techno pova is just entry level phone iphones do tend to have superb battery life thanks mainly to the fact that apple uses their own chip and their chip is very efficient and the fact that iphones software the ios helps so much on improving its battery life but agree apple admitted that the battery life on the iphone series does not have any improvements on the iphone series and to top it off apple has an issue on chipset throttling and what is their solution to throttle down the processor their is nothing wrong with it but what is the sense on putting powerful chipset when you are just going to throttle it down so basically buying the iphone but on higher price guess that is some greedy bs but real time performance you wont notice specially if you are using the phone on playing plants vs zombies finally do agree that many people bought an iphone for status symbol purposes it is really great and rare to find people who recognize apple devices as device and not as status symbol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hi guys its me again its always wars between android especialy samsung and iphone its ok bcoz we are human we will fight everything
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not the revolutionary part but the fact that it takes up just about the same size as normal more many people my self included hated apple for many reasons for removing the charging brick from the box and solding it separately really charging brick is part of smartphone and removing it is such freaking bs and what apple said they care for the freaking environment damn they could have just admitted that they want to be greedy af and to charge more money to the user lack of innovation yeah the only innovation have seen apple has done is to remove the charging brick from the box remove the mm earphone jack and to charge people more money for the same phone over and over again repairability apple just couldnt get enough that they do not want others to repair your phone so that they could steal more money from the users pockets and they could just recommend new phone to the user even the phone is still repairable so more profits again to apple finally the usb by far this is the most greedy bs apple has ever done first the usb connector is insanely expensive the incompatibility to other usb cables aka android usb connectors and finally the safety concerns surrounding the apple usb apple really wanted to profit on the connector so they made other usb cs incompatible to the iphone so it is just lightning cable then finally it is said that plugging other usb pins on the iphone can cause heating issues and potentially freaking fire so apple really wanted to sacrifice the users safety to earn more profits huh do not get me wrong apples are really powerful devices but the hate is not specific on the device but more on the company itself due to being super greedy yes apple devices are meant for higher class people but sacrificing peoples safety and removing an important part of the phone from the main box is just absurb but apple does not have to worry because there will be people still rich enough and an apple die hard fan enough to buy an apple device no matter how greedy they are if apple will experience what boeing experience in the past years maybe apple will learn to be more gentle on their doings but right now nah they will just get greedy and greedy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what boring phone for showing off purpose only
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,had pro max then pro maxfinally got pro max days ago first time since yea more need this phone but dont have that much money
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,have you heard about the sony xperia it has everything the iphone lacks for vs more who tf listen to fm radio anymore keep seeing this comment about the lack of fm radio like wth are you guys mentioning this slow internet in your country
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,well thats your choice enjoy your android device and dont let anyone get you do more samsung fanboys are by far most rude people dont even understand how its possible why they tend to buy samsung phones when you see people writing very rude comments in these comments ask which phone they have and times its samsung atleast now when samsung being doing worse and worse for many years theres less and less of them anymore which is very good thing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iv missed series thinking there is nothing worth to change my pro max using the more had pro max then pro maxfinally got pro max days ago first time since years my phone went out of charge while was sleeping dont know its just software issue or hardware related but do agree with you
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,personal opinions or experiences will not make me switch either first impressions of apple pr more well thats your choice enjoy your android device and dont let anyone get you down just for owning it apple has toxic fanboys but so does android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,blatant lie then you used your android exclusively for making calls and surfing sure guess did use my lg galaxy galaxy and galaxy plus only for calls and surfing im that bored right lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,in india the price of the base model is around usd or inr still origin more why are you so surprised india is the biggest market for brands like xiaomi vivo oppo etc after china arent those chinese brands yall buy and use stop your propaganda
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple say this phone have amazing hardware well its true but guys where is multi tasking whe more propaganda bro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yeah in fps and severely degraded graphics for gaming exactly pfps where did the hz refresh rate go or the breakthrough pro so even the cant run this game they had to add pro to the because it can run rev at fps
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,exactly what said elsewhere people tend to switch between different android phones trying more another lame comment cant specify the android device people tend to switch from or all android are the same
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,really do got the honor magic pro which is practically on the same level as the pro more not everyone cares about just cameras though lot of people like the simplicity and ease of use of ios the better app support stability ect unfortunately android oems heavily customize the os and make it nightmare for anyone to switch between device manufacturers ive never even owned an apple product but definitely know this just by talking to the normies who use apple products
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,all phone are exactly like that unless you get an android from years ago have you heard about the sony xperia it has everything the iphone lacks for vs less if you look well well almost no fm radio
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,in their defense they were forced to change to usbc they didnt want to change ugh prefer apples own design why were they forced to change
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,another interesting take saw recently promax vs pixel seems like the held its own pm won some won others we are talking about usd difference wow
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,same spec with as
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,whats new with iphone is that they lower the specs from wattage to wattage type more in their defense they were forced to change to usbc they didnt want to change
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,phone is only for rich kids and upper classical admit want to buy it little price plea more do you know what it means to save to buy something you dont have to be rich thought id share this one but id better wait to see if the ultra comes out next year but from january will start saving on package destined for the iphone pro max or ultra or whatever they call it and the watch that comes out in now is the key
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,am hooked with apple since iphone gsnot easy to break up its kind of personal choic more very bad and uncomfortable operation system in my opinion
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,everything seems good until you try something better and the rog phone has always been superi more am hooked with apple since iphone gsnot easy to break up its kind of personal choice plus your ecosystem rog is great choice for phone however still think iphone is the best when it comes to video and sound photography guess pixels and sammys ultras far better
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,most of my friends invest all in bought ip pro max or other models and been using it for years but couldnt afford any other apple product to stack things up for apple ecosystem lol they only uses cheap wireless earphone oem charger casing etc
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dont get it cause will call it circus show with only jokers inside every show not the serial killer one from the comics or movies or whatever indian government prime minister modi and apple ceo all are doing promotion on made in india so am going to be completely frank on this matter am not apple fan boy and call myself lucky to not gotten into matrix of apple ecosystem now come the main thing why am mentioning all of the above nonsense words tried to look for the apple iphone pro max version on both apple india online store and on amazon too found both websites mentioned the origin of the phone is from china apple build the manufacturing plant in india and doing major promotions that they made significant portion of apple products in that plant this year but they are selling china made products in india why
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,that is an actual iphone fanboy talking there what said is just fact sorry
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,understand that its very hard concept for androids users but eveyone prefer different more am not saying samsung is better but most android manufacturers have more options than just phones year like apple iphones no micro sd card slot ever on iphones oh and iphone buyers are either rich stupid rich or flat broke from buying one they could not afford and taking years to pay it off iphones are popularity contest or peer pressure to buy one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,now what is hilarious is when goto best buy website and read reviews of android phones and they say they were long time iphone user and hated it then when they bought the android phone they never turned back well to me it is funny because as said iphone users are so stuck up with themselves they would never switch to android phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thats your opinion ive been an android user since was kid and few years ago moved more personal opinions or experiences will not make me switch either first impressions of apple product owners are just rude to me that is cult and judged just for not owning apple products
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,would never buy iphone for one reason or another iphone users will never stop when talking to an android or pc user until they get the person upset they are no tv salesmen they are worse than that they will blatantly will not stop until the person gets insane and about to kill that person those fanboys can say the same about samsung but have used many android phones and samsung is great company but not the best to me but will not for main reason buy apple any product just because of the rudeness of the consumer owners of apple products they will not shut up until someone is pissed it is like they think they get commission for the apple sales or something
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not because use samsung ultra but it is better in both battery and cpu iphone max uses older hardware and less battery size while uses newer hardware and better battery size when it comes to usb samsung uses latest version while iphone uses the older model who charges faster samsung uses faster charger which comes in min while iphone in minutes deep comparation
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,samsung fanboy mathematics samsung su equal to iphone pro max samsung su pret more thats reality
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,gsmarena recently like to delete my comments however have been recently using pro max more are you sure the speakers have improved
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,comeon where is review sure st pro max model
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if you compare everything you can see that the samsung is the bestwhether you like it or not thats your opinion ive been an android user since was kid and few years ago moved to iphone no looking back
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post that excuse would have worked for one to two years not easily over ten years row is it that hard to accept that apple makes great products which people like to use nothing to do with brainwashing of course brand helps sell more because everyone knows the brand but they made their brand name for phones from nothing also we can see from samsung flagship sales that brand name alone dont work if your product doesnt meet your expectations galaxy flagship sales are down year after year for reason people just didnt see the value while apple getting bigger and bigger every year this might be the year when apple outsells samsung in unit sales for the first time ever it also tells lot
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,still cant believe people are fighting over which phone or os is the best you guys are more if you compare everything you can see that the samsung is the bestwhether you like it or not
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,every year the same thing apple fanboys bla bla bla android fun boys bla bl more damn boy you are right samsung is much bigger inch actually btw samsung even managed to fit spen inside ultra
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,sounds like skill issue on your side ngl dude am asking for some help for software related issues we are not playing soccer here right what skills you are looking for let me know
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bought one honestly its good for day to day use battery life is good but on gaming its hot run some throttling test and its down for its performance
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and is this something revolutionary is it something new no it gets so so boring people more not the revolutionary part but the fact that it takes up just about the same size as normal mp photos is stop hating on apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,these bitter android boys getting more and more comical every year good news is that there more can never be samsung users fake news located
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,advise you to wait because the defects of the iphone battery didnt appear with use more oh yes you are right just came to know that cracking back defect just been discovered which rises questions on the durability of the product
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how its better watched few camera comparison and it wasnt even close iphone won more yeah yeah iphone won this or won that who said its not case of who wins or who is better its not scientific facts personally think apple image processing is dreadful and early reviews show lens flare is still present despite so called lens coating something true innovators sony do better and the zoom has more noise over the pixel pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,finish off the iphone dear god just enjoy your phone and stop the iphone isnt going more these bitter android boys getting more and more comical every year good news is that theres very few of them anymore most already switched to iphone long time ago
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post finish off the iphone dear god just enjoy your phone and stop the iphone isnt going anywhere
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,samsung and android is the best im still using thumbs up all the way you are not relating to the topic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,stop defending an overpriced phone with compromised structural integrity if the case can already protect it well from that whats the point of increased structural integrity also just get one of these and tell me if its overpriced or not stop hating on apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dont avoid buy this phone just because the back glass cracks easily put on case and more stop defending an overpriced phone with compromised structural integrity
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,are too trash that the exynos was able to beat in the long run the qualcomm ge gpu in more exynos fanboy strikes again
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post show me some videos please
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,httpsyoutubecplisjzcnwsinejjzyjcmoxgsk iphone easily won iphone even won night more disgusting youve used mrwhosetheboss video to prove your point like struggle bug phone with no camera at all can take great pictures all need is just professional camera separating the feature from the mobile phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple offered better zoom quality iphone offers natural colours samsung just overd more cope
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,do iphones not have bitkhz audio like the samsung galaxy ultra
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bands for are wrong missing reson appe posted wrong info on release on site httpswwwapplecomatiphoneprospecs always right was httpswwwapplecomdeiphonecellular
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post httpsyoutubecplisjzcnwsinejjzyjcmoxgsk iphone easily won iphone even won night shots most surprising is to see how well iphone digital zoom works would have expected worse quality from but how it can keep up that well compared to samsung optical
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post apple offered better zoom quality iphone offers natural colours samsung just overdoing it by processing photos lot sometimes it works and sometimes it gives very weird looking fake photos iphone offers consistent results no matter what you shoot just like the reviews and comparison videos shows also just the flexibilty between different cameras is from different level and speed taking the photos it feels like you are just using one camera because the experience is so seamless and smooth
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this phone feels so light around same weight than smaller pro big achievement there from more yeah in fps and severely degraded graphics for gaming
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ok ultra is months older and like usd cheaper and the camera is still better than more how its better watched few camera comparison and it wasnt even close iphone won easily it was hard to believe those phones are released same year usually you dont see that much difference between different phones almost only thing where iphone lost was zoom quality
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for wire charging which adapter is needed
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why apple not give camera mp and video recording up to next iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton sep els ultra is not year old it came out in february it will last months ok ultra is months older and like usd cheaper and the camera is still better than the new usd iphone samsung is the absolute king of phone cameras
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,glass breaks very very quickly ive seen few yt videosamazing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,when gsmarena will make their tests sound lufs etc
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post yes will buy phone and try to bend it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,excellent review
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so it will take apple additional years to come to charging while others will probably get hilarious
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,was that ironic or something cause cant believe what just read yes any help
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hi everyone seem to be confused between the pro max and pro want better phone which more advise you to wait because the defects of the iphone battery didnt appear with users until months after the phone was officially released give period of time for the phone to undergo long reviews to discover the defects
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,just wait for the bro thats going to be very better phone agree
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deleted post els ultra is not year old it came out in february it will last months
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for what on earth would you need tb on damn phone you plan to use it like years and take more different perspective here as the job im working in requires me to not waste times transferring large datas like those dozens of vid and hundreds of mp let alone mp pict files so by such condition im required to edit and manage media files directly on the phone without being delayed by such transferring step
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,assume that your present phone is dead so think with the sameequal price youd be more was that ironic or something cause cant believe what just read
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hi im kinda guy who only took photomonth and it was my own toe rarely making call alway more youre hermit and shd be living in cave then wth are you still doing with phone in the first placeyou dont need one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,android doesnt need more ram it just has the ability to use all of it all of the more with gb lpddrx can it still run gta on android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for gsmarena please review this asap including the answer of my question can we save any more just buy flash drive hard drive require more power to work and does not even work properly with android and ios device either
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,but which is better buy am torn between choosing an ultra or pro max love the wa more out of those id go for the iphone better all round phone far better video capabilites and better content consumption phone if youre going android then probably most other flagships other than an su its mid tier flagship phone by this point unless its the best price you can get for an android phone of this caliber to be honest wed need to know what specifically you need phone for and how intensively youll be using it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple has ios which is not like android android needs more ram you understand this or are more android doesnt need more ram it just has the ability to use all of it all of the time ios doesnt need to no it essentially closes all appsclears ram usage from the app the instant you stop using it very very basic explanation to whats going on an android phone with gb lpddrx modules would absolutely blow any iphone currently available out the water for loading in to appsweb pages essentially always have the apppage pre loaded in to the ram reserves so it wouldnt be fair contest to apple at that point
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hello gsmarena team we all reviews readers from all parts of the world are waiting eagerly for your detailed and accurate reviews of iphone series phones and it seems that youve not started working on this tuff task yet come on our well known reviewers do start digging well about these all four members of series hope youll especially understand our concern
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nice phone good specs would love to get one if it is running android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if were you would choose su as the main diver and buy the cheapest iphone you can ge more am on both operating systems use pro bought used and note gb bought new on the first day it hit market not once did face any problems with it over the last years
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,in is in this is the cheapest pro max in years
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and the exynos doesnt suffer of overheating and may not suffer of overheating only if you bring phone cooler with you no matter the environment itll always overheat
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,brother woke up and chose violence then apologize brother jimbob to not reply him politly and thanks to you for remind me
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,youd be really glad if samsung did not make exyheat chips for the they only used more and the exynos doesnt suffer of overheating
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,exynos and dimencity are trash you can only compare sd gen against that wins with hug more are too trash that the exynos was able to beat in the long run the qualcomm ge gpu in the rtx performance test
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bionic nm single core multi core exynos nm btw released month more comparing outdated results from an old geekbench version isnt accurate also comparing scores that cant be compared directly since geekbench uses different apis for measure the performance in the cpu better see real life tests httpsyoutubeqnhfipplsisivshdoykbxqtj even the note exynos was able to beat the pro max with the bionic thanks to the optimization
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lol doesnt need it sooo why not gb ram why not buy camera instead of upgrading more apple has ios which is not like android android needs more ram you understand this or are you that naive tot think apple can not use like gb or even gb they can but they dont need to
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ios is betterb than iphoe series
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,this is definitely huge step up from the pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,very uglythe camera is looks like philips shaver brother woke up and chose violence
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lets approach this from practical standpoint in reallife scenarios fast charging proves to be incredibly beneficial but its notably absent here furthermore ios gesture navigation leaves much to be desired lacking even the basic swipe on either side of the screen to go back feature found in android although the natural titanium color is appealing can accept the absence of fast charging in the iphone pro max as it will have great battery life for sure but the subpar gesture navigation on ios compared to android is dealbreaker for me
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,my brother as seen in the comment despises the iphone but would recommend the iphone pro dear george listen to your brother
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,note had more apps open maybe its just that they look like theyre opened but more but which is better buy am torn between choosing an ultra or pro max love the way apple animations works through the ui but the ultra looks more appealing in features seeing both of them for similar price and am used to both ecosystem tho so dont really mind if uve usedown any please let me know
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the whole aim was to tell him that ram isnt everything in multitasking not performance oh get apple optimization is on another level bro everything works buttery smooth
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,locking at the battery size its bit bigger than pro max camera bit better and the cpu is the next oneup oh and the front and back glass have been redesigned and the charge port is now rip off of android might wait for the pro max or whatever its going to be called
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,but wait minute folks as usually compare the specs of phones do even remember to compare the flashlight at all apples iphone currently has the flightlight with the highest lumen whats ur take
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,which phone do you recommend me samsung or iphone pro max my brother as seen in the comment despises the iphone but would recommend the iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,again bro the the bionic is definitely faster than an sd cant simply compare th more bro apple has optimized the phone to handle two ultra cores and other cant because the two ultra cores will suck more juice from phone and also generate loot of heat if not optimze
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what do mean bro maybe compare midrange android to flagships iphone but lemme tell it more note had more apps open maybe its just that they look like theyre opened but theyre not
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,gb of ram having gb ram ip pm still runs unbelievely smooth today and my regulat with gb still runs smooth just imagine having an gb ram this thing is beast
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,good time to buy iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,heard rumors state iphone thickness increases due to filling more mah but it turns out it was just xd
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no but just take look at this its not latest to latest but you should get the point more again bro the the bionic is definitely faster than an sd cant simply compare them xghz vs xghz who would win rather compare sd as its also nm soc seriously if qualcomm use the cortex series cores at higher clockspeed think qualcomm would then be the fastest smartphone soc but no they wouldnt just filled with confusion thats why like apples combination xghz or higher it makes the core android look weak with just coresif apple switches to an core cpu then it would be not any xxx configuration qualcomm mediatek exynos are all confused must they use the same configuration till when they start using or maybe even xx then theyll win apple as for now nope
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yeah get those gb and gb for higher prices and make that extra ram useless due to the so more what do mean bro maybe compare midrange android to flagships iphone but lemme tell it doesnt work like that on flagship had gb ram note plus and gb ram xs max the samsung usually have more apps open while cant say same bout the iphone xs max fast forward to series saw video of them rebooting an ultra and when it came on it still had pubg opened when he unlocked the phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how late are you this camera design has been around for years how late you process if you check carefully this design started on iphone pro while you can find philips shaver which belongs to so iphone is just giving philips shaver its not bad to add shaving ability on series
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wifi thats it samsung had that years ago comeon apple rog had it years ago update your iphone same design since used xs the best iphone till now iam using my wife told to get an iphone but nope samsung rocks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,erhh where is missing mah battery capacity applewhy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,one interesting thing like about apple is their consistency in design unlike samsung that more is it that they have to do it like this if they give you everything mentioned in single package what are they going to offer in the next generation companies want money understand that they want money and cell phones technology is stagnant and monopolized
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton sep dont think it would work with just gb if so apple would still offer gb devices tho more yeah again these are just my speculations and also dont mean it as in minimum amount of ram it needs its more like how much ram it uses
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for comparison stock degoogled android runs at gbs of ram average stock android runs at more dont think it would work with just gb if so apple would still offer gb devices those are just rumors
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,an iphone with gb ram can beat gb ram android phones owned samsung galaxy ultra more for comparison stock degoogled android runs at gbs of ram average stock android runs at gbs of ram average oem android versions on average and from experience run at gbs on gb phones gbs on gb phones and gbs on gb phones respectively meanwhile ios speculation runs at gbs ram average
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,think upgrading from pro max to pro max wont be much of upgrade more to that personally dont like that brush texture it feel like someone forget to clean the glass after soap water mop however like multifunctional button instead of ringsilent slider
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,father of mobile phone is nokia yeah late grand father
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no agree how will gb ram beat gb ram maybe is the way you use it that why you dont agree but thats facts
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you are crazy apple increase for gb because gb is much limited in multitasking but androi more yeah get those gb and gb for higher prices and make that extra ram useless due to the software autoclosing apps extra ram is useless its the optimisation of even gb that counts even gb ram iphone can beat gb one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple continues the trend of wretched consumer predation with usbc years after their own ipad no thunderbolt displayport or fast charging just when think samsung is gouging people for an inferior priced oneplus heres apple with the years greatest contender for customer abuse
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,finally gb ram iphone pro max do ultra look worse in multitasking because only gb more have gb on my ultra because in the settings can add more ram memory which will use that storage space
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,finally gb of ram can finally run roblox my iphone cant even handle the game hopefully my att store has some in stock this friday
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,one little correction samsung flagships are the best on the market use samsung but iphone have better optimization and oneplus ace pro better raw performance thanks for gb ram but samsung have the best cameras and better system interface oneui is the best in resourses
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the whole point was to show that ram isnt everything that makes multitasking smooth more you are crazy apple increase for gb because gb is much limited in multitasking but android gb will lose for ios gb because of optimization but nothing beat android gb or gb ram in multitasking now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple iphone has better cameras optimization performance useful features more user friendl more only if you upgraded from fake welcome android device then youd say the same way
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,android can download vulnerable apps but apps in iphone cant ur data is safe which wo more however your may be still safe using an android device if you didnt download and sideload an app from sketchy source
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,are you referring years old videos to prove your point just typical troll then should more the whole point was to show that ram isnt everything that makes multitasking smooth moran lol keep avoiding facts
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,source trust me bro no but just take look at this its not latest to latest but you should get the point httpsbgrcomtechiphoneprovsgalaxynoteultrareallifespeedtest
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,android has nothing to do with usb am using iphone pro max before than had iphone more has nothing todo nothing thats your theory okay then whats your next theory cheese has nothing to do with nachos yeah not all cheese are for nachos but all nachos has cheese
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,do you mean you cant access youtube anyway link one of those videos for me quite sure you cant though
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you mean youtube from dreamland do you mean you cant access youtube
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,finally the series are here think that they are good looking phones even though they are having same design for years believe that this is their final form maybe
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the difference between apple and samsung is that they belong in different cultures apple will more you should mentioned that this was only your personal opinion
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dumb people more like only dumb people will buy ultra because of more ram more this is why education is important for fruit users go check countless videos where apple cant keep up with android because of short ram in multi tasking where apple is still inferior
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the ideal iphone for me would feature robust mah battery and fast charging capability these enhancements would greatly enhance its endurance and user experience eagerly anticipate these improvements in future iphone models making them compelling choice for my next upgrade iphonewishlist
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,youre quiet happy about it you mean quite happy you cant spell may be you should get an pro max first then may be we can talk about my spelling problems
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,samsung is actually and obviously better than apple in virtually every aspect more the difference between apple and samsung is that they belong in different cultures apple will always be more efficient more stable better looking more ergonomic and seamlessly integrated in its ecosistem but more conservative in features and more expensive while samsung will aways have more functions more hardware and will try lots of new things some which make sense and will eventually be adopted by the industry including apple and some which make sense only to samsung for instance the bending glass displays which if pushed by pr money far enough will seem like thing but laws of physics will eventually win and after all the money and the effort spent they will eventually prove not to be desirable product if you are not already in one of the ecosystems to choose one you will have to ask if you preffer comfort or novelty
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,man im dead for price in india get if from canada with lower price and get box seale opened via friend from there
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,king of spy no can disable the spying feature in settings google it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,time is money so to charging is hour industry standard mobiles got less than minutes for to charging apples tech team is old gen believe they bring same design and add feature for latest mobile dig through market the generation phones are capable of what and how apple can build stronger than them branding apple makes money if guys can crack before launch the current standards of any mobiles then im sure all people will go for apple even if costs are times higher than now
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,only dumb people buy either iphone model gb ram on pro models sony xperia and samsung more an iphone with gb ram can beat gb ram android phones owned samsung galaxy ultra and an iphone pro now all can say is my iphone pro is little bit faster than my ultra bro maybe you dont own any apple phones gb ram iphones is likely equivalent to gb ram android phones
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yup agree your right but the problem is not being fan its the wrong idea of these peop more is also same case indonesia kinda funny people who use iphone or will straigh up call you poor for not having iphone and theres also lot case people sell there kidney just buy iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,all android phones beats iphone easily waiting to see apple release ifold and fold the com more nah every phone has its own strengths
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,average iphone users charge their phones times per day so it is not very efficient at all you really had to exaggerate just to show how bad iphone battery is better luck next time bud
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mert sep every iphon have trash battery and everyone knows it as trash as what this comment is just take look at iphone pro max vs samsung ultra httpsyoutubebvpmoegrsiwvvdcqtlohe the videos not in english but you can see the battery life at the end of the video
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,always sd gen but pro has better speed highly recommended avoid fhd display recommen more father of mobile phone is nokia
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the bionic chip is the best chip ever it packs great performance at just cores and offers more youre right but there are some emulator you can download
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,pre ordered mine yesterday and quiet happy about it honestly android has always had bett more youre quiet happy about it you mean quite happy you cant spell
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,sure if all you do is sitting nonstop inside the phone no wonder why you need to charge it twi more every iphon have trash battery and everyone knows it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the only new feature see is the type connector copied from other
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,pm should have gb ram for games equivalent ram fro iphones to android phone is about times so gb iphone is approximately gb android as the coding language has to be rewritten times because of how it works while apple has ios fully optimised this is coming from ultra user who loves his phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its unworthy upgrade because apple has invented type jack for first time samsung more so how good is the display after few months or so have you encountered green lines on the display or suddenly get those horizontal green lines after updating your phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nonetheless think apple and samsung are great competitors each better in one aspect or the other sam had always had the lead in producing light weight devices but apple has now taken the crown vs apple is always caring more about security and speed unlike sam that covers every aspect well lets see what happens next year remain sam fan nevertheless
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,never in my life dont buy an iphone with the smallest storage and no dont need power more average iphone users charge their phones times per day so it is not very efficient at all
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,crazy how pro got million in antutu score while snapdragon gen got less imag more pm should have gb ram for games
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what is wrong with these trolls that you want to tell people how to use them or how they use their phone its been garbage for long time it should have better fast charging no one cares how you charge it or when the famboys lick shitty boots it is thanks to people like you that these companies have gotten away with it if they continue like this they will soon have to buy the battery or the screen separately and they will continue to lick boots while others fill their pockets
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thats why iphone users charge there phones twice day sure if all you do is sitting nonstop inside the phone no wonder why you need to charge it twice thats logical but you probably havent heard about such thing as logic thinking
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lol next joke please here am getting hour sot in my android and full charge at just more have never had need for charger the midday always put it on charging before bed use brains also iphone always lasts longer than other best android devices
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,they are sure lot efficient but have you ever experienced bootloop after full storage and more never in my life dont buy an iphone with the smallest storage and no dont need powerbank because also look around not just in the screen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,rest you are saying stupid things nah at least know something about new up coming stuff
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,simple sep of all iphone users are dumb enough to believe stuffs they say even the usbc is an more my max pro after year still on
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bionic couldnt beat exynos so dont think so as well bionic nm single core multi core exynos nm btw released months after single core multi core source geekbench so exynos bionic dont think so
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,every company has cult of fanboys be it apple samsung oppo or xiaomi they all consum more yup agree your right but the problem is not being fan its the wrong idea of these people at least of fan base that act like apple is superior and act mighty against someone who has android phone like bro why and im telling you its because of the price like bargaining about their money some people in malaysia and even in my country iran and india literally get loans and even in worst cases sell their kidney for new iphone every year you can see them in the news and still act mighty like bro still have my kidney what are you feeling proud of apples fan base is based on highly addictive consumerism that if you spend more money your higher in class and apple supports and spreads it at the end of the day like apple phones too but ngl dont wanna get in their ecosystem that is toxic with no logical reason
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,of course battery lifespan definitely matters its the concern of most people don more your saying im losing but you defend apple for putting the same charging speed from the last years for dollars phone for its base model official apple pre order price in america and much more expensive in non apple dealers in other countries and when say your apple fanboy you get triggered lol mate you say my words are baseless why dont you go and see how those xiaomi pro and one plus pros from are holding up and the reason is because of their fast charging speed that you dont feel so much pressure not like apple fanboys that are best friends with their lovely dollars apple magsafe power bank after years because their phone takes hours to charge up lol imagine getting robbed by someone and still defend them and even if you want to change the battery of the phones mentioned it will cost you to us dollars with shipping unlike apple that in its official site charges dollars for pro maxs battery without delivery fees if you dont have apple center in your area
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hauwei mate series is much better then iphone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,if it was exynos they have to prepare phone coolers stacked in order to match if its qualcomm then yes if exynos it doesnt since exynos is good in thermals
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,like their attempt of exynos chips dont think so bionic couldnt beat exynos so dont think so as well
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparequalcommsnapdragongenvsappleapro pro is good but only lpddr no httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparemediatekdimensityplusvsappleapro to best smartphone cpu
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,will this be available in johannesburg
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wonderfull device bery beautiful the design is still the same as the previous model very unattractive
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,but pro max is still powerful all just to watch tiktok why bother changing phones every more thats why its called wonderlust lust lust lust lust luuuuust get it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,honestly apple is cheating every single people know people are just foolish samsung more yes and no they kind of cater to different people have had so many bad experiences with products from samsung electronics including phones and monitors lately and alreay years ago that simply dont want to buy any products from them anymore and other android phones arent really enticing at the moment really doesnt give much options on what to choose
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,front camera have ois function did not hear about that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,waiting for samsung ultra
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mark my words the ultra will beat this easily all android phones beats iphone easily waiting to see apple release ifold and fold the companylol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,truth sep why apple and every influencerreviewer lying about new larger sensors main and ultrawide use more of all iphone users are dumb enough to believe stuffs they say even the usbc is an year thing these users will believe usbc on iphone is the best and only one that is fast when they dont even have one packaged with charger let alone charge faster than or even retains battery health not charge longer than any midship android phones imagine year and your iphones battery health is down to let alone years down btw all iphone users shld be experiencing shit battery hold as now is released forcing idiots to upgrade and spend their money to fund apple and to fund for ww
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,regarding the new iphone pro models there havent been many changes so they are not as expensive as the previous models
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,samsung is more powerful like their attempt of exynos chips dont think so
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone doesnt have enough ram thats why its exclusively getting triple games including assassins creed and resident evil go figure
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and due to this fact android destroys ios and due to this those who dont want to accept basic computer science principles which are facts shouldnt even be on here posting
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the design of this latest smart phone is the same as previous model nothing special its boring
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and iphone is still more powerful samsung is more powerful
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what is next for samsung serious is there anything comparable with new beast pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why apple and every influencerreviewer lying about new larger sensors main and ultrawide uses the same sensors from pro max apple said in the presentation for the pro larger mp sensor but they also show micron pixels which is the same size pixels as the pro every video have seen repeated larger sensor except the max tech video which said its the exact same sensor also same with those multiple optical range which is just sensor crop as always apples marketing at its best that is such nasty and cheap lying trick but it works knowing the majority of consumers
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so many reasons to avoid samsung longevity reliability security resale value need say more had nothing but problems with my note actually the best phone have owned was microsoft so sad developers ignored it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the is still good phone yep for yearold like me and for what im coming from its definitely an alright phone imo
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,listen apples ios doesnt take that much ram unlike android gb or ram in an more if the iphone takes you gb of ram instead of on android it doesnt mean that the ios is giving you what android does the iphone is extremely limited in terms of customizing the device you already paid for this include the freedom of having custom roms that fits everyones needs on the top of that you have always pretty much design and the same high price in every new model yes can agree that the iphone build quality is very high but at the end dont need an expensive shiny brick in my pockethands that someone else is telling you how to use im not sheep im customer with money who wants to spend its money and get something instead
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,like the natural titanium color its just so natural
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,because it doesnt need more than that it has whole different operating system androi more lol doesnt need it sooo why not gb ram why not buy camera instead of upgrading camera in the phone it doesnt need higher specifications but ill buy it anyway
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,who cares about ram on phone also sony is super niche phone lol who cares ok so youd buy it with gb ram lmao
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you have never used an iphone lol nor top tier samsung phones you just read the specs on gs more lmao why you so upset about comment where did he say hes never used an iphone you need to calm down you bum
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,think iphone is the best mobile but the price of this phone too much so requiride you make your decision but with heart
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,my ultra has gb ram and is from
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,gb for flagship android next year maybe samsung galaxy ultra gb you have never used an iphone lol nor top tier samsung phones you just read the specs on gsmarena gb ram on iphone is gb ram on android so this gb ram will be equivalent to the gb ram on android lol you bum
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,waiting for iphone super max at thousand dollars
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mp quad pixel pdaf sensorshift ois
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,crappiest smartphone specs in long time for the pro basic model gb ridiculous buy sony xperia and samsung ultra better specs for less
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple and android are great thats all
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,slow charging sultra more goodall
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,compare it with the ultra will choose the galaxy any day imagine what will happen whe more with ultra you no longer get charging cable just like you are buying phones off black market
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,gb in iphone is gb in android gb for flagship android next year maybe samsung galaxy ultra gb
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why the ram is only gb because it doesnt need more than that it has whole different operating system android phones needs more ram but ios does not
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,excellent
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why iphones shy to provide there battary details not even the apple event but final result more keep dreaming
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hahahaha still samsung is on top list
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton sep why is apple hiding the battery capacity and charging speed what stupidity is this god when more no matter what the capacity is it will still outperform any other phone on the market so dont worry nm chip is great however of course if gonna play ac mirage with ray tracing on it dont expect hours that get on pro max currently
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,does your employer not provide you with work phone so you need to buy iphone pro max to more if really have proper corporate job then that means an edicated adult who id guess is above the age of however argue immaturely like year old
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,didnt watch the event did apple present type port as groundbreaking new innovati more android has nothing to do with usb am using iphone pro max before than had iphone and before than iphone point being dont buy androids still have usb cables even some very fast ones and very long ones and braided ones all types of them some bought for ipad pro and around got with various non android peoducts so
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why is apple hiding the battery capacity and charging speed what stupidity is this god when will brand come along that takes these others out of their comfort zone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hold on second why is gsm arena lying about the usbc specification it should be gen more dude gen gen the one with gbs called gen and the one with gbs is called gen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,still watts wireless not even watts wireless another reason to not switch to iphone perfectly agree with you
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you can on flagship android phones for the last good few years multiple phones are even out more you are right
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,me whos getting brand new iphone on the th still grateful tho the is still good phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,gbs use type gen no type use gbs
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,before censored all of them thousands of famous windows phone apps were replaced with we more im not really sure why ton of apps being replaced by web wrappers is googles fault id imagine its mainly other devs who make their apps web wrappers and wouldnt exactly take the claims of other people about google preventing microsoft doing that to be fact think you didnt exactly understand the analogy tried to make so ill try and make it simpler if an app you like suddenly doesnt get updates anymore would it be safer to assume that the developer doesnt want to update the app or that the platform the app was on is forcing them to stop updating it on top of that since you mentioned custom roms that is also often an issue with the manufacturer for not providing source code thats the reason why brands like google have many roms meanwhile brands like samsung and mediatekbased phones usually dont im not really sure of phones that dont let you enter contacts my phones have do so that might have been very rare bug in which you should report if it consists and other people have similar issues dont have the time to look at them right now but im not denying it fastboot isnt the reason people get stuck in fastboot mode its usually caused due to user error while installing custom roms or hardware failure its also not just google thing pretty much every android phone has it and its used to unlock the bootloader its like if claimed that the recovery mode on iphones bricked the device because if theres enough data corruption or hardware failure an iphone will either not boot or be stuck in recovery mode
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ill think about it why did google ban windows phone from having any and all ap more before censored all of them thousands of famous windows phone apps were replaced with web wrappers and five star reviews of people warning other users that google was preventing microsoft from adding apps using google services to their store was one of them no one listened the linux distro analogy is the worst one have ever seen in my entire life machines have bios and uefi which means the user has the right to install whatever they want on arm android devices changing distro is of the time impossible asus tried to create an phone to fight this and they got laughed at just look at xda they are panicking if phone cannot use my contacts its not phone in my book httpsdigitalcontentnextorgwpcontentuploadsdcngoogledatacollectionpaperpdf httpswwwscsstcdiedougleithandroidprivacyreportpdf yes you can theoretically use fastboot on google phones if you want to risk bricking them search google pixel stuck in fastboot mode
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,and you can continue to send work emails on your phone no amount of medicine will save you more not true use my work email via outlook on my own personal iphone and am salesman
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,does it throttle on titanium body we well see in the next weeks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,think about it for second why did google ban windows phone from having any and all apps tha more ill think about it why did google ban windows phone from having any and all apps that used google services such as youtube and force microsoft to shut down lumia im not sure what you mean by ban dont recall google forcefully shutting down any windows phone alternatives if you know of one let me know windows phone was competing os that already didnt have large following it would not have made lot of sense for google to work on apps for dying competition why do of android phones only get months of updates not sure where the number is from but that also depends on the manufacturer for example google provides upwards of years of software updates and brands like fairphone provide far more on the other hand brands like ulefone likely wont provide as many updates which isnt googles fault its the fault of the company for not actually working on updates google doesnt push updates for oxygenos oneui or miui think of it like linux distro if distro you like doesnt get any more updates is it the fault of the developer or the linux foundation why do half of all bugs in android seem to revolve around the function of phone rather than smart phone calls contact syncing etc again im not really sure where youre getting this from maybe you dont use lot of apps and use more of the preinstalled apps on your device but find lot of bugs face come from the incompetence of developers ex discords utter incompetence with their new client why does google collect times more data than apple something that even louis rossmann is furious about that is something have hardly any knowledge of but seems like large number ill have to check louiss video on that because havent seen lot of his pixel videos why do all android phones boast customization but then make it nearly impossible to unlock the bootloader something that figured out years ago its very possible to unlock the bootloader but it depends on the manufacturer for example google makes it very easy to do so just via fastboot but companies like htc and lg required you to get code and some like zte and tcl never let you it can also vary on carrier as some like tmobile wont let you unlock the bootloader unless you ask them
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,enjoy android and ios equally ive been user of both for many years without signific more think about it for second why did google ban windows phone from having any and all apps that used google services such as youtube and force microsoft to shut down lumia why do of android phones only get months of updates why do half of all bugs in android seem to revolve around the function of phone rather than smart phone calls contact syncing etc why does google collect times more data than apple something that even louis rossmann is furious about why do all android phones boast customization but then make it nearly impossible to unlock the bootloader something that figured out years ago think about it or maybe dont you will find the rabbit hole rather unpleasant
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,remember when linus said on live stream that nobody gives damn about outlook so they made more and you can continue to send work emails on your phone no amount of medicine will save you as said if you worked in any corporate environment they will not allow you to log into outlook on your own iphone you dont have job
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nobody gives damn about outlook on phones if thats your reason to spend on ph more remember when linus said on live stream that nobody gives damn about outlook so they made poll and outlook won over gmail to thats you thats how you sound
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no because unlike you dont need two phones to do my job nobody gives damn about outlook on phones if thats your reason to spend on phone you need to get grip also you can stop replying to me you nasty piece of gunk
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,there you go again blaming the manufacturer for issues that happen on any android phone your more blamed asus because asus constantly messes up horribly and has awful pr it would make sense for asus the company that constantly messes up to be at fault than saying google is trying to kill majority of the smartphone industry
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple is best they still use sony sensors mean apple is good love sony phones because of how much control get and the quality of image get
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,exactly this will happen when people compare the iphone pro max vs ultraxiaomi ult more sounds like an aigenerated reply they were comparing with snapdragon on gen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,huawei is best until google services got removed its and im still hoping fo more if huawei wasnt banned wont even care about apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,very confusing first nm chip with six cores and good performance when others are doing nine more and despite that having less cores than the android it manage to run games with some going to hz this ray tracing that was included in the iphone pro max gpu is hardware based and not software base since its using grade titanium wonder how it handles heat
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,snapdragon gen and apple only have month difference try not to look so ridiculous more tf you talking about little boy sit down
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no fm radio haha when iphones had radio
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,link to windows is feature that allows you to get notifications from your androi more does your employer not provide you with work phone so you need to buy iphone pro max to go to work my employer doesnt even let me log on with my own gear only if you actually had job yourself
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,design is boring almost every smartphone nowadays have boring design upgrade
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wake up fanboy apple chipset throttles the most in the video does it throttle on titanium body
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,youre comparing chipset to one totally fair comparison exactly this will happen when people compare the iphone pro max vs ultraxiaomi ultraoppo find pro snapdragon gen of november vs bionic of september
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,boring sht update
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,read what said again didnt say android has malware said android is malware more are you sure thats not just due to asus being incompetent
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,sony innovates samsung does and so does lot of other smartphones for the most part apple more apple is best
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,finally big change com to iphone type
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,every chipset will throttle just that apples will throttle less wake up fanboy apple chipset throttles the most in the video
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,you lie grow up kid learn some facts before saying that someone lied
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,thats why an iphone throttles lot in this video right httpsyoutubedjaerbasi more every chipset will throttle just that apples will throttle less
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,to be honest look kinda ugly to me dnt hate it but rather buy midrange hate the fact that corning made glass never survive drop tests only the crippled huawei phones have strong glass good realme doesnt waste money on gor glass
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,came over to android from an iphone in about honestly cant recall single issue more read what said again didnt say android has malware said android is malware android is malware that turns incredible phones with impressive specs such as the rog phone and turns them into bricks that cant even make phone call without crashing the phone app you dont get malware in android android is the malware
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hi gsmarena team now all four members of apple iphone series are available so please grab these and start reviewing in full detail and its pretty clear that these all members will consume more time but were gonna waiting for non biased and complete reviews thanks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its pity that they changed the analog mute switch to button now there will be possibility of random activation and disabling of the function
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ivo sep no zoom no video no mp sensor dead on arrival yeah dead on arrival because it doesnt have gimmicks sounds like an apple hater to me here
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its pretty good but they stil havent added video recording to it and even the samsung gala more fps is sluggish and takes up lot of space unless you want to cast it to an tv dont see any need in this feature here
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ok post video of your android phone syncing new outlook contact in real time with your wi more how is this unique feature for iphones its literally called link to windows oh btw does anybody actually use these productivity features everyone including you will just use it for texting and web browsing on the go
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple did great with the matte frame one of my least favorite trends about expensive phones was the glossy frame where the paint easily peels off ive only had my plus for year and lot of the paint peeled off resulting in this gross looking phone this matters when youre trying to sell your phone and it looks all messed up nobody wants that that aside also like the curved edges of the phone that helps with the annoying sharp edges the previous iphones had as far as design goes this phone passes in my book
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,is much more sexy than all the iphone series combined king samsung
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its strange to me that what some people loved most about apple was their proprietary usb port would never have imagined that something like that could matter even the least
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bro what are you talking about android has to run on multiple devices everyone with different configurations thats why it would never be perfect on any phone every android phone will have lags glitches and even system errors ios runs only on iphones so the os is the only one optimized with the hardware
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,here thought ill be in love with the telephoto camera but same old shit
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,now iphone is beyond competition thn android it have ois in selfie camera and nm chip more android doesnt make phones its only the name of the operating system
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,like everything except mp res being the default resolution for taking photos part of my job is to upload photos on portals where max size limit is mb which would that either have to download another camera app or resize the photo every single time an unnecessary and bothersome step
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hexa core better than octa nona and deca cores quality over quantity as much as hate apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,optical zoom ultra has
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,well if you have an iphone pro it will be worth the upgrade have one so will do the upgrade
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,does it really have ois in selfie camera
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ultra will take this phone down in its first day of release february please took it down in february
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,oh thank god apple invented usb type they are the best and this is their best invention more ahahahahahaa they invented type cthats the most sarcastic thing ive ever heard ahahah
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,titanium has lower thermal conductivity than aluminium apple and samsung are faked with latest gens of cpu ram and gpu on new gen phones cant wait for the reviews
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,my next phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no zoom no video no mp sensor dead on arrival
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,big ugly punch hole
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why not mention the ram and battery not yet announced well know everything sep
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,only for those who rich enough like president celebrities bosses can buy this type of smartphone they sell for those who not rich like me samsung or xioami will do
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how will google ever recover from this usbc on ios usbc without all the bullshit more they still dont have foldables they still dont have headphone jack and expandable storage anyone oh wait you dont have proper full stage stereo speakers ahhh gotcha but you sure do have the innovative noiseless exmor sensor right oh wait you dont could have seen noise in the low light portrait shot from apples event want me to continue
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,great design every year they innovate they are the king of innovation sony innovates samsung does and so does lot of other smartphones for the most part apple just copies them and market it as first sony has at least world first in each release how about that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what is this everybody has already passed and if not they chose to do so more screen well thats sony exclusive
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lol as if it matters of apple fan boys will buy new phone every year that is the same more of course battery lifespan definitely matters its the concern of most people dont where you got your baseless statistics but im absolutely sure your information about it is incorrect no one is underestimating anyone you might be talking to someone else as never mentioned anything particularly about the consumers as im only referring to battery life your reply is so defensive like you commited heinous crime lol think my words hit you right into your core cause you know what im saying is true anyway you might not notice the decreased battery now but you definitely will in few months the moment you made up the baseless apple fan boys and will sell their kidneys you already lost to me
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,meanwhile other ppl selling their kendney to buy new iphone series
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple is supoused to use titanium frame then why do have stainless steel here what you talking about check it well please
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,still dont get it why people buy device that is called apple mean its like buying car that is called strawberry
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,charging seriously is this for real or is this the norm on iphone that is slower than
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mid as always
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,samsung fanboys crying in the comments about how bad apple is while one ui features ios ri more clearly you dont know what you are commenting if you are saying oneui is apple ios reapof now let me ask you these where did the always on from ios came from if not from android where did apple get its dynamic island idea if not from android check the galaxy note where did ios get the idea of widget from if not from their counterparts android the point is these companies apple samsung google etc follow trend which means an innovation for one is an innovation for all finally to back up my claims samsung is the pioneer of the foldable form factor now look at the number of oems in the foldable segment does it mean those foldables are fold reapof
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,they are lot more power efficient than android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the design is still the same boring and unattractive
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,slow charging watt wirless and watt for wired while other phone can charge with watt mint for full charge bad news about charging
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,as usual in terms of design recycled ugly even physical materials here are recycled for fanatics here they will be hyper excited to have type cwhat its been more than decades by other companieslol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,usbc for the nonpro versions and only for the pro variants my yearold phone has usb
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,for sale kidney to buy iphone series
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,same design years later
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,he said usb which is kinda new so he has point no he has no point as it isnt new to android learn the difference between usb and usbc
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,looks good
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple still couldnt release phone even as sexy as samsung samsung
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mean come on apple no one waited whole year to take class on titanium apple be real although love how apple does its products the quality and the strategies but no its not logic to brag about titanium mean who asked for it
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,anton sep pto overcome something that has been on android phones since end of more like my more he said usb which is kinda new so he has point
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,there was lot different info about pro max and now you changed it so why do you even pos more well thats what happens every year guaranteed specs will be available after release which will be after sep
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yeah finally type iphone what about the charging speed
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,congratulation apple you finally reached great design every year they innovate they are the king of innovation
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,dr watson sep this does make me wonder about something do you think theyll do downgraded version more it was always downgrade gpu on non pros were always weaker even though they carried same name
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,heard about the rumour of the new apple iphone pro max will have mah battery size but im not sure the reality because it is not shown on here and im curious about the new spec sheet and am thrilled to look at this spec sheet once it is ready
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im curious about some thing is it possible using type in iphones improve turtle charging of iphones
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,get grip no seriously enlighten me because genuinely need to know like unless they go back to make android fully open source again or they release fuchsiaos or they replace android entirely with debian and add apk support to it or something insane like that how the fuck can google possibly compete now like at this point theyre gonna need to make fucking phone just to generate market share from thin air
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no you wont can drain my sultra in easily less than day normal usage and that has more can see you have no clue about smartphones especially iphones they are lot more power efficient than android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,do since hate opting sim card or memory card on slot as well some models dont pr more for what on earth would you need tb on damn phone you plan to use it like years and take videos every week if you are vlogger you need pc man trust me it would be much better to store your videos on computer or on an external hdd
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yes you will get minimum days of battery life even with full fledged usage no you wont can drain my sultra in easily less than day normal usage and that has same battery life as pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,so no tb version after all by the way most of the people do not need so much of space do since hate opting sim card or memory card on slot as well some models dont provide memory card slot then need larger space for internal storage do actually hope theyll release several model from entry level to flagship with at least tb internal storage to the market asap if not this year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nm soc with gpu that handle ps level games hands down apple and good luck more dude the gen gpu already crushed and is only improvement gen gpu is supposed to be about faster than gen so will destroy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,superior than who than iphone lmao iphone pro apple is more powerful than snp more no apple cpu is slightly more powerful apple gpu gets crushed by gen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,these actually ended up looking really good it is surprising to see that the colors werent so grey after all im sucker for blue and the blue titanium actually looks pretty amazing
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,usb type no fast aka thunderbolt
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,justachoccookie sep the processor of the pm is now called pro this does make me wonder about something do you think theyll do downgraded version of the pro call it just bionic and slap it in the vanilla iphone next year that would be an interesting strategy for better or for worse
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,not even single new feature what big disappointment
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why we specifically see samsung vs apple fanboys rather than android vs ios like when was the last time you saw someone with google or oneplus is samsung users for some reason and to think that the best smartphone is such nonsense expression dont even know who are worse smartphone fanboys or sports fans yall just pathetic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the pro looks exciting but the camera though is it just me or the photo samples didnt look all that good especially the photos they seemed bit oversharpened and noisy
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,like what the hell its sep today yet no specification leaks lol you have to wait
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,yes they abailable on cant wait for it and the rest of all iphone series right shut ups users
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the processor of the pm is now called pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,would buy it but its just usd in norway
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,does it finally have variable zoom up to
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,surely the data on the telephoto camera is incorrect in the event they said its mmx of course it gould be digital zoom for some reason but even then the sensor size seems unrealistic
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,just watching my iphone will lose its value by dollars
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,wtf how can anyone say something bad about samsung or apple they are both good wtf how can the apple fanboys say that samsug is shit if their iphone just is or samsug but that doesnt makes it besseror worse also samsunghas its good stuff and apple wtf is wrong with these fanboys how could this comment get go from the moderators here poor gsmarenasadly
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mins of daily charging in exchange of short battery lifespan due to more heat from the fa more lol as if it matters of apple fan boys will buy new phone every year that is the same and costs more from last year and they will sell their kidney for it too dont underestimate empty brain consumers that only buy phones for its name btw im using watt fast charging on my mid range phone for years and shortened battery life is unnoticeable btw dont use my phone while charging and while gaming get the phone out of the case so it doesnt get hot and make sure its up to date and delete the cash and unnecessary apps every week and restart it once every week if your treat your phone carefully it will be in its peak condition for years and after that just change my phone for or dollars
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,same design same everything for last years good job apple and yes they did upgrade the cpu and camera but guess what every company does that at the end of the day only thing apple did was raising the price for ultra moderl that does nothing more and apple fans still buy it im seeing angry iphone fans after reading this post
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,battery life will be insane almost mah and mah more than pro max previous iphones more who gives flying facck still an apple
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,damn mah if so thiss gonna last so much longer yes you will get minimum days of battery life even with full fledged usage

Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the mp periscope its new sensor its not new but good one for periscope camera already iphone used this sensor as main camera on pro max vanilla it has huge pixel um approximately
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,new huawei already use this sensor for years this apple iphone very modern brand lol they havent fast chargew today very slow charge
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,oh my god wonder what its gonna look like
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,deep purple alright
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,iphone pro max ultra except this phone be number phone for several years more expect the iphone pro max to be the best at whatever it is the best at and for me it isnt the best in terms of size for one for exactly one year until the iphone pro max comes out
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,they basically changed nothing every successor of phone will have change even minor ones count
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,but yuki cant run my one legacy application that im assuming everybody must more if you are on android and can live with linux you can use andronix or install any desktop linux distro through termux you can still find arm versions of popular linux desktop software like openoffice and gimp to name just two if you still need to rely on windows or are currently an ios user you might want to check out windows
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,every camera have lens flare due to reflection or lens shape and does not even bother to use coating to reduce
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,same sensor fro pro max why should upgrade the mp periscope its new sensor
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,still does not fix the bootloop issue whenever they ran out of storage
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hope this pro series camera dont produce huge lens flare like pro series let more every camera have lens flare due to reflection or lens shape
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,what is your particular usecase of it maybe you dont use laptop yes dont use my laptop very often since started using desktop mode on my android phones particularly samsung dex huawei emui desktop and lg screen even without desktop mode can easily screen mirrorcast my phone to an external display with cable despise wireless screen casting because it lags so much and produce more heat than cable thats why deeply value wired video output on modern smartphones modern smartphones of today has become so powerful that it can easily be the only computer an average consumers ever need
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,should have hz amoled with gb ram and mp camera apple used to be ahead of the pack bu more the only thing that makes sense from what you said was the hz part even that would drain the battery faster gb ram mp there is limit to how much ram soc can handle at once and even if the chip actually could handle that much ios doesnt need that much its well optimized os and same goes for the camera theres limit to how much soc can handle well hate to break it to you but gb ram and mp camera might just be the result of wild imagination lets keep it in the realm of possibility shall we
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,from iphone pro max to pro max you will get connectivity always on display more apple started putting hz refresh rate displays from the iphone pro and pro max
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,why apple use number on screen what is the secret any smartphones use special numbers first iphone announced by steve jobs at
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,can disable battery health option in new ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,how much rams on your phone empty thanks
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,boring design not gonna buy it its boring for reason
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,its just renamed iphone pro max will rather stick to my current phone than to upgrade to pro max because its just waste of resources
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,display at least or inch would be better considering the renamed big notch poking aka dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,no way apple will rule the world thats rude nm with bionic horrible
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,lets see how much this new gen flops looks like theres nothing really new the typical new chip and camera improvements but thats it and judging by the previous cameras expect it to be behind the android flagships as always still no design changes so its still unpleasant to hold and apple want to increase the price too heard which dont understand how they have the audacity to think they are able to justify that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the rear and selfie cameras are very low go for xiaomi redmi note pro
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,apple has low cameraquick charging
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,bet body would be machined titanium instead
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,few minor improvements like chipset and camera latest ios out of the box higher price and yet it will sell more than any other phone
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,can post pic of pro still looks same nah thatll be misleading
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,they afraid people think iphone is cheap product so they made the predecessor and successor at same design
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,ahh shit here we go again
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,does the keyboard have separate number row or is it still same as the previous ones this the only reason why didnt buy another iphone since bought iphone plus
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,same phone as the previous one just different name and insignificant changes
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,type can support displayport alt mode to transfer high res content on bigger screen know but you can guarantee this phone isnt going to support that
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,im gonna upgrade my ip plus to pro max this year
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,displayport type can support displayport alt mode to transfer high res content on bigger screen
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,used to use iphone before but shifted to android now the only reason would buy iphone was the camera iphone is not as versatile as android
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,still no fast charge
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hope they will build california orange iphone pro max is too big
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,always loved phones that are light thin and without notch that ship clearly is sailed
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,am an android fan the only thing that is making me buy the iphone pro max is the bezels ty more well that didnt age well
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,spec will change soon
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,cant wait for the newest iphones hope they had more colors on the pro max models
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,waiting to confirm the specs during the official launch expected to be on tuesday september
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,sure hope apple doesnt cheap out on the amount of ram again by only giving gb instead of gb is fine for now but these phones are supposed to last like years and apps and especially the web are only getting heavier memory swap like desktops would actually be breakthrough feature for ios ipados has it as far as know so why not ios
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,periscope
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,the goat is back
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,te king is back
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,without fingerprint
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,nice specs
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,displayport
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,hope so be the best one
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,classic apple move tonnes of other new stuff they could add but theyre just saving it for the next gens lol
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,same than iphone pro max the actual specs hasnt been released yet and youre making assumptions
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,haters gonna hate
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,maybe something new because they tell ultra
Apple,iPhone 15 Pro Max,mp ultrawide camera who made that sensor because never heard of this before about the periscope camera the rumors where telling or am curious what is the truth
Apple,iPhone 16,they dont even run slower trough the years people are buying cheap androids and then more had an for years one ui lagged so bad would pull the notification panel and it would appear seconds latermoreover it would not hold more than hours of sot per day and heated up like hell doing mundane tasks such as tiktok on
Apple,iPhone 16,the iphone is great phone dont get me wrong but heres the catch nice case that will ha more bro does not know how to take care of phone just say you have dropped it carelessly ive had mine for months with zero scratches or cracks
Apple,iPhone 16,actually like this one the most this year the pro reaching grams is pushing it too far more yk androids with hz exist for less
Apple,iPhone 16,come to see the camera review of the after reading the one from the ie where was the reviewer of the ie when the was tested the difference in tone is like night and day for what are similar experiences here the has an excelent camera but the ie has camera that works surprisingly where does the truth lie
Apple,iPhone 16,the ghz screen is noticeable theres lot of tearing of words when you scroll fast it hurts your eyes initially then youll get use to it after few days however if you use any other phone thats faster daily with the iphone youll never get use to the tearing its such waste to have ghz on otherwise beautifully made phone
Apple,iPhone 16,have an iphone and it does not support reverse wireless charging
Apple,iPhone 16,imo its great release for someone coming from an older iphone like the the colours more since ios camera on is trash beware they updated something and now photos come blurry also doubt you will like ios new photos app which is the worst photo viewer had seen since the age of nokia symbian phones
Apple,iPhone 16,highly disagree with the notion foliage and grass look very convincing would go as far as say those look very unconvincing grass literally looks like bunch of white worms ppl use as fishing bait sorry think journalists and respectable tech blogs like yours should tell the truth straight into the apples face postprocessing is trash period aggressive noise reduction paired with oversharpening one hadnt seen since the galaxy note days is ruining the natural image coupled with very cheap looking autohdr that is now impossible to turn off on iphones you get strange image doubling artifacts like in the one of the building images in your blogpost you are my only hope you must tell people the truth that iphones no more produce beautiful and natural images back in the days fell for this marketing scam and bought iphone pro honestly worst phone purchase ever not only my screen was defective and died in years but also photos were always very blurry and overly noise reduced raw doesnt help as well as takes lot of time to perfect shot that would have been otherwise ruined with apples processing algorithms
Apple,iPhone 16,its worth mentioning that at least this vanilla iphone is not needlessly as big or as he more xperia
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone is very well programmed and ios is very well integrated with iphone video files in more first of you do realise that unless youre getting the higher tier with more storage you cant record videos only if you connect an external ssd hence spending more although do admit that their video capabilities are second to none secondly have no proof as to whether they are more efficient that their android counterparts or not but what can say for sure is that it consumes about the same power with the samsung ultra vs genshin impact and it does heat up more than the ultra most times those nice features are what makes android android its the same reason why there are people are still rooting for android so whats stopping apple from implementing those nice features and see what android fans would have to say
Apple,iPhone 16,samsung still the best phone in the world
Apple,iPhone 16,well deserved score not much new this just shows new iphone models shouldnt be relea more nonsense you just found my need to upgrade every year
Apple,iPhone 16,they compared the iphone to other compact flagships useless youre stuck in the ios more yeah my point is they reviewed this phone in vacuum their alternative phones are still other iphones which is just dumb
Apple,iPhone 16,know for fact since ive been using android phones for years what is it with apple boys masquerading as android users just to say iphones are better
Apple,iPhone 16,do you deliberately delude yourself into thinking only iphones work know for fact since ive been using android phones for years
Apple,iPhone 16,useless or partially useful feature rich phones arent iphones competitors there com more do you deliberately delude yourself into thinking only iphones work
Apple,iPhone 16,they dont lag they are just running slower through the years they dont even run slower trough the years people are buying cheap androids and then complain it runs slow well yeah of course it does lol its cheap phone if you buy an android for the same price as an iphone it will run flawlessly ive never had problem with samsung series but had problems with cheaper ones wich is totaly logical so this all androids lag talk has to stop good ones dont bad ones do through time as simple as that
Apple,iPhone 16,huge improvement over its predecessor in camera and battery life
Apple,iPhone 16,iphones dont lag use an android and it was good last months now it freezes on everything more they dont lag they are just running slower through the years
Apple,iPhone 16,finally phone thats so revolutionary its almost indistinguishable from last yea more you can say the same thing about of the smartphones nowadays
Apple,iPhone 16,apple copied sonys design for their xperia phones from last year just like almst every other thing from them wow what truly innovative company sony should really sue them for stealing their design for their xperia phones from last year to earn some money back and to show the world that they are actually the ones that deserve to be one of the best companies if not the best in the whole world because they are the ones who were pushing the smartphone market to new heights with their innovations water reaistance first video capture many more and not crapple
Apple,iPhone 16,nope good battery life on iphones doesnt outweigh the fact that iphones have ancient ch more where did mention charging speeds im talking about power efficiency
Apple,iPhone 16,mine has hrr paid for but it has no use to me if it had native hz it would be more oh no few bucks wasted so if youre only focusing on hrr whys the hz iphone at least cool more than some hz droids
Apple,iPhone 16,this mah battery will need charging less than the xiaomi pro mah lmao nope good battery life on iphones doesnt outweigh the fact that iphones have ancient charging speeds
Apple,iPhone 16,small battery mah category needs to be recharged very often only gb ram more this mah battery will need charging less than the xiaomi pro mah lmao
Apple,iPhone 16,you can still find everything you mentioned there in android phones all xperia phones still more iphone is very well programmed and ios is very well integrated with iphone video files in iphone take up half the size or less compared to similar files in android and no other smartphone can compete with iphone in shooting videos apple processors are so efficient that they consume atleast lesser power than other chips to do the same tasks hence more tasks per watt dont be that blind to see that iphone has always been an allrounder even if it meant that it didnt have all the nice to have features
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone looking bad iphone is better than in looking
Apple,iPhone 16,hz display gb storage cameras sounds like an entrybudget phone from years ag more hz display gb storage cameras hz display way more important to people who read sites like this than it is to everyday folk gb storage like much of the market only cameraswell you have point there come apple how hard is it to throw one of those crappy mp depth cameras on the back and then say there are cameras that particular trick has been working wonders in the android world for years heck if were apple would not have bothered giving the ultrawide camera autofocus capability at all and instead gone with the mp macro thing as well could have said they had cameras then
Apple,iPhone 16,release of new model once every years would be bit much every year is just silly
Apple,iPhone 16,hz screen and no camera on flagship that costs and up in is hil more video from phones actually look worse than and take up ton of space while nobody has screens anyway you are basically chasing spec sheet numbers for no good reason here iphones come with better battery life every year and thats lot more useful to of people im personnaly tempted to switch from su to pro for the similar battery life and camera quality in reasonably compact phone no apple intelligence in europe is annoying though
Apple,iPhone 16,as soon as saw gsmarena said the photo is excellent stop reading lol because you know better
Apple,iPhone 16,you can do that on the cheapest android so could also put the question what does ipho more iphones dont lag use an android and it was good last months now it freezes on everything try to do with it
Apple,iPhone 16,android used to have several unique selling points over iphone such as better battery life more add to the list price cheaper repairing hz customizing everything live wallpapers are must for me aod real widgets dex as someone said before me can you name all things in iphone that you cant live without
Apple,iPhone 16,bezels are huge
Apple,iPhone 16,yeah and you can get the pros for cheaper now dont see the point in not buying th more just checked the apple store you cant even buy the pro now the only models available are se and pro
Apple,iPhone 16,for years battery life was iphones achilles heel but this year iphone comes top surprising
Apple,iPhone 16,just the pros yeah and you can get the pros for cheaper now dont see the point in not buying those unless theyre ridiculously expensive still or arent available for some reason the base iphones seem like cashgrabs to me for people who were stoopid enough to get em lolololol
Apple,iPhone 16,availability for one weight as well finally design colors for me the first are important pro in natural titanium weighs just grams more looks better than the new candy colors imo and is not that much higher in prices now due to discounts the inventory for pro models are running out though per apple usual mo of discontinuing older pro models
Apple,iPhone 16,what seriously thought the pros are gonna get ai just the pros
Apple,iPhone 16,wow worse than iphone gsmarena review score iphone vs iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,apple intelligence is not available in poland no thanks apple
Apple,iPhone 16,the older iphones wont get apple intelligence which is lot of bs from apple what seriously thought the pros are gonna get ai
Apple,iPhone 16,battery life is just wow especially if you take the small battery into account the xz compact is imo the only small battery capacity android smartphone mah with such an amazing battery life
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone was the most expensive hz screen phone in the world before iphone came out now we have new king of hz so now iphone owners should be proud and feel themselves happy my congratulations to them
Apple,iPhone 16,why not buy an older iphone pro instead of this im genuinely curious oh and specific for this generation chip and possibly software support also everything that comes with it like modem camera button camera software features photographic styles wifi wireless charging speed battery life
Apple,iPhone 16,gsmarena have become lol rating website hth iphone gets rating only where many so more if you have not yet think about it one of the key factors in the rating is the price and this phone is asking more than some other chinese flagshipsfor example op is euros less than base twice the storage dedicated zoom camera usb faster charging hz higher res display for the money that apple asks for base is completly fair
Apple,iPhone 16,actually prefer the camera tuning of the realme pro the filter for the skies seems to be little dark on this iphone but its clear how the processor is maximising the cameras performance here just look at the captured details even passing birds snapped in the stills do not appear blurry and the finest whisps of clouds are clearly depicted
Apple,iPhone 16,apple will probably kill the surprisingly competitive battery life with the next couple of updates
Apple,iPhone 16,yeah but call test alone being hours worse thats insane how it doesnt make any sense call battery tests are unreliable since there are several factors that can affect it without it the difference is barely around an hour hour and half which is understandable given the is but cut down vs the pro battery results from many reviewers across the whole iphone line show very strong results
Apple,iPhone 16,lmao how is it possible that it has higher geekbench than but it loses on more geek bench is updated every year around iphone releases which mysteriously decreases all android scores and boosts only apple scores apple loses to even midrange snapdragons and mediateks in all other tests
Apple,iPhone 16,both have cores same cores small cores of pro are clocked ghz higher gpu has an more yeah but call test alone being hours worse thats insane how it doesnt make any sense
Apple,iPhone 16,if highest end bezels were micrometer and iphone bezels were micrometer youd still say more and also no problem for everyday use at all
Apple,iPhone 16,lets go to bezel town if highest end bezels were micrometer and iphone bezels were micrometer youd still say omg bezels so big you could land plane on them theyre not as bad as some make it out to be
Apple,iPhone 16,can someone explain to me why pro has hour worse battery life than regular they have more both have cores same cores small cores of pro are clocked ghz higher gpu has an extra core maybe higher clocked too bit larger screen ltpo could not help since only drops below hz when person does not touch screen during this test it can only help video playback pro max score bit more than may pass it
Apple,iPhone 16,no design uglier than other except pixel series durability pro max breaks more went to my carrier weeks ago to switch to esim they told me not to do because signal gets weaker and you believed it guess you also believe causes cancer or what
Apple,iPhone 16,call test my bad it doesnt make any sense yeah why would higher end phone have worse rf components
Apple,iPhone 16,you can say that about every phone lol for the price of this iphone show me similar device more xiaomi samsung even samsung want more devices
Apple,iPhone 16,note that this is the ceramic shield second generation the one on the iphone pro models and not the new third generation that premiered with the iphone pro whatever you are hallucinating here iphone including the pro models have ceramic shield iphone and pro has ceramic shield
Apple,iPhone 16,would prefer aluminium backs like on iphones long ago these colours look plastic and childish also dont like the way the colour is dyed into the glass around the camera bump
Apple,iPhone 16,yeah it is up to the user not the maker because fyi androids arent locked at hz more mine has hrr paid for but it has no use to me if it had native hz it would be cheaper
Apple,iPhone 16,hz sot hz sot your phones can last days it is up to you yeah it is up to the user not the maker because fyi androids arent locked at hz even keep mine at hz all the time so apples lack of features is not feature
Apple,iPhone 16,the hz display helps with the battery life wow man apple fans claim the lack of features is feature itself you know hz androids arent locked at that refresh rate right keep my own redmi at hz all the time even though it is hz
Apple,iPhone 16,this unreleased feature they promised us is really good not that it exists yet but they bumped the hardware so it must be really good
Apple,iPhone 16,for gb version is insane hz screen still no photos or videos and gb of more relax youre trying to compare ps to tesla dojo
Apple,iPhone 16,does all the basics well excellent main camera excellent screen personally dont car more look at the xiaomi series or upcoming series they are compact and better specs
Apple,iPhone 16,very impressive battery life and sustainedperformance and decent screen brightness the rest is the same story every year with iphones last but not least as much as hate hz screens on this price range would definitely pick iphone over exynos
Apple,iPhone 16,how only cause its the same device with minimal changes for lot of money you can say that about every phone lol for the price of this iphone show me similar device which has good battery life does not throttle by and has takes both good quality photos and video something those chinese phone makers forget people take all while being compact or at least reasonably sized
Apple,iPhone 16,from the comments here youd think that it was complete budget display its actually an excellent display in terms of the actual display quality the brightness color accuracy and resolution are top notch and according to gsmarena it offers the best hdr implantation assume this is typo and is meant to be implementation weve seen so far just lacking in hz but its fairly top level in many other areas
Apple,iPhone 16,kinda feels like gsma has conformed to all the apple hate that live on this website seem more wouldnt call star rating an excellent phones most phones get over it shows that despite having some strengths the weaknesses are overwhelming
Apple,iPhone 16,really good batterylife camera and overall top performance also video out usbdp not to more the hz display helps with the battery life
Apple,iPhone 16,the new iphone is once again pioneer in sturdiness thanks to an improved ceramic shield glass so why so often seen people with cracked glassfront andor back on their iphones but other than that the iphone is shaping as one of the hottest compact phones of the season nope pixel series is still hotter literally due to amazing chip they use xd
Apple,iPhone 16,great cameras and photovideo quality very good battery life amazing performance nice compa more only con is the biggest con especially considering the price and how is it bit too high as mentioned before
Apple,iPhone 16,star is bit too high considering hz and its price star is more reasonable
Apple,iPhone 16,the phone excels in every damn category other than the hz nonsense this is champion phon more too bad apple decided to go backwards in design apple somehow managed to make the camera island looks worse than the same layout on the and xs
Apple,iPhone 16,hrs enduranceweridfrom what hav seen on yt videos battery comparison rhe ultra and other nadroids battery lasr longer than ip by large margin
Apple,iPhone 16,oh great does all the basics for thanks apple didnt say it was cheap still point is there are not many alternatives with similar size weight and similar in the areas mentioned in the android camp maybe the but just not much choice for compact light flagship level phones given the vast number of phones available
Apple,iPhone 16,more phone than of the people need apple ios and face id are still much easier to use than what android offers the biggest negative of this phone is the existence of the pro models
Apple,iPhone 16,theres no way apples using that awful of sensor for their uw camera with measly pixel size of micron pixels and zero binning its miracle its able to conjure up usable images at night at all dont even want to know how small the sensor is
Apple,iPhone 16,because gb is cpu only antutu has made it clear on their website that cross platform comparis more think it was toms guide that made for review test with video editing iphone pro max completed task something like faster than latest samsung
Apple,iPhone 16,wow the exynos is kinda better on gpu
Apple,iPhone 16,often urge people to buy last years pro such as but heard those have thermal issues the thermal issues were quickly fixed last year like within days think it was an issue with instagram
Apple,iPhone 16,hz screen and no telephoto for is daylight robbery
Apple,iPhone 16,this especially when all of the full features are not available yet often urge people to buy last years pro such as but heard those have thermal issues
Apple,iPhone 16,in europe the base iphone costs the outrageous price of euro you really must be diehard apple fan to swallow these prices
Apple,iPhone 16,main gripes with people on this website with iphones is mainly hz and the os to be fair more this especially when all of the full features are not available yet
Apple,iPhone 16,weve had the same cons list for couple of generations now
Apple,iPhone 16,so they made changes to rf components and they made changes to frequency governor
Apple,iPhone 16,that battery life wipes the floor with some phones with mah batteries
Apple,iPhone 16,only google pixel series use new oled but old info say pixel and apple use new oled
Apple,iPhone 16,those that do not know main camera of iphones use exmor
Apple,iPhone 16,so iphone gb will have similar price to iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,what cant stand particularly in ios is animations its sluggish they give some more think you might be able to switch it off in the accessibility motion section have the iphone with ios and so think it may be the same you can access this easily by going to settings and then the search box enter animated youll find something listed called autoplay animated images and this is the section called accessibility motion then just untick the three autoplay options those three are regards animated images in and effects in messages
Apple,iPhone 16,so apple copying samsung design samsung copying apple design and everyone copying the mighty realme
Apple,iPhone 16,hey switched from the hz screen of the nothing phone to the iphone hz scre more what cant stand particularly in ios is animations its sluggish they give some weight in every scroll and movement maybe it was fun years ago but not its really annuinng at least they should give option to remove the toggle lower anilation is joke on my samsung animation is at zero in dev mode its super snappy just few animation left over but ive put factor at max speed but well its apple thats what rarely buy many people like that gadgetry to me its just anoyance making things more slow and more complicated its nothing smart even raspberry pi at can do animation it even looks cheesy no it well maybe in years again apple and peoples mind will change
Apple,iPhone 16,lol the rating is prob for apple standards
Apple,iPhone 16,mre jul repairability class class my fixed phones that has labe class and they are ea more rating in repair in apple standards
Apple,iPhone 16,is it rational to buy an iphone in depends
Apple,iPhone 16,is this phone overheat easily iphones rarely overheat due to the apple ecosystem and chipset optimisation thats why the battery lasts long even tho its small
Apple,iPhone 16,current price and gb gb gb prices have found on amazoncom
Apple,iPhone 16,why can an iphone record videos at fps when it has just hz display so it cant more saying that is not smart being able to record high fps video is great option the screen is hz but high fps means you can enjoy slowmotion in video editing although in daily usage more than is not really effective
Apple,iPhone 16,repairability class class my fixed phones that has labe class and they are easy to fix compared to iphone esp changing used or new parts this should be reparability more than
Apple,iPhone 16,is better buy iphone pro or iphone which iphone is lighter in hand think iphone more iphone better in hand
Apple,iPhone 16,so over all is the iphone worth to buy yes it worth it if you want to buy you can also order from me to do that or content me on my telegram account for more information
Apple,iPhone 16,received the iphone today but notice the glass screen is not flush with the casing is this something new that apple invented looks and feels strange to me
Apple,iPhone 16,people who are used to hz refresh rate find hz acceptable please mention your experienc more hey switched from the hz screen of the nothing phone to the iphone hz screen before the purchase was worried about the overall feel of the hz screen and the fact that ive gotten used to the hz display of the nothing phone but after switching the optimized and smooth transitions of the animations of the os and the fact that almost every app use is welloptimized to the os it ended up being more than acceptable and not annoying at all of course here and there the lack of the extra hz is noticeable but of the time barely notice it
Apple,iPhone 16,hi have been using pro which bought refurbished for past two years should upgrade more if you really feel the need to upgrade your phone try to see if you can find refurbished iphone pro for around the same price as that will be better phone then the if you cant find one then get the but be prepared to be using phone with hz screen hope this helps
Apple,iPhone 16,used pro vs brand new which is better overall camera battery have both dont play heavy games nor lot of photos battery life is better on the iphone in normal use phone calls photos no difference im happy with both phones
Apple,iPhone 16,gb just fyi the pro also has gb ram
Apple,iPhone 16,honestly anyone considering this phone should just buy the iphone pro youll get more gb
Apple,iPhone 16,which country pro and same price difference about usd and dont know about new more here in canada both are basically the same price and in many cases the pro is actually about cad cheaper than the and although to get that price you have to go refurbished would easily recommend buying refurbished phone if it means significantly better experience hope this helps
Apple,iPhone 16,was always iphone user back in with iphone decided to try android to figure out more what nonsense everything bas experience applies to iphone he is telling user experience of
Apple,iPhone 16,is better in camera and battery are right
Apple,iPhone 16,it amizing
Apple,iPhone 16,you can literally buy ultra by its price
Apple,iPhone 16,even phones nowadays stills has ads on your os ridiculous ur limited to pixelapplenothin more custom rom it
Apple,iPhone 16,apple is always gonna be more user friendly linux is made to be free most of the reason us more even phones nowadays stills has ads on your os ridiculous ur limited to pixelapplenothing and others that has clean software as your choice if wanted no ads experience
Apple,iPhone 16,this but with ltpo hz and hopefully even lighter weight galaxy pulled ahead at add and thats it that should be iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone didnt wow me after days packed and returned just found it rather boring
Apple,iPhone 16,dont like iphones but one thing do like is how apple is keeping the small phone alive find me one under inch brand new phone and then come back to me if you think this isnt small nowadays
Apple,iPhone 16,finding the right iphone cover is essential to keep it safe from scratches and daily wear the antiscratch technology in these covers is great innovation ensuring longlasting protection while maintaining the phones sleek look its always exciting to see how accessories evolve to match the latest devices on related note many apple fans are already looking ahead to the next launch get the latest insights on the iphone pro max launch and upcoming apple innovations
Apple,iPhone 16,ppl saying that iphones hz feels smoother than android hz had never used hz device mean refresh rate arent just numbers maybe you feel hz smoother cuz of the animations but at the end hz is smoother own iphone and iphone but they dont feel smoother than my realme which costs around inr
Apple,iPhone 16,no you cant perhaps be more specific with my queries
Apple,iPhone 16,phone is great have been using android devices with hz refreshe rate since they came out and have to admit dont miss hz because this phone goes way smoother than android devices battery lasts for two days with the one charge get more than hours on screen time pretty happy with my first iphone ever planing to use it for at least to years and if am lucky maybe more good day everyone
Apple,iPhone 16,hz in is absolutely ridiculous even tho is saves some energy it just feels less smooth hope they will change the max refresh rate to atleast hz on base iphone models and change the design and give camera lens on base iphone and camera lens on iphone models usbc is also crazy in on base flagship models even ultra has usbc and this model was relased almost years before iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,way smoother than many hz androids this is how you know smart people
Apple,iPhone 16,usbc only seriously
Apple,iPhone 16,what up people so what do you think se or this one think you should buy the one via idealo lowest price because it has the better cam and mag safe for just about but the one ist definetly fine
Apple,iPhone 16,save few get new se hope it will be hz
Apple,iPhone 16,wow will buy one soon
Apple,iPhone 16,to the people arguing about this having hz yup its true currently im using more yes was using android on side as second phone got samsung it got but still iphone hz is better then android
Apple,iPhone 16,best compact phone in the planet
Apple,iPhone 16,hrs battery scores why see all yt channels most even exynos beats ip in battery despite having much lower scored by gsma
Apple,iPhone 16,you probably dont understand refresh rate hz displays will output hz and hz more bro but still the games that supports fps would run on fps in hz screenlike genshin impactdevil may cryin android these games supports on fps even if you have elite but when you moves to iphone pro models with hz screenthese games allow you to play in fpsthere is huge difference thanif you go with simple vanilla iphonesfps you gotwhat is the benefit of using powerful chipset who let you play pc aaa titles but not supports fps even in bgmi
Apple,iPhone 16,you have iphones he doesnt
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone buyers are not stupid just because they bought hz iphone iphone is one of th more way smoother than many hz androids
Apple,iPhone 16,its ok except poor battery lots of features but poor battery ruins it they did it again you have iphones
Apple,iPhone 16,beautiful phone only complaint would be the mediocre battery life
Apple,iPhone 16,after loading this phone with everything possible yet still no good selfie camera and batterysomtimes wonder how they come up with such innovation
Apple,iPhone 16,not upto date handset too costly as the new model poor service waiting
Apple,iPhone 16,get that hz is slow especially for people who are used to or hz but came from hz and after living on that for months didnt even realize how bad it was until got hz when the screen cracked
Apple,iPhone 16,galaxy from correct me if the year is wrong has an oled despite it being ye more did not know it was my dad had one up until
Apple,iPhone 16,apple believers would buy even hz iphone they really are something else did this but at least learned from it im coming from blackviews worst year for them think they dont show it but swer my old phone had hz
Apple,iPhone 16,ehem coming from hz notice its useless for what need hz for that prefer to more no use hz can tell its flawless scrolling fastwhen used ip felt slow facts is all
Apple,iPhone 16,no need drama people like me can tell that dont need and dont care thing battery life good connection and reliability are my priorities so sold my pro for bucks bought and im happy
Apple,iPhone 16,and still has hz strange that even older phones like the fe also had hz super more the average consumer wont care about hz the usp of the pro models is having hz apple want to upsell of their customers into buying the more expensive models duh
Apple,iPhone 16,why gsm arena is hiding refresh rate of this prehistoric display cause it would be obvious it more read with country accent oh im still rocking with hz
Apple,iPhone 16,phone with hz should be illegal in apple believers would buy even hz iphone they really are something else
Apple,iPhone 16,im getting the in white or ultramarine and hopefully the battery is good lasting full day so no complains
Apple,iPhone 16,this cellphone takes its design from the sony xperia mark
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone still hz there is no info here yes its still at hz
Apple,iPhone 16,same battery life as iphone pro max in httpswwwgsmarenacombatterytestvphp apple silicon is insane
Apple,iPhone 16,you surely must have dreamt it as samsung galaxy as doesnt exist reading comprehension is sorely missed skill in
Apple,iPhone 16,grandson because you wanted an phone with hz screen you said no one ever more galaxy from correct me if the year is wrong has an oled despite it being years older
Apple,iPhone 16,why base iphone have better colors or its just me when pro line colors always look dull and boring sad apple stopped colourful pro iphones when ippro came with titanium we deserve colours like on the pro pros
Apple,iPhone 16,hz display in realy its not budget gaming phone my xr can run call of du more yes its thing that first came to iphone at the pro generations have came from it pro tip for apple look at like galaxy or
Apple,iPhone 16,this is because the refresh rate is only hz and the battery endurance results are based on more dont think so the samsung galaxy as display has refresh rate of only hz and resolution of yet the endurance score is which is still lower than the iphone at
Apple,iPhone 16,they were comparing the samsung to the base model iphone its ridiculous comparison more you forget something called user experience the unlocking experience on iphone is far superior than using fingerprint scanner it works everytime other than that switched from an much better specs to an iphone and im happier with iphone how do you explain that ill tell you better user experience and no im not an apple fanboy had much more androids than iphones
Apple,iPhone 16,the chip is good but why compromise the experience with hrtz and ufs storage
Apple,iPhone 16,would iphone be ok for beginner new to ios battery like new sure had the pro max and it was great phone it still receives the same software support as the iphone as long as your battery is solid you should be good
Apple,iPhone 16,even although im samsung fan definitely the iphone although recommend getting the pro mod more it actually charges fast though no joke
Apple,iPhone 16,yall wait for the iphone and air because base model iphone next year will finally have hz ltpo display you can check it on macrumors toms guide pocketlint and news bytes
Apple,iPhone 16,stop talking about hz disabled it to save battery life the person you replied to never mentioned anything about the phones refresh rate also thats bad excuse not everybody needs the extra little juice
Apple,iPhone 16,great the new iphone is here hopefully this thime the battery life will last for more than an more stop talking stupid things
Apple,iPhone 16,at least hz should have given it feels bad and dated hz for that much money wtf it should be at least hz
Apple,iPhone 16,the hz screen makes your eye tired coming from hz phones other than that issue its very fast phone with the ideal size and weight prefer ios over android so android phones arent going to work for me
Apple,iPhone 16,why laptops are pretty useless except for schoolwork and maybe occasional gaming programming photoshop content creation as whole just because theyre useless to you doesnt make them useless to others
Apple,iPhone 16,one laptop and one gaming phone
Apple,iPhone 16,should wait for the iphone rumors says it has hz inch upgradable mp selfie cam more wait for the next year there we be iphone plus pro and pro max in the next year
Apple,iPhone 16,get nice laptop instead why laptops are pretty useless except for schoolwork and maybe occasional gaming
Apple,iPhone 16,my opinion is the iphone its very overpriced eur for what just to have ios closed system operating no always on display the battery its very little capacity minimum required mahmah charging its from flintstones epoch wired in and hz display its unacceptable no ltpo oled display from this exorbitant price for what you pay eur just for brand no thanks this phone its not hi midrange phone its considered hi class premium phone very interesting
Apple,iPhone 16,its not an intelligent phone just an overpriced phone with too many buttons while holding this phone you cant avoid touching button also rs phone doesnt have an aod featuretotally waste base modal feature gb only very frustrating for photogenic engine users go for this only if you are photographer or video creator quality impressive
Apple,iPhone 16,talks about the camera button being gimmick in the same sentence demands usb on phone so you want to pay more money but the input device recharge and send output is worse each year compared to low price with type or lol your statement is so funny
Apple,iPhone 16,just dont switch phones in the first place you arent getting anything new and th more same person honestly its just that my phone has its back peeled off by itself again for times alrdy dislike samsung phones with this issue anyways thanks ill wait and see
Apple,iPhone 16,now using samsung as is this phone worthy upgrade in terms of battery now averaging more just dont switch phones in the first place you arent getting anything new and the added performance doesnt mean much
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone pro titanium frame thinner bezels hz ltpo display always on display more battery on the is ass
Apple,iPhone 16,beyond the fact that you have phone that costs with hz screen and youre str more youre seriously overthinking it learn to respect other peoples choices bro
Apple,iPhone 16,this or pro iphone pro titanium frame thinner bezels hz ltpo display always on display telephoto camera better main camera usb iphone camera control button slightly lighter better thermals wifi better battery life year longer software support go ahead and decide for yourself personally id pick the pro
Apple,iPhone 16,ios you can pause video recording if press record on my iphone white pause button more wooo amazing now im looking forward to the iphone launch event im dying to see how theyll introduce the split screen feature in ios as if its the newest and most revolutionary thing in the phone industry
Apple,iPhone 16,finally we can conclude one thing this phone is for the ladies with zero common sense own cheap android with hz display but only use hz most of the time because it saves battery life and reduces heat no point of using hz when all do everyday is browsing the web watching yt and playing slowpaced puzzle games so the iphone being stuck at hz is not much of deal breaker for me
Apple,iPhone 16,hz nah brother its hz display finally we can conclude one thing this phone is for the ladies with zero common sense
Apple,iPhone 16,hertz in only stupid people will buy this phone
Apple,iPhone 16,please advise me on whether to choose the iphone or the iphone based on battery life and hardware specifications if there are issues
Apple,iPhone 16,gud phone used android and dont understand it coz it require customisation and can use more average iphone user
Apple,iPhone 16,get it its nice to have telephoto but think most people would rather have ultraw more true personally id prefer mm main and mm tele mm is wide enough and further options can be implemented into camera app semipanorama to get ultrawide just pan the phone little to the left then symmetrical to the right and bam uw picture with resolution and for macro just use zoom you would have complete set of cameras with just sensors id use the lytia for main sensor and lytia for telephoto and front pair that with gen wired charging and screen on top of mah battery and you have the absolute perfect phone if only such things were possible
Apple,iPhone 16,they already did that the base model had standard telephoto lens which was superb but more get it its nice to have telephoto but think most people would rather have ultrawide main combo instead of telephoto main combo besides lets think for second if that wasnt actually the case wouldnt that just mean less pro and pro max models selling for apple theyd profit less so they wouldnt do it either way and think the comparison of the ultra series was completely sensible because was not comparing an iphone to an android was comparing the result of what would happen if it were to be present on androids
Apple,iPhone 16,its not about the pricing this is flagship we are talking its much worse for more they already did that the base model had standard telephoto lens which was superb but in they replaced the telephoto with an ultrawide hence if you want telephoto sensor you should jump to the pro models which are quite expensive the comparison with the ultra series is nonsense since im talking about the base iphone the upcoming se would definitely be deal if it borrowed the iphone camera not the one found on which is completely outdated
Apple,iPhone 16,what exactly in changing the camera setup and making the iphone more affordable makes it worse its not about the pricing this is flagship we are talking its much worse for them to release it at cheaper price but take away features that were present on previous models rather than have it sit at the same price or make it dollars more expensive and have huge improvements instead imagine if your ultra has all the camera lenses in the world and suddenly the ultra has just the main with no way to compensate for the missing lenses its terrible idea in general especially given the fact that the se exists already and is basically what youre looking for
Apple,iPhone 16,ios is rubbish keep your mouth shut android fanboy know that with ios we can now arrange more love ios on my iphone not had any issues at all with the phone updated to ios on the th sept all good so far havent updated my iphone minis to ios just to theyre working fine also battery health on them one the other the mini with battery health is used more
Apple,iPhone 16,and there it is the real reason for why youre an iphone hater youre too poor to more ios you can pause video recording if press record on my iphone white pause button lights up next to the red start stop button
Apple,iPhone 16,why why would you want them to literally make their phones worse what exactly in changing the camera setup and making the iphone more affordable makes it worse
Apple,iPhone 16,connecting oct how many ios update will the iphone get six ios updates as far as know so this phone should receive updates until ios
Apple,iPhone 16,how many ios update will the iphone get
Apple,iPhone 16,its base apple model with hz screen dull people will buy this dull phone same more hz nah brother its hz display
Apple,iPhone 16,hey apple in the iphone replace the ultrawide camera with telephoto one and leave the more why why would you want them to literally make their phones worse
Apple,iPhone 16,roomate just brought it home it isnt leaps forward from his older iphone still there are very subtle differences like customization that could be the reason why someone would buy this but it isnt enough for me to leave android camera processing hand comfort is pretty much the same no fast charging and no hz is huge letdown
Apple,iPhone 16,oh you can change color and localization for applications ahahah as said use nokia more and there it is the real reason for why youre an iphone hater youre too poor to buy an iphone so you have nokia phone ew nokia what are we in you dont even have to pay for this iphone with hz screen usb no aod no telephoto lens apart from ai which we will have in few months therere rumors that apple is planning revolutionary features for ios such as pausing during video recording and displaying two apps at the same time in split screen your cheap lamedroid has no chance
Apple,iPhone 16,when will this gonna be available in shopee
Apple,iPhone 16,fun fact tried em all and except one none of these cant compete with samsung and its more ios is rubbish keep your mouth shut android fanboy know that with ios we can now arrange the app icons on the home screen as we please and even change their color can your android do that thats what thought behold httpsmyoutubecomwatchvzrrgnmuoo
Apple,iPhone 16,hi appleplease bring back mini model apple yeah sure in minute in second well do it
Apple,iPhone 16,heres reality check for you pal nobody cares how superior your is to more fun fact tried em all and except one none of these cant compete with samsung and its the best all around phone you can get snapdragon chips ofc and if samsung is uninnovative whats iphone then innovative unlike you used them all and ios is rubbish better use nokia it has more freedom
Apple,iPhone 16,love how after years of base iphones using last years processors we returned to nor more the way know apple the is rebrand of the with slightly different frequencies of the cores and newer instruction set and what is certain is that the chip is rebrand of the in terms of the gpu httpsnanoreviewnetensoccompareappleavsappleabionic
Apple,iPhone 16,first base galaxy has everything and even more than iphone has for half price thi more heres reality check for you pal nobody cares how superior your is to the iphone people should be allowed to like whatever phone and from whatever brand they want to like without getting put down and bullied by the likes of you how would you like it if xiaomi honor or oneplus user were to do the same thing to you by making fun of your for being am overpriced uninnovative piece of trash
Apple,iPhone 16,for the same price you can get ulta with tb without hideous notch hz wont comment for you can get sony xperia vi with similar specs headphone jack sd card support
Apple,iPhone 16,this or wait for xiaomi yes
Apple,iPhone 16,ip or ippro which one should buy pixel switch good meal
Apple,iPhone 16,maybe the first base iphone that has almost everything only con is the hz screen first base galaxy has everything and even more than iphone has for half price think with your brain another brainwashed fanboy
Apple,iPhone 16,hz is ridiculous for euro phone and in europe no ai maybe in there are no rea more agreed
Apple,iPhone 16,for hz refresh rate flagship this has got to be joke
Apple,iPhone 16,dig the cam design of more than this one the new design looks comical
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone and lame budget phone design if see any apple fanboys defending this genuinely give up on humanity
Apple,iPhone 16,after the new iphone now iphone only gimmick lol her base model remember only usb more talks about the camera button being gimmick in the same sentence demands usb on phone
Apple,iPhone 16,shouldve included hz or hz even hz in flagship is awful
Apple,iPhone 16,hz what kind of joke is this and no ai and always on display
Apple,iPhone 16,sam iphone old design
Apple,iPhone 16,and no ai and always on display wait thought it has an ai
Apple,iPhone 16,no hz even still nice ultramarine design colors but still trash phone true they should put atleast hz and always on display
Apple,iPhone 16,honestly they should just add side fingerprint scanner on their phone instead some extra ded more dont think fingerprint scanner would bring in more sales at all but if they could find way to make the camera control button double as fingerprint scanner in future models that would be great
Apple,iPhone 16,what nonsesne camera is anyday better than andorid flagships this argument is incredibly stupid now obviously the camera on the iphone is better than year old oneplus nord but the base iphone is not match for flagship android phones like the ultra
Apple,iPhone 16,the camera and specs are somehow weaker than year old oneplus nord dont see this be more what nonsesne camera is anyday better than andorid flagships
Apple,iPhone 16,hz this is truly joke apple has to make their costumers somehow to buy the pro models the more expensive models
Apple,iPhone 16,wait for th september broifixit will reveal for you wh compared to wh on iphone bigger can be seen in regulatory information httpschemtrecblobcorewindowsnetcriterionapisbpiscurrentpdf
Apple,iPhone 16,dont mind with hz display idc about always on display as long as can have great battery timing performance and great camera imma buy this iphone cuz phone is always in ur pocket and no need to show off to people dont game on phone only using few social apps photography when needed and calling maybe like usage is hours day think it will be worth to upgrade to iphone after the iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 16,adamg sep there is no information about battery in iphone series in hz display for phon more wait for th september broifixit will reveal for you
Apple,iPhone 16,but the human eye cant tell the difference past hz try using an hz display promise you cant go back to hz once you try it
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone gb is ok for most smart phone users in
Apple,iPhone 16,so when will the basic models of the iphone have the same features that can be found now on models of competing companies in the same price ranges say iphone or
Apple,iPhone 16,did they put extra fingerprint sensor on the side after series tha more its dedicated camera button check the release video
Apple,iPhone 16,wait for se might be now that be funneeee
Apple,iPhone 16,will definitely buy this and give it to those who cant afford it sure ya will lol
Apple,iPhone 16,teal ultramarine colors are straight up inspired by the oneplus pro
Apple,iPhone 16,it means it has hz screen its smart hz so they know how to force people dream of or buy the higher end models dont like apple at all but on marketing they know how to make you pay really if they wanted to make it hz of course they could have could even be almost already there in hardware cant know because its so walked garden cannot see anything whats inside
Apple,iPhone 16,its basically huawei nova se ripoff
Apple,iPhone 16,tims not cooking anymore just reheating
Apple,iPhone 16,they dont need them gamers can use other devices photographers can use rea more was just chuckling about that persons use of the word need in his post moment ago wonder what he thinks people needed before wireless tech existed
Apple,iPhone 16,think people buy this because its easy to navigate and use and the face id camera and how it saves passwords and doesnt mysteriously delete them like android phones and glitches or doesnt even offer to use saved password on androidand yes human can tell phone is at hz just scroll fast and itll lag thats hz for you
Apple,iPhone 16,you write nonsense gamers need flagship phones photography enthusiasts need flagship phones more they dont need them gamers can use other devices photographers can use real cameras instead theres such small percentage of people who are actually power users again correct me if im wrong but wouldnt it legit just be better to have higher refresh rate at this price point given that the competition has it
Apple,iPhone 16,still apples walled garden can be the best ahead would be still walled worse read today googoo step back for apk and enforce gplay through api same as apple in the end bad time for freedom for it for poorer people but very veryw very lucrative time for the rich enforcing those at same time nobody matters no so pay and pay again
Apple,iPhone 16,same phone every year lol
Apple,iPhone 16,same same but different but still same so dont buy it
Apple,iPhone 16,they havent fix the modem yet apple is just milking people who are not tech savvy most of apples customer are not tech savvy these are people who just need phone that can call and clear voice calls other than that of the features are just bonus or not even used by these apple customers what mean apple customers these are people that dont know tech not an influencer not tiktoker if this even word not person who relies on affiliate marketing and post their content on youtube to get monetize not content creator these are just only of apple customers the of apple customers are not tech savvy they either have money to spare money from savings credit installments and take advantage of the tradein programs so there you have it folks milking of apple customers
Apple,iPhone 16,you dont need flagship phone in general guarantee you nobody buys an more you write nonsense gamers need flagship phones photography enthusiasts need flagship phones power users need flagship phones normies dont need flagship phones even though they buy them as status symbol
Apple,iPhone 16,hz screan hz is straight up an insult
Apple,iPhone 16,its pretty and cause can not all functions warrant the concern haters want to post more you dont need flagship phone in general guarantee you nobody buys an ultra because they need it not even the year update policy is much of reason to call it need to buy phone you dont need the or or or even hz refresh rate either youre correct but youve got to keep in mind that this is dollar phone given that the competition uses hz and trust me truuust me when say this hz is so nice to use compared to hz theres no point in not having it and there would be more people who would buy vanilla or plus iphone over some androids if it just had hz display perhaps the biggest issue is that the display hasnt changed at all this year on any of the iphone models
Apple,iPhone 16,euros for an iphone that only offers gb does not include charger and also has weak more hz screan
Apple,iPhone 16,all iphone lineup has charging rate its been confirmed yesterday although not advertised by apple
Apple,iPhone 16,this the biggest innovation for iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,the wallpaper looks like guns double barrel pointed towards you why am not surprised
Apple,iPhone 16,leaving pros and pro maxs samsung can win against vanilla models yet they dig their own holes is hit phone bcoz of snapdragon but coming next to why exynos most of countries if it used in other markets than us then it can get more sales from india many interested in only exynos chip is the reason they choosing iphone over samsung should stop making exynos chips coz even mtk dimensity is much much better than theirs and start focussing on better marketing than they can easily win over iphones but never changing things from universe are iphone hz and samsung exynos
Apple,iPhone 16,anyone who buys apple phones is either fanboy or normie who sees iphones as status symbol agreed
Apple,iPhone 16,usb was years ago btw
Apple,iPhone 16,call me when can buy it new under thx
Apple,iPhone 16,no one disables it coz they would use adaptive refresh which downs to hz to save battery at more the main problem is nobody is complaining apple will never change and dont have problem with that people should buy whatever they likeits not like the majority would know the meaning of hz anyway
Apple,iPhone 16,why it is not mentioned about hz screen in specs
Apple,iPhone 16,it is apple no usb no hz charging premium price at this price android flagship sold
Apple,iPhone 16,hz in wtf
Apple,iPhone 16,awful phone
Apple,iPhone 16,the funny thing is they used qlc storage for gb lol source
Apple,iPhone 16,theres no filesystem for the user on ios its all itunes or cloud all under apple more there is of course file system its called files and its divided in into icloud drive only if you want to use that and on my iphone so another case of person who never used an iphone complaining about things that are not even true but that they would know of if they ever used it
Apple,iPhone 16,how many watts is the iphone charging
Apple,iPhone 16,think would love to have the phone if just could understand the file system of ios ok more theres no filesystem for the user on ios its all itunes or cloud all under apples control its not your files its their pay more and then more again thats why its walled garden as love their hardware and proci cant stand their software second
Apple,iPhone 16,buying hz phone in will feel the same as buying the lcd back in youl more true
Apple,iPhone 16,drvee sep iphones switching to look like an android phone and android phones switching to look like an more never like apple wallen garden either tried many times iphone but but but android espacialy zamzung become same close with tons of non removable nonconfigurable nonrootablr darkpatrerns and shaddy spy and non disabling packages and forced things bigsby now ai force to insert sim to boot up probably soon to have zamazung account too just try abd to see how many spybloatbattery useless stuff running in background with googoo related to those of course so never say never maybe one day will be forced to switch their hardware has always been superior to me so if their software is same everywhere and not anymore more expensive then yes ill switch
Apple,iPhone 16,apple is kidding people again and againno major changeseven hz they didnt put in are they jokingdoesnt worth it
Apple,iPhone 16,us market usd european market eur what difference us price is without sales tax vat eu price is with vat included
Apple,iPhone 16,why didnt the iphone pro and pro max use the same design characteristics bruh paying more for familiar design display seems to remain unchanged too
Apple,iPhone 16,minute video is around or mb and there is still gb variant hmmm interesting
Apple,iPhone 16,iphones switching to look like an android phone and android phones switching to look like an iphone never ending love story lol but never liked apple ecosystem and probably never will it used to be some sort of status symbol for most people dont think it is anymore every other person in india owns an iphone even the person who earns about in indian currency month fun fact they dont even need an iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,ok but why the model look like android what android are you comparing as if its an stereotype on wait why is the led flash is out now lol you might be right
Apple,iPhone 16,camera looks better but no hz why also no alwayson display hahaha
Apple,iPhone 16,euro for this seriously theyll probably charge for the lower storage models lbs is probably for the gb model
Apple,iPhone 16,dollars phone has hz type not mention first charging is criminal but apple fan gay will still buy it thats how blind they are thats mean they have money but no knowledge
Apple,iPhone 16,only less would be using hz phone with that price and in
Apple,iPhone 16,nothing really new than my iphone besides the marketing ai dan others they said generation gap chipset but compares with only faster up to cpu and gpu even the battery only last more hours in reality the value will be lower than their marketing value ai dont know why it is not more than just marketing gimmick than really valuable things apple had sold until under the name bionic with npu it is not enough the gallery apps on iphone can automatically separate face and background mostly accurate and can direct copy it to whatsapp as stickers really no need to upgrade now maybe wait for the generations ahead there are really something new
Apple,iPhone 16,because iphone has inch and iphone has inch but gsmarena just rounds it to more correct
Apple,iPhone 16,dont forget its still hz of course hz screens in fckin entering
Apple,iPhone 16,hahaahahah and youve months left never to see want to hear joke the iphone and iphone plus will be stuck at hz in
Apple,iPhone 16,im waiting for iphone lol okay see you
Apple,iPhone 16,you guys dont get it they keep the screen at hz to compensate for their tiny battery thats why others have the option to make it hz if needed
Apple,iPhone 16,this time they were successful in making it look worse than before so obviously not their best looking iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,honestly id have thought theyd have added high refresh rate on phone costing pounds even if it is the entry model
Apple,iPhone 16,bit panel
Apple,iPhone 16,nobody slept outside these days waiting in line like old days
Apple,iPhone 16,in was lying in hospital bed and angrily asked my grandson kid why is the ip more hahaahahah and youve months left never to see
Apple,iPhone 16,how usb speeds but with support for displayport how
Apple,iPhone 16,apart from the upgraded ram to gb and name from iphone to iphone is there any notable differences in designing and screen technology appearances
Apple,iPhone 16,its late and apple still puts on an iphone nothing important changed hz notch in apple still not able to make decent front camera cut unbelievable same display same bulkyness these phones are called bricksphones with of the price are slim below mm thickness it has builtin slowness called animation mode to not see that its moving slow had androids for years iphone for years in parallel androids is smoother faster way more easy to use the settings on iphone are jsut to be as they dont work the phones are laggy an samsung or motorola edge or xiaomi are light years above an iphonestorage display yeah know its tunes to look like an enhanced bimbo but its ugly and unreal storage charging not to mention the battery which can do max half day are all behing android realm with at least yearsand ai apple cant make ai with limited hardware it needs from gb ram for ai to work seamlesslyso no never it feels like scam or if you just want to have apple logo otherwise on every aspect iphone looses to android
Apple,iPhone 16,is the bionic chip same as the pro no
Apple,iPhone 16,would still buy it despite having hz screen
Apple,iPhone 16,wow iphone launched lets check it out wait minute is it relaunch with modified design of the iphone and iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,what disgrace apple no telephoto no hz not even hz same design iphone died after ipro for its considered mid range phone so buying midrange phone at that price its mad youre mad if youre considering buying this phone id rather wait for the oneplus for periscope camera high refresh rate and more
Apple,iPhone 16,hz on the standard iphone believe is one way to motivate your customers to buy pro max version for more money it would be wise for people to vote with their wallets for this circumstance to change
Apple,iPhone 16,among all shortages the hz is the most absurd dont understand how people will tolerate this and still buy this device
Apple,iPhone 16,hz in biggest joke of company
Apple,iPhone 16,usb hz display no telephoto camera poor ultra wide angle camera ancient liion battery poorly disposable battery as glued down and of subsidized price what joke the red price for this is xiaomi redmi turbo cost honor gt cost realme pro cost vivo iqoo neos pro cost yet has much more and so on so on
Apple,iPhone 16,hz im waiting for iphone lol
Apple,iPhone 16,nice uh hz refresh rate keep waiting for the hz also it seems we have returned to more good those eyes where funny
Apple,iPhone 16,think so but wanna buy it cuz its color is cute what colour like
Apple,iPhone 16,time sure flies cant believe my iphone is already obsolete not really if it works for everyday tasks it surely isnt obsolete
Apple,iPhone 16,remember people defending usb of iphone saying chip wasnt designed to use usb and higher data rate cause it doesnt have usb controller now am excited to see what excuses they come up with for this phone
Apple,iPhone 16,standard model ta are usually used to hz so guess its fine
Apple,iPhone 16,disapointed with hz
Apple,iPhone 16,usb released in year charging speed released in year first used by iphone hz display released in year first used by iphone unbelievable in year apple still dare to put these specs into their standard iphones and charging us at higher price than last year ok if apple wanna play games with me im fine with that ill wait until the day iphone finally upgraded above these limits
Apple,iPhone 16,unbelievable apple still has the courage to use usb released in year for the standard iphone
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone remains thinner and light weight
Apple,iPhone 16,iphone redmi edition no sorry redmi offers hz screen looks like apple released these phones to only push people to purchase pro series these phones shouldnt really exist on the market
Apple,iPhone 16,for photographers same camera as dont waste your money on the each year apple apparently runs out of ideastheyre truly milking the cow
Apple,iPhone 16,dude no promotion
Apple,iPhone 16,finally white one ffs even better at its one of the lightest phones released in together with galaxy motorola honor lite xperia vi nova aquos sense httpswwwgsmarenacomresultsphpnyearminnweightmax and the specs say it has thread so from my understanding one does not need thread hub to control smart home accessories using that standard together with macro on ne probably gb ram only thing missing is hz with aod
Apple,iPhone 16,so unless youre on iphone or lower skip it all those processor gimmicks arent for your everyday phone tasks majority dont even hit of what these new chips are capable of but end up paying for it
Apple,iPhone 16,and the crowd goes wild lolz because it iphone nothing special or new about the spec everything is just fake and lies
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,apples pricing strategy is indeed testament to their mastery in balancing innovation and more mastering profitability mostly but they make good crrap yes id say it more like that software is insanely buggy and walled garden and cockypretentious but android copying same shyt locking down like activation forcing cloudnonsense android expensive if not even more than ifone krap so no choice than switch to ioshyte next fone might be dumpfone start to get too old to bear all those nonsense and bugs
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,does iphone plus also has heating problemissue anyone exp even normal use excluding gaming heavy apps
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,apple has surely taken all that into consideration when they set their profit margins which more apples pricing strategy is indeed testament to their mastery in balancing innovation and profitability by carefully selecting which features to introduce across their lineup they ensure that every model appeals to specific audience while maintaining substantial profit margins even with the additional cost of premium features like the hz refresh rate apples unparalleled brand loyalty and ecosystem integration allow them to remain the most profitable smartphone manufacturer year after year its impressive how they manage to stay ahead in the market without compromising their high standards or profitability wouldnt you agree that this is key reason for their dominance
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,the iphone plus indeed occupies an interesting spot in the lineup its true that it offers larger screen and the best battery life among the iphones which makes it an appealing choice for users who prioritize media consumption gaming or extended usage without frequent recharging however its price point being close to the pro model might make some users question its value especially since it lacks the more advanced camera systems and proexclusive features like the higher refresh rate display or stainless steel build for someone who isnt heavily into photography or the premium feel of the pro models but values larger screen and excellent battery life the iphone plus could be the ideal choice its balanced option especially compared to the significantly pricier pro max while still offering key flagship features would you consider it for those priorities or are you more inclined toward the pro features
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,apple roll back its housing design to iphone its look like bigger version of iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,did went from iphone pro to iphone plus got used to it like in hours guess there are execptions although rare after all there are some people that genuinely say they dont notice the difference between and hertz which can not believe at all
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,what amuses me the most is that apple have to make money somewhere for all the marketing and more wow the clown school you have gotten your degree from is top notch the jokes you make are hilarious apple creates and holds ios in steel grip so who are they going to pay the licensing fees to themselves they refuse to open it up to anyone else since thats the gameplay to maximize the profit from double dipping into all app sales subscriptions and additional developer fees to even access their api also fyi ios is segmented on purpose to prevent macos apps from running natively on it due to you guessed it double dipping once again and now we also have ipados so segmentation like tapeworm is the name of the game educate yourself on how apple has monopoly over ios and apple devices before white knighting them with some really funny bs
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,good colorways pink is my favorite
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,iphone plus still getting secuirty patches almost years lol sure and software updates for years you lose security updates you gain security updates
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,youre right and the fe delivers far more than that iphone plus still getting secuirty patches almost years lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,iphone plus actully better phone when it comes to cooloing and gaming prefromanc than iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,lmao and you believe them after their record on this matter yes because it has been good
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,samsung have major os updates more than iphone ever have imagine thinking it is yeah unfortunately all we have to go off is samsungs atrocious record wouldnt hold my breath if was you son
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,wow the battery life on the plus is impressive mainly use android but the incredibly high battery life endurance numbers makes me want this phone just for the day battery life id get with my low usage
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,some people want more than one major os update samsung have major os updates more than iphone ever have imagine thinking it is
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,list me at hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,just get samsung fe even that would be better vfm sure no ltpo but at least it has more some people want more than one major os update
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,mrwhoistheboss is the only one on the entire internet saying su has better battery life you more interesting to see that mentioned promax being better than plus in his test contrary to gsmarena and others but peeps like seem to notice only the ultra in my comment
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,god knows im not one to defend apple in any way especially when it comes to more hz refresh rate is not intrinsically bad thing but apple is asking flagship price for it so naturally they get flak for that even this review site has it listed as con and buying something else does not change the fact that this one is below industry standard in that particular aspect which does warrant some criticism
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,mr whose the boss had different battery result pro max had better longevity infact ultra more mrwhoistheboss is the only one on the entire internet saying su has better battery life you wont find anyone anywhere saying else why wont you check that first
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,im sorry somebody forcing you to buy the newest iphone are they or are you free to make more have base its been years and from perspective of any other brand user after this long time the difference between their phone and the new one tells them that its time for upgrade but why should the better soc means nothing if there is nothing challenging for old one mean except for games like genshin is there game that does not run smoothly on hz its only apple intelligence and its not available in eu better battery life little better camera oled display for better or worse does these two justify years of rd its not like people buy phones just for the sake of buying new one
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,on jeez well if its robbery report it then give that try assume they have law more god knows im not one to defend apple in any way especially when it comes to iphones but gotta agree that people are making somewhat too big of deal from the hz base iphone models situation ive lived for long time with hz on my phone and when made the switch to more modern hzsupporting smartphone really couldnt tell that much of difference yeah maybe if you look close enough but and most consumers can hardly see the difference in daytoday use and dont think that its something that should stop people from buying the base iphones still find it weird indeed that apple hasnt yet added hrr to the base iphones and while its definitely convenient to have hz instead of hz dont believe having hz should be deal breaker in any way especially for the average joe who doesnt care about the refresh rate of the screen but rather on the apple logo on the back for those actually caring about hrr go look somewhere else in the thousands of options out there simple in anyway im sure apple will eventually add hz to the base iphones anytime from now
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,this doesnt show that people dont care it shows that people buy yesterdays crap more did went from iphone pro to iphone plus got used to it like in hours
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,its highway robbery plain and simple phones with less than half its price has it so more on jeez well if its robbery report it then give that try assume they have law enforcement in your neck of the woods right go inform them that people are choosing to buy iphones see what happens be critical all you want dont buy iphones as long as you want it matters nothing to me again my point was hrr is not that big of deal for everyone and that obviously many people will choose to buy the base iphones based on host of other reasons why is that so controversial on this dam site
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,what stupid comment whos breaking any laws here ffs and im not defending or gat more its highway robbery plain and simple phones with less than half its price has it so of course that glaring ommission would be called out the most but for some reason that bothers you so much that you even talk as if certain group has no right to criticize that
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,you try so hard to gatekeep the criticism on the brand that you practically worship smh more what stupid comment whos breaking any laws here ffs and im not defending or gatekeeping anything if apple end up loosing sales due to lack of something like hrr display panels oh well thats their problem doesnt seem to be happening though as far as can tell all am doing is pointing out what seems blatantly obvious to me but seems to baffle the rest of you and that is hrr display are not the be all and end all for everyone on this dam planet
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,man arent you starting to feel bit embarrassed you defend this year after year and more why would be embarrassed dont build the things and you dont speak for others dude people have their own reasons for either buying or not buying iphones and highly doubt it all comes down to how fast the display refreshes all models are still selling regardless though thats just fact if it bothers you and it seems like it does for some reason please know that dont give flying you know what
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,people on sites like this seem to obsess over this hhr display thing on base iphones and it more man arent you starting to feel bit embarrassed you defend this year after year and with every year the hertz display in iphones is getting more sad people dont miss things they never experienced thats why these phones sell its like someone driving lada with the difference that ladas are very cheap cars while an iphone is absurdly expensive for the specs given once those people drive western car they will mever go back same with people going from crappy nonpro iphone to the pro models
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,man didnt even look at the battery scores smh eh beaides the battery life he is right even then the comparison to the pro models show that their antique display isnt even that impactful for the battery its just really bad value
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,awful value at it should be max and even that is lot for this
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,bad phone with bad price small amount of ram with just an average battery stay away from ip more man didnt even look at the battery scores smh
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,simple even more profit for them duhhhhh wouldnt be much profit to be had if these things werent selling now would there almost like this whole hrr thing isnt that big of deal
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,for this gb hz screen no fast charging no telephoto etc youre being robb more not bad call except for worse battery life and vs years of updates and no camera button
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,how do they justify hz panel in does anyone know it seems super strange given the more justify it or not it will sell like hotcakes anyway
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,the battery score is weird compared to others its like the admin wants to benefit apple yeah hv seen vivo pro among other android vs ip pm battery and the pro beats the ip pm according to gsma battery test pro scored hrs vs ip pm hrslike woahh
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,welcome to after spending in my country
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,then dont set your phone at hz and enjoy life however its fascinating more have the pro max and with hz set get hrs charge with moderate use honestly though would have went plus if it had hz panel got used to that on my pixel pro and cant go back
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,expensive and nothing new typical apple trash
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,and it appears to mostly be those who wouldnt buy the dam things even if they had more im sure it is in your head dude
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,the video shows phone set hz ran out of battery while still when set hz since ma more httpsiimgflipcomnjbjpg
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,lol no the real reasons apple is years ahead of the competition thats about it more no su cant be perfectly optimised as ios and is reason but no its not the main reason
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,severals android highend models trashed iphone series with the typical battery capacity more sorry couldnt make out your point if you had any through all that swearing and bad manners
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,screen refresh rate is times less than pro ultra pixel etc iphones scree more lol no the real reasons apple is years ahead of the competition thats about it series is well optimized too and loses with bigger battery
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,in the video you provided the hz one still has battery life not the difference between hrs and hrs is mr giga brain
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,nothing
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,the difference is httpsyoutubecynfhpnsbdk also the first comment on that video su more the video shows phone set hz ran out of battery while still when set hz since majority of phones today have mah that represents mah difference in months person would need more recharges compared to phone set hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,no problem they will increase their batteries to mah weight will surpass and they more severals android highend models trashed iphone series with the typical battery capacity dont cry little fanboy
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,this is almost to xperia in camera quality even not worse except the hdr in some cases plus the battery is better on xperia vi screen and speakers depends on the user but this one is overpriced like hell much worse than sonys my my my
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,subjectively hz on iphone barely noticeable same time very much noticeable on hz android midranger vs hz mode
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,so you say ios is very optimised to work on apple products well done sherlock you worked tha more yeah it is well optimised use my pixel pro and actually am not thinking to upgrade on iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,envy the iphone camera samsung processing is terrible from series envy really trust me had and returned the pro max it had awful processingterribly over sharpened noisy at zoomshadows way too darkmuted colours bordering on too palelens flare and lens ghosting is worse than any manufacturer trust me it aint the pinnacle of image quality
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,actually think the foliage looks terrible over sharpened and processed
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,how they make magic battery life screen refresh rate is times less than pro ultra pixel etc iphones screen dim at around ios is made for iphones only iphones its is very optimised to work on apple products
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,not with higher density batteries but of course you wont keep up with what will happen more dont be suprised for arrival of laptop level capacitty in phones with solid state batteries
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,iphone battery life is extremely good across all their phones this year wakeup call for an more how they make magic battery life
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,set your phone at hz and your battery life will tell you different story the difference is httpsyoutubecynfhpnsbdk also the first comment on that video summarizes it pretty well cite imagine what its like to buy hz phone to use at hz and criticize whoever buys hz phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,new iphones stopped being exciting years ago most phones became unexciting years ago unless perhaps foldablesmaybe
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,for those wondering to upgrade heres my upgrade chart iphone keep this is because your phone is still too new to deem upgradeworthy iphone wait until aging rapidly but hold onto it for series trust itll be worth the wait iphone xs and would upgrade already aged years so good idea to upgrade already iphone xr and earlier without doubt gb of ram is low in and the chip is aged finely as for android phones its hard to tell when to upgrade will say this if your phone starts to feel obsolete and performs sluggish it could be time to replace the battery or look for new phone entirely
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,would have been pretty nice if this had hz display dollars cheaper and then starting at gb
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,so the nonpro iphones without ltpo lasting more than pro counterparts despite less battery screen size is meaningless not enough to make impact
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,its surprising that the megapixel mode seems to have better demosaicing than the mode
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,ios doesnt need nearly as much ram as android to run wwll gb ios ram is still comparable to more its not because android is heavier its because ios literally doesnt have real multitasking
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,and they do gb and gb models ha ha ha even the top one with gb is still only gb more ios doesnt need nearly as much ram as android to run wwll gb ios ram is still comparable to gb android ram android is heavier os
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,iphone can never learn to designno difference between and plus just like chinese smartphones have the same circular back and design
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,im about to get from my work place smartphone and got options iphone plus or more plus
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,the last tie checked gsmarena is not exclusive to android phones so please kindl more if you accept the limitations and like being ordered around then you will love iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,doubt if you really use iphone and android together to the fullest and called it best of bot more the last tie checked gsmarena is not exclusive to android phones so please kindly respect others opinions what mean by best of both worlds because have owned android devices in the past years ive had limited experience with ios tho ive had them in the past and now my current one which is an iphone pro we use our phones in many different ways and all of us have our own work and personal profile on what apps we used what we do with our phones etc really dont need to mention these things because it is very obvious and non issue opinions are opinions yes but would appreciate if we stick to the issue and give respect like having discussions and healthy conversations with likeminded people here this is why am here yup android is more open and yup ios is more closed but do people realize android is becoming private and in many ways becoming ios and vice versa does anybody know about the eus plan to force apple to open up its notifications to thirdparties
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,lets face itandroid is becoming and slowly copying ios and ios is becoming and slowly more doubt if you really use iphone and android together to the fullest and called it best of both world till this day there are so many limitation on the ios than android without the ios ecosystem ios is just junk which makes life worse sure many already get used to the ios limitation wont feel the pain as they prefer workaround than having real solution for me really just get life with any android and stay away from the closed ios never fond for any crap iphone review by any biased reviewer
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,stock android is not up to speed with the industry what does that even mean sto more lets face itandroid is becoming and slowly copying ios and ios is becoming and slowly copying android but in the end the race will be won by someone who can offer highly optimized and flexible os performance in terms of ai and device capability and price both have an upper midrange iphone and lowmidrange android moto so feel have the best of both worlds for now the iphone serves my needs yes it could be better in some ways but having closed os means the phone functions and acts the way it should and the way want it androids issue still remains fragmentation
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,this afternoon went to an apple store pretty much most of my questions apart from around more you must let apple or previous user or yourself unlink it from icloud
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,no display omg lol on plus
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,dude have you ever touch hz screen from cheap android phone it feels waaaaaay smother more had samsung galaxy plus with hrz and really dont feel any serious difference
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,apple sucks dont ever get locked out days waiting bs android easier also bad specs lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,hz screen lmfao apple is pathetic at this point posting this comment from my pro btw hrz or makes such big difference you really feel it
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,ive seen this phone before personally and btw some android companies are copying apple cameras
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,and plus arent lcd theyre oled the iphone is oled as well
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,am really sad that there is no iphone minis the plus lineup is kind of useless given the fact that can just get pro max but well rip
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,yeah and get greenscreen series defective iphone the pro max is the least problematic iphone the first pro iphone to have good battery endurance first to introduce fast refresh rate and more even the pro max was reported to have multitude of issues the pro max with heat dissipation and or throttling issues say this while using an android
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,thick heavy brick there is no new innovation left in apple phones stop wasting money on new more yeah and get greenscreen series defective iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,the only social media platform use is gsmarena
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,full charge battery for iphone plus lasts days with moderate use lol hrs probably slow down updates
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,lmfao literally first place in httpswwwgsmarenacombatterytestvphp with mah ba more get no crying probably beat this
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,apple can now upgrade os inbox wirelessly and force on us old products upgraded security risk and degrade in performance with each new upgrade
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,general pile of crap compared to competitors such as pixel and
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,currently im using oneplus battery is draining fast till date havnt use ios now my in more dunno try it yourself and decide nobody know what exactly you are looking for
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,hahahahaha no yes it is
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,where did you read this could you please share the url hi sorry for late reply you can check it on macrumors toms guide pocketlint and news bytes
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,you may downgrade it with engineering roms or you could find good roms on xda forums and you more and plus arent lcd theyre oled
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,what you laugh hz its just an useless gimmick until all of the iphones have it then it will be the best thing since sliced bread
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,you obviously have never used hz display scrolling is way smoother than hz display more ive just moved from iphone pro max and prior to that had galaxy both those phones had refresh maybe my eyes arent upto much but genuinely dont see that much difference dont get me wrong there is difference and yes it would be better if the standard and plus iphones had rather than refresh get why reviewers have to highlight the refresh issue but folk banging on about it being dealbreaker are over the top as the plus model is so close to the pro in many ways to me it just wasnt worth the extra to get the better cameras better microphones and refresh and suspect for many consumers that will be the case
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,hz is lot of fun but personally find it too addictive and battery consuming im more lol it only consume like difference
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,what you laugh hz its just an useless gimmick
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,im really happy with this phone personally dont care about hz have had hz android pho more exactly this someone with working brain at last use hz too dont care for this hz gimmick then they complain for low battery life
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,you might need an eye laser surgery hz on android is way smoother than any hz display of more again with this hz is better gimmick crap its just waste of battery life
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,try it at my local mobile selling store cellphones its super smooth and hz on th more you might need an eye laser surgery hz on android is way smoother than any hz display of iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,samsung is not radiating when not in use iphone is so samsung is better iphones like most smartphones emit small amounts of electromagnetic radiation when they are on even if not in active use this is because they constantly maintain connections to cell towers wifi networks and bluetooth devices however the radiation levels are very low and are regulated by international safety standards set by organizations like the fcc and icnirp which are designed to prevent harmful exposure its important to note that theres no conclusive scientific evidence that the low levels of radiation emitted by phones are harmful to humans
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,need thin iphone not heavy the iphone is very thin
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,putting the very outdated display refresh rate this phone is actualy awesome if you want an iphone hz oled display with hz pwm dimming at all brightness levels is shame on the brand that gets in the way at the top honor hz display nits peak pwm dimming miles ahead by all appearances apple will likely go the way of ibm and microsoft and become just another boring slow moving litigation happy corporate entity utility
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,hz is shame try it at my local mobile selling store cellphones its super smooth and hz on the pro lineups are even better hz on iphones hz on android
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,because the phone from years ago is better than most new phones at the same price people on more just because phone is usable doesnt mean you should buy it and this isnt about how good the pro and pro max are agree they are nice phones and are still top notch but this is mostly about apple not wanting to innovate instead of giving their new phones an actually improved display theyve instead focused on apple intelligence which doesnt really have clear future it might be hit it might be miss again just think about it for second no vanilla iphone has had display with more than hz of refresh rate for the past generations
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,not good piece of advice im sorry but why should buy phone from generations ago more because the phone from years ago is better than most new phones at the same price people on this site always act like phones from few years ago even flagships are borderline unusable if you dont care about refresh rate and just want big screen theres other used iphones that are better for the price if you do care the iphone pro and pro max hold up very well today if you just want cheap hz phone and dont care about ios longevity or any exclusive iphone features then this clearly isnt the phone for you and theres no use in pretending that higher refresh rate display will change that
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,can everyone stop making the same unoriginal comment about the hz display if you want an ip more not good piece of advice im sorry but why should buy phone from generations ago from the same maker just because their newest one doesnt have the refresh rate want its unacceptable for such an expensive phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,cent really
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,reddish one looks like christmas tree decoration
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,really outdated look not to mention this pink many bezels at top of the range android price in late still these usual questionable policies
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,this phone doesnt have hz because apple reserves the best for the product they want yo more you mean their top option the most profit and youre absolutely right
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,dont mind the hz battery life is all care about
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,even my dads old crt monitor has an hz refresh rate lmao
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,it seems all ip series support wired charging
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,or phones from other companies in the price range around my mistake even cheaper httpsmgsmarenacomsamsunggalaxyapricephp httpsmgsmarenacomxiaomiredminotepropricephp httpsmgsmarenacommotorolamotogstylusgpricephp
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,liked camera design and ultramarine color almost decide to buy it but hz more true bur can handle hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,go to the pro models for ht those are more expensive and dont have the new design know ive brought this up like times but seriously why did they do that also it just doesnt make sense to sell phone with hz refessh rate with dollar price tag in doesnt matter if its faster than hz on an android its still hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,sooo itll cost euros and you dont even get telephoto apple is joke
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,techbyalexit sep hz that is absolutely unbelievable it must be joke in they still put hz display its definitely to make you buy the pros models
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,they on purpose give hz only to more expensive models cause nobody isnt crazy to loose their eyes to eur device with hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,phone in late with hz display but heard they will have hz next year
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,refresh rate not mentioned how much
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,nice ill buy iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,still hertz in below dollar phone giving unbelievable apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,where is tb gb oh no hz sreen no videos recording really
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,its the same iphone series they just changed the cpu it wont came with charger
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,no refesh rate just about to write this is the phone need
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,like but dont like series same specification same design very bad
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,apple got to be kidding with gb am seeing here
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,like iphone butthis is joke hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Plus,still hz lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,appreciate gsmarenas detailed review of the apple iphone pro its comprehensive analysis that covers various aspects of the device however noticed that the review doesnt mention the camera control button introduced in the iphone pro this new feature allows users to open the camera app switch between different camera controls and take photos or videos with specific gestures its thoughtful addition that enhances the user experience could you provide more information on how the camera control button functions in realworld usage specifically how does it compare to traditional camera controls in terms of speed and convenience
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the micro adjustments to each new phone combined with their planned obsolescence makes me thin more the iphones are literally the longest lasting phones cause of their bonkers single core performance and software support so what are you on about
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,hope you also add how fast the camera drains the battery same per min use is unacceptable
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,just bought mine today goodbye android and google ill never put my money again on chea more fakesome android more expensive than iphoneand experience more better than iosuse bothand android miles better than ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,couldve sworn when this was first reviewed it got went on wayback machine to check and was right the original score was so gsma knocked point off for some reason
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,iphone new products are just like old blackberry passport no improvement nothing change with more if you come from super fast charging android phone then yes iphones tend to look slow in charging can put in the same boat pixels and sony phones even samsung phones to some extent but if you come from another iphone and just updating to this model the charging speed is pretty much consistent since years in iphones mean is not good but at least they are consistent in it lol and iphone users do not base their purchase on this fact you just know that your newly iphone will charge in about minutes think beginning with iphone series the charging speed remained pretty much the same
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the gps does not work correctly on this phone often up to km out photo tagging as good useless and trying to navigate with it is impossible
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,have won the apple iphone today on spin the week
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,because iphone screen panels are not that good also white color looks yellowish the pro models with yellow screen tint are made by lg the samsung are much better displays so it just depends on how lucky or unlucky you are as for me was unlucky twice both pro gb natural titanium have the lg displays no more iphones for me
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,lg is supplying displays for the iphone pro series along with samsung samsung is supplying displays for the iphone and plus the lg displays are inferior to the samsung and have yellow tint and color shift when viewed from any direction other than head on turning off true tone night mode or adjusting the color settings does not fix the problem you still end up with little less yellow tint but darker more dirty looking display apple is so intent on reducing their dependency on samsung that they have allowed loyal customers who spent over on premium phone to get an inferior display bought the pro and immediately noticed the yellow tint white looks terrible and the other colors are nowhere near as good as my pro requested replacement but the odds are that ill end up with another lg display by the way used sutools to confirm that this is an lg display in my pro this will be my last iphone was so pleased with my pro and am now so disappointed in my pro knowthis is first world problem but its still huge disappointment hope that this comment is not considered bashing simply want to warn others that if they buy pro or pro max that there is possibility that the display on their expensive phone will look worse than some of the cheap phones have motorola edge which paid for and the colors on the motorola is much better
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,just read the review on the apple iphone pro and wowit sounds like apple has really outdone themselves this time the upgraded camera system and display enhancements seem perfect for anyone into photography or gaming the faster processor is also great bonus for multitasking curious to see how the battery life holds up especially with the new features has anyone here upgraded what do you think of it so far
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,im happy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,which ram uses in pro and pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,not single word in the review here about panoramas wide ultrawide ones no info as to pixel heights as bad as apple themselves but how hard ye reviewers can it be you just do sweep pan with each lens and read the pixel heights from the file info no info on whether you can use styles or change colour balance or over and underexpose panoramas either not word is the robot message on the tshirt true then
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,iphone is not flaghsip and yes is flagship iphone dont have zoom only digital was comparing the and the ultra the is too distant to be considered flagship however the iphone pro has everything the pro max has
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,so the small iphone pro has an equivalent battery life to the ultra and the pro max is more as long as you dont breed voice calls on your phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,so were now paying an extra possibly more for just an increase in battery capacit more they could just not sell the vanilla models but they need cheaper gateway model to get people trapped in the ios ecosystem not that those are by any means cheap
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,dissapointing generation is more gimmick on such small sensor and button isnt reliable image quality and noise performance comparing to flagship vivo oppo or even xiaomi is far behind iphone pro sensor except main are super tiny compared to rivals like budget device best features in new iphone are support jpgxl and more options in editing which could be an update to ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,when they said that samsung disqualified themselves does that mean that theyre way better or way worse
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,congratulations apple you now hold the record for the slowest charging speed in is that what you really want apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,why the sky is not really blue because iphone screen panels are not that good also white color looks yellowish
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,to give due credit its commendable how apple managed to keep this nonmax pro at this size just from the side by side photo with the pixel pro in the competition section of the article it clearly looks smaller and from the rest of the review its more powerful while also lasting longer google is simply unable to compete and in some markets they literally dont even try to
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the galaxy isnt real flagship no more because the distance between itself and th more iphone is not flaghsip and yes is flagship iphone dont have zoom only digital
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,out of those brands only the xiaomi could compete with the iphone pro as small flagsh more xiaomi also has camera lens that fogs up lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the wait for the oppo find ultra review was absolutely criminal the worst part is that more yeah exactly id lost faith years ago and just read the reviews for the sake of it now lol trust smaller tech creators more as they have less bias and just feel more real
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,iphones new photographic style is quite underappreciated because it allows you to change the overall colour balance of the photos without affecting the skin tone change the tonemapping during the preview which is only what pixel has been able to do using the dual exposure slider possibly the biggest advantage over other manufacturers implementations apply these changes after taking photo because each image file contains metadata that essentially allows you to redo and undo the editing in the post without significant loss in quality like how nowadays smartphone manufacturers are now giving people more control over how the final image looks without compromising the image quality consistency in auto mode vivos zeiss colours oppos master mode xiaomis leica modes and presets and now apples new granular photographic styles now all we need is larger possibly mft sensor for the main camera
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,this article seems bit lacking in terms of exploring competition only google and samsung me more out of those brands only the xiaomi could compete with the iphone pro as small flagship it is missed opportunity for them to not have talked about it but at the same time its got limited availability and is overpriced so dont blame them for forgetting do suspect though that the vivo mini will be great product that directly completes with the iphone pro once it releases assuming they didnt cut back on its specs compared to the vivo pro which some people are convinced will be the case with this phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,remember how long it took for the bloody find ultra lol that made me become extremely pess more the wait for the oppo find ultra review was absolutely criminal the worst part is that noticed bunch of other issues that seemed to start happening in and think the site is potentially going to become worse slowly over time the spec inconsistencies between the specs page and the review page is quite jarring have no clue why they havent listed the camera sensors for each camera module if theyre now mentioned in the review some reviews seem obviously rigged because theyve got early review samples and theyre giving good reviews for phone thats obviously terrible cough cough the asus zenfone ultra cough cough and the chat filter thats only become more and more censorious these are just few of the many new problems on this site which is sad to see when its an absolutely amazing database of phones and phone reviews that no other site can rival to anywhere close to the same degree
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,know that but what was referring to is that phones that have been in for review for over more remember how long it took for the bloody find ultra lol that made me become extremely pessimistic about the speed at which reviews of nonmainstream phones come out
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,clicks dude clicks wouldnt mind betting that iphone reviews are up there in traffic more know that but what was referring to is that phones that have been in for review for over month and three weeks before the iphones came in vivo vv pro didnt get the full review and yet the iphone reviews were done in just about week so think that about three weeks wouldve been enough for the vv pro reviews to be finished finished long before the iphones even came in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,damn how fast the iphone reviews be dropping yet other smartphones take months to be fully more clicks dude clicks wouldnt mind betting that iphone reviews are up there in traffic in ways the latest vivo or oppo just cant match besides most people know that by the time the they have gotten done reading review of the latest vivo oppo xiaomi etc then its no longer the latest
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,well its not really every device see in comparison to other users around here more hi there man thanks for the shoutout
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the iphone pro model is the most uninteresting year after year people will rather go for the more pro max is mean at least the pro got telephoto and stainless steel housing for the battery
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,expected way better batterylife from the pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,you could entertain the thought of pro instead of the pro the thing is we don more preach is the best focal length range for portraits imo is just stupidity just there so that people can say that the phone has good zoom range
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ive never been less interested in reading iphones review they have gotten soooooooooo more thanks spending ur time reading boring article
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,most of those features are useless and nobody uses them dont think they care useless or not as long have more feature than iphone so they can just to show off
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the ultra is feature wise still years ahead of the iphone what should they change most of those features are useless and nobody uses them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,exactly bar foldables which are too expensive for everybody what brand is pushing innovation more the ultra is feature wise still years ahead of the iphone what should they change
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,seeing as google samsung even xiaomi are now pushing iphone prices as much as it pains me to more me too
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,do you really mean the same samsung thats been changing almost nothing on its flagship more exactly bar foldables which are too expensive for everybody what brand is pushing innovation anymore while every brand became iphone wanna bes you can make the argument apple now are the ones trying to mix things up wild times
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,theres no excitement for this phone only one or two new specs than the previous what more do you really mean the same samsung thats been changing almost nothing on its flagship phones during the last few years new qualcomm or exynos chip new ultrawide sensor flattened screen and there you go these guys dont even use their best oled panels in their own phones btw it hurts me little to say this but they arent any better than apple nowadays except maybe for giving updates that dont screw with the battery life of their older devices
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,asus has an ultra nobody would cared here if there was no review still no pro who cares about that midranger ultra
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the most important improvement in this years iphones is the battery life everything else is meh and gimmicky including the camera button the ios and apple soc seems to be able to do lot on very little power still the small batteries will probably degrade more quickly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,its true get it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,theyre ultras theyre bound to get clicks whats so hard to understand about that asus has an ultra nobody would cared here if there was no review still no pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,but those chinese ultras that cannot sell units are mainstream theyre ultras theyre bound to get clicks whats so hard to understand about that
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,theyre not mainstream phones so you bet its gonna take long time also got more but those chinese ultras that cannot sell units are mainstream
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,not only those but the vivo and pro too there was also the blackview hero althou more theyre not mainstream phones so you bet its gonna take long time also got question for you why do you favorite each and every device you see lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,and neo not only those but the vivo and pro too there was also the blackview hero although it most certainly wont ever see full review
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,consider that ltpo can not only go up to hz but also go down to hz in usage and hz in more your point being the iphone pro has slightly larger and slightly higher res screen the ish mah battery difference is not enough to give it an advantage against an iphone even if both had hz displays but the has hz display the largest difference can be seen with web browsing imo which is affected by refresh rate and the video playback difference comes down to the additional size and higher res
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,consider the screen refresh rate as well buddy consider that ltpo can not only go up to hz but also go down to hz in usage and hz in aod which is not used in this test buddy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,dynamic island looks really unbalanced now bezels are thinner wish theyd remove the dynamic island as well but im pretty sure theyre saving it for its gonna be soo innovative
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,iphone battery life solid battery life for the size note this is almost as more consider the screen refresh rate as well buddy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ltpo has failed again
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,id say its par with lots of android phone offering gb ill take gb storage any day ov more those are the handsets flooding the secondhand market
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,is it reliable choice after the pro for someone who needs only the basic functions with more its lot of money to put down for basics
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,one product would recommend to everyone on iphone who use screen protector is to buy occushield screen protector it blocks blue light so no eyestrain
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,like to get this phone but some things are holding me back do you face any heating issues more no heating issues with normal use it might warm up bit during gaming or heavy multitasking but nothing alarming the screen feels easy on the eyes especially with eye comfort on the battery easily lasts full day and gb is plenty unless you keep ton of videos its smooth and stable and think youll be happy with it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,phoneandcarguy aug im getting that phone when im literaly in years you said youre now therell be the iphone series though im still using an iphone plus myself might upgrade to an iphone next year
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,im getting that phone when im literaly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,iphone is ip superior up to meters ip dust tight and water resistant immersible up to for min motorola is up to meters ip dust tight and water resistant immersible up to for min worth
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,so got thie iphone pro the os often sticks or lags it looks tiny and really don more keyboards look as does black white ui
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ok this is my new phone ive always owned apple phones back the iphone in my more agree with everything that youre saying my first smartphone was an android and it was full of annoyances there were flashlight apps that wanted access to your contacts and messages never again
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,gb base version apple is sooooooo behind on storage its laughable id say its par with lots of android phone offering gb ill take gb storage any day over gb phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,bought mine with gb and still have enough storage even have lot of pics and vids more thanks just wanna switch to apple cause ios is giving windows frutiger aero vibes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,used cheap android change to premium iphone its night and day more you are right
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,iphone should have hz im looking forward to it because it should be the combination of more it should but weve been saying this for years and yet apple still hasnt brought it to the base model iphone its their way of making you pay extra to get the pro model if you want smallish phone with hz screen refresh rate there is no incentive for apple to put hz panels on the base model iphone as it would take huge chunk of the sales from the pro model and knowing apple they would most likely increase the price as well
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,while people are increasingly looking for lightweight smaller phone apple unnecessarily increased the pros size whoever likes big screen will definitely go for the pro max but the pro should be for those who prefer compact design and inches was more than enough for them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,yes it does take awhile would you know approximately how long will the battery learn from your usage and be optimized
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,recently bought an iphone promy first iphone since the wanted to ask if it is true more yes it does take awhile
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,know people dont like camera bumps but it allows for phone design to be more creative
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,we purchased new iphone pro and pro max the worst of all the iphone cameras horrible focus months of blurry photos regret upgrading to iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,does anyone know why eu sar is such higher comparing to pro and pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,would love to have compact pro phone that is lightweight hoping for iphone mini pro currently the iphone pro is the best smaller flagship smartphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,why iphone pro restarts automaticly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,hello am looking at this device could you let me know what are the drawbacks in your more hi there to answer your question some of the biggest drawbacks of the iphone include the lack of headphoneearphone jack also known as mm jackusers also complain that they experience certain bluetooth issues such as frequent disconnections to name few however ios has recently released which has fixed lot of problems from the previous version of ios but be advised as some issues have not yet been fixed hope this helps
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,scratchable painted titanium no we deserve scratch reststant titanium iphone was more durable than this maybe is on purpose
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,can anyone please tell me the best and correct power adapter for pro ex ww etc thanks ill be suggesting you to go for
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,go for pro max batree decrease very fast not enough for whole day you have to charge time in normal use
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,as retired pro photographer of years be careful to check that the sftware updates are not interfering with and ruining your cameras performance by always updating linked to your pc via usbc cable as wifi is insecure etc had to redo mine with apple tech help twice as an update ruined the focussing abilities of the cameras so if your pictures look lousy soft and well wrong it might not be the hardware but their buggy software after the third try mine now is fine and you will appreciate just how good the cameras really are by using pro res raw in photos because nobody else opens those files yet except adobe think and by choosing the largest file sizes and ordinary jpeg if you try heic and by all means do you will find it does an excellent job up to point the point being the way it drains the colour out of the image am sure lossless xl jpeg is also fine but its the editing software that needs to be updating to apples new standards use dxo labs software for everything it allows me to but they do not even have any profiles for recent iphones at all no dngs in dxo know its joke in poor taste so am stuck with photos which is okish
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,im not really an apple fan im team samsung but my company let me upgrade my iphone to an iphone pro it will be arriving today and im actually looking forward to checking it out anyone who currently owns this phone what are its pros and cons
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,blud doesnt know how to use an iphone those are genuine concerns understand him completely
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,phone with bluetooth wake up apple samsung knows better bro samsung has bluetooth
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,use regulary but battery performance is very bad regularry use only hours continu but drai more same battery life us worst regret buying hope they fix it in the latest update else will switch to android sultra waay better battery life my friends getting days battery life on normal usage without gaming
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,today bought st shift form android smooth in operating much better than any android biggest difference feel otherwise much freedam in android
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,these are completely different devices if youre stuck with apple eco system then more for alarm you can turn it down using the volume bar hotspot never have such issue for transferring files it is best if you are in the ecosystem not really favorable if you have pclaptop also have laptop so usually just send through cloud service like googles
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,apple intelligence feels like budget galaxy ai ios runs pretty good though decent iphone the truth is that theyre both gimmicky and more or less useless but give the edge to apple intelligence because its mostly ondevice and also because it wont hopefully make you pay for it after year
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,thinking of upgrading from iphone to pro but confused because have heard heating and han more test it for yourself before believing haters apple haters are out there
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,hi can anyone recommend an external ssd for this phone would mainly be used for storing vide more why dont ya grab one of these external ssd with price of your choice storing data on external ssd can be potentially good for your privacy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,im super disappointed from this phone would never recommend it to anybody this is my more these are completely different devices if youre stuck with apple eco system then stick with it stuck with android eco the stick with it as well in general android has more freedom such as vpn hotspot sharing can be done without hassle depending on rom though but it can get messy if you dont know where to look for if youre on apple youre basically stuck with only things they give ya which doesnt go along with my logic bro if already paid for the device want my own freedom with it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,using since month camera is very good no battery issues but expected much from apple intelligence which is not up to the mark atm
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,battery capacity is very bad its not bad battery bigger than the iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,if this phone was the same size as the pro would love it but they made it bigger more true
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,for me pm is to big already had plus and is pretty big phone and if thought it was small screen my hands are grateful for this phone is almost perfect size
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,only get pros for tele lens display is just the same as the one found on base hrr okay more ltpo screen in the pro which is not in the
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,wanna enquire about the battery performance how it fares compared to max model is it wise to choose this over max my main concern is battery life rest all can adjust does it last full day like max does or is it better to buy iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the camera the display the refresh rate titan vs allu and much more just for few bucks only get pros for tele lens display is just the same as the one found on base hrr okay convincing argument still insane that people need to pay premium for something that should be given at in the case of gimmick versus good build material that works just as fine yeah no aluminum is still good
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ok friend you use pixel android international
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,same phone but with slightly bigger screen and new button we didnt need
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ultrawide is okay but the sensor isnt cool its quality leaves much to be desired ultra wide is worse than iphone pro apple is committing fraud
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,skip waiting for pro or pro how come high price phone but still like beta tester phone look your competitor samsung already so fast and ahead to development new generation compare to apple lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,id dare say that this is the best phone for videography would recommend for content creation
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,same design very innovative apple prefer android phone with ugly back camera design or just stick with its own identity
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the iphone pro has enough grip for its users to keep it casefree what absolutely not like most devices its very slippery every smartphone needs case these days and preferablyif possible highquality protective one drop tests etc like eg otterboxs defender series that is if you want to keep your device in impeccable condition even almost as good as new for many years to come and without the need for repairs following fall for example
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,in your case if you want to stick with apple theres no point in paying the premium asso more the camera the display the refresh rate titan vs allu and much more just for few bucks
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,apple should fire many staff ios didnt fix many bugs that we known
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,need camera test
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,hey can you sell me your mini in your case if you want to stick with apple theres no point in paying the premium associated with the pros which mostly has to do with the cameras would buy the plain or even the plain the only reason would consider pro in your case is the screen but again dont think it justifies the price differential for your usage profile
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,need your advice im not gamer nor do care that much about camerasi want to upgr more none to be honest
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,in next phone all camera become mega pixel that name is iphone lol this is true haha
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,so pro and pro max both has mm telephoto do they both get potrait
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,from the specifications what could understand is that the thickness of the phone is directly proportional to the loudness had the mini which was not loud enough as it was slim about mm the mini was thicker and hence as loud as the now the pro is less louder than the
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,faster than not bud the pro is faster than the inside the iphone pro the is faster than the inside the iphone all according to apple does that mean the is just as fast as the pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,thanks to everyone who repliedtbh at first was going for the pro but after seeing this httpstomaccomiphonebatterycapacities from to mahi changed my mind vinitrk for done
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,get the iphone the new chip is gonna run faster then the iphone plus the battery more it is not faster than the it is maybe faster according to appld the pro is also faster than the pro which has the same chip as the but that doesnt make any sense no
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the new pixel design shits on this it cant be fashion or trend its just another phone which will be forgotten in the dust phone universe
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,thought only had noticed this dont see the people commenting but its absur more yeah as neutral person who hates both lol never understand why people fansboyingfansgirling to that extent just judge everything objectively lol its not that hard
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,anyone who upgrading to is dumb same like upgrading samsung series to or more better change the baterry for bucks and you have new phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,base gbgb
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,its at aspect ratio instead of just like xiaomi and galaxy this inch only increase the tallness of the phone but maintain same width like iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,you will not help yourself much samsung is even lazyier than apple just ask android boys and more samsung has definitely become lazier than apple just look at the rumors of the and plus the ultra model still gets little treatment the plus still gets something but the entry model is stopped in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ultra wide still has tiny sensor from the last year the competitors have double more ultrawide is okay but the sensor isnt cool its quality leaves much to be desired
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,what time to be alive to see the iphone have more improvement over the galaxy series in th more thought only had noticed this dont see the people commenting but its absurd for the and to have the same triple set of cameras on the back
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,on mm phone is crazy high thats proper brick
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,porky pig at think ill stick with my pro and itll probably have much smaller battery than it could have even with it being smaller than big variant
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,we need new camera setup how many years it is same and same my pro makes almost the same photos as my wifes pro max promax wont be far off pro max too come one apple okey pro pro is great upgrade in other ways and will do it like the thin bezels the sms and imessage satellite feature when full out of coverage or wifi
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,honestly peak iphone has been achieved and am not very much interested in the ai stuff anyw more ai looks like sickness of st century ai ai ai thats so disgusting
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,yes smartphone cameras getting better but smartphone cameras cant beat physics of sensor size and quality lens which costs lens only even after years it will be frame rates increase but not real image quality if they dont increase image sensor size to full frame camera sensor ai makes image look beautiful but thats all you will get from right after camera you cant edit further like camera image like pro photograph these are the real facts about smartphone which will be constant for years and they will tell us smartphone cameras can shoot movies in fact nobody dares to shoot movie with iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,apple missed an opportunity to make the action button also function as fingerprint reader more finally somebody mentioned it that capture button is fine guess if you use the camera lot probably saving that fingerprint scannerpower button feature for future iteration when they rethink about replacing that dynamic island stuff with punch hole waiting for iphone pro reviews on how they will get rid of the heat without heat pipe involved or else that battery will deteriorate quicker so it seems iphone promax owner here
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,not much improvement
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,wont wait to buy this phone have been longing to use it and feel its potentials for me ill wait for or generations to replace my mini yeah cant stand lightning port but upgrading my phone just for more useful port is not worth it my second reason is they dont have smol iphone anymore so ill stick with mini we still need more ram tho for all those ai shenanigans
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,dont understand why apple says the series is built for apple intelligence from the ground up yet they limit the ram to gb which is the bare minimum you need for apple intelligence which is proven fact by apple themselves as they havent upgraded the standard iphone to apple intelligence which has gb of ram and that will have caused some reputation damage yet apple limited even the pro models to gb with the seriesi mean how much would it have cost apple to give them the extra gb of ram to make it gb and really future proof the devices and improve reputationabout dollarsseems wasted opportunity to me by apple especially as they already two years behind google and samsung regarding generative aisales will be down because of this as it needs gb to run smooth without bottlenecksand the reality is the best iphone you can buy is still the iphone pro max in greenits not been successfully bested yet
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,apple pro is in flagship category apple is in flagship category apple is in flagship category apple is in flagship category apple is in flagship category apple is in flagship category apple is in flagship category so iphone iphone propro max the only revolution apple has made in history is touch screen since the first iphone in the world of button phones today every company use touch screen the same boxy flat frame design like iphone same ai faster processors advanced operating system best cameras big batteries all phones are simple to use the next company to make revolution will make button less phone screen less phone chargingless phone which means to put those chips inside our hands and head
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,if will have enough money will buy it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,so were back to almost just like iphone pro seemingly because of the tetrap more like the dimecions are mm mm so its so small that it should not weight
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,no way in hellget minimum in better if you wold be keep it for longer have gb ram gb storage
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,hello gsmarena dont you have social media handles like so that we can say our opinions in real time instead of coming to the website
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,honestly all brands should stop selling phones with only gb of storage unless they include more wont wait to buy this phone have been longing to use it and feel its potentials
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,im really shocked about series they are really joking with their trusted customerai now apple intelligence wtf okh just wait for months the boss is coming
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,it has it is now the most advanced iphone ever as per tim every year they say same
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,if anyone knows what kind of camera sensor is used in main camera imx dont thi more its upgraded version of former one with faster readout speeds
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,is gb enough google honestly all brands should stop selling phones with only gb of storage unless they include microsd card slot
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,hey it looks similar to pro which looks similar to pro which is basically pro with more well said
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,everyone whos typing it looks the same as pro pro etc etc what do you expect it to become the design has been perfected and apple is not messing their recipe porsche makes the same design for the the last years but yet every genre is different car
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ive seen realme using this wallpaper before they share each other arent they coz live moon wallpaper is firstly on iphone then goin to xiaomi and then last to realme
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,actually who needs mostly usb typec gen is android user because many android user still copy their files to laptop the iphone user just simply use airdrop or icloud
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,for how many years are they going to use the same design still using iphone pro design in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,very good camera combination main uwa and zoom wish main camera was at least mm fl more ultra wide still has tiny sensor from the last year the competitors have double the size the sensor also zoom sensor is extremely tiny so dont expect good quality
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,any prediction on battery life its the only thing putting me off short than iphone plus
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,now the pro lost the only thing that make it special which is size now if we want compact light weight premium smartphone we go for
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,mp is like buying galaxy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,no ones talking about the mm thickness thats as big as samsung midranger one thick boi
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,its going to be up to mah thought it would be
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,so we can play rdr on iphone already guys
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,so what is the battery capacity for pro its going to be up to mah
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,another nonsense from apple from few years same design not much improvement basic models more you will not help yourself much samsung is even lazyier than apple just ask android boys and they will tell or you can also read comments like on this gsm recent article samsung galaxy ultra to have upgraded ultrawide camera only
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,is good gb storage on apple is gb enough google
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,still producing gb flagships in smh pixel series
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,same crap every year and this is coming from an iphone user boring and repetitive another nonsense from apple from few years same design not much improvement basic models are still hz in lolz switch to sultra
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,been holding off on buying the ultra for this but im just gonna wait for the or pro instead its the samsung for me at this time specs wise
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,gb in sorry no at least gb minimum or gb recommended gb only for those more yeah rely on cloud and keep getting gb
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,you say same crap again but you will be the first who buy it you will be the first fan if you have enough money
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the annual update speed of this brands phones is not as fast as that of teenage boys body
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ugly overratedover priced piece of phone phone for the poor people
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,how about its ram ai needs gb at least
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,compare iphone pro to iphone pro there is hardly difference been the same for years now whats the point steve jobs innovation definitely missing here he would not have let it get this boring he would have changed all this probably complete different style of phone by now
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,ultra wide is still horrendous
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,normal changes in this iphone lineup not major changes in series
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,have nausea of this iphone form in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,fps
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,awsome
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,difference is that it has worse display than the pro max ver its not worse its smaller many people prefer smaller
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,the comment section of iphone pro max goes burrrr cause pro max profile is already here for months thats why it has many comments
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,like new pro only dollars tax
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,gyatt phone ngl
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro,nice smartphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,oh my god this is my crushed phone in the world promised
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is year over year performance increase incremental
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,liked phone pro max if need the help we have an iphone pro max please
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,your dumb if you think pixel would give you an iphone experience lol even huawei pro more totally agree with you on this at this rate with the pixels theyll always lag behind by years in catching up with other manufacturers tried an for week sent it back and went back to my pm my experience on one ui wasnt exciting had an that pretty much performed almost the same
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im using iphone pro max but it doesnt have sim slotits esim
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pic pro max cash on delivery
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,people should stop see this as battle between iphone pro max and samsung is more of an ios vs andr more your dumb if you think pixel would give you an iphone experience lol even huawei pro released years ago is smoother than any pixel devices till date pixels are bad as far as usability is concerned bad chip bad thermal and rubbish animation would rather use an oppo oneplus or samsung last choice than pixel
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,think samsung did better job than bitten iphone pro max iphone pro max pro max will beat samsung ultra more people should stop see this as battle between iphone pro max and samsung is more of an ios vs android and in this regard iphone pro max comes on top at least vs samsung because they have full control over the software and the hardware no missing pieces no extra tweaks needed no doubled or extra apps android is done by google and then comes samsung and try to tweak it to their phones that is why for me the only android phones will ever buy in future are pixels ones because those come closest to iphone experience sadly google invest more in the software and majority of their profit come from data mining so their pixels phones cant compete hardware wise with the iphones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ghana
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,which phone camera most better front and back also samsung galaxy ultra or iphone pro max pro max think samsung did better job than bitten iphone pro max iphone pro max pro max will beat samsung ultra think but still iphone pro max will not be able to afford pen for their phone by the time will come
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,sounds like coming strait out the marketing kitchen from cupertino
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,for me talking about iphone feels like talking with main topic of flagship phone class as they normally produce their phone with newest technology that put them constantly at the top among other phone manufacturers although within nowadays extreme competition not only me think but also other people will always think phone out of iphone pro max neither midrange nor lowend one thing for instance that observed so far is the maintaining of hexa core processor used in their phone while others are already octa core as standard but their phone performance still manageably high
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,to put supercharger on it and make over whp and make it totally unreliable
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no much difference with the the expected something more effective more faster and design difference the noice on low light and the freezing can be annoying
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if it works well why not if can get hp from engine going fast why would need more to put supercharger on it and make over whp
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,there are iphone pro problems have been coming across lot of evidence of blue noise in lowlight shots and the thing freezing up and refusing to work to me this could just be the damage caused by packing it intio the smallest flimsiest possible box the box has no protection for the cameras lenses no protection against shock now see why cex has so many brand new phones listed secondhand as or quality as people return their to iphone pro max in droves and of course iphone pro max then has to dump them somewhere it might be good idea for the company to actually make their own phones every component is just bought in from other manufacturers sensors lenses circuit boards batteries etc none of them made by iphone pro max at all but the boxes are iphone coffins anyway
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,something does need to be said aboutformats prefer phone to have screen that can be cropped to and to the same shape as mm film camera this costs nothing as you just alter the view using your os software but it does control how you look and see the world using the phone think that it is really high time iphone pro max et al all decided to let us choose what shape we want our stills and videos in they can do as after all the videos are but as our widescreen monitors and tvs are so should the phone be with the default for stills with an option as though its fine for portraits and product shops its squareish shape is static and doe not fit well with snapshots ot travel pictures imho
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,welcome to sony wheres sony
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,who updated their iphone today lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,experience android to iphone pro max short about me this is my first iphone and ive bee more the force is strong in you but you are not jedi welcome to the dark side
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,in few days monday actually am getting my iphone pro max gb sim ver no one has been harder critique of the iphone pro max cult than me only to mention that currently my iphone pro max almost year old makes the best pictures ever seen in another hand my daily driver for the last two years redmi note great battery still going strong but schwach soc performance not surprised when the fact its only buck of cost charging charging cycle on my ip pro max and still goes strong cell is made by sunwoda in the year compared here with pro max indeed justified the price of in my region why bought because of simontanious open windows ip pro max by its design and the fact its nm process its soc will definitely seeve another years without any compromise but still love my hyper os more than ios see yall monday
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,android is os quit lying iphone user yeah console yourself whatever helps you sleep at night
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well after long and patient repeated phone calls about sweep panoramas the upshot is that the more the other thing is that sadly you are unable to modify the settings before you create panorama you cannot under or overexpose extremely useful when the start of your sweep may be radically darker or brighter than other parts you cannot apply any of the iphone pro max settings varying tone their presets or color temperature etc you get an exposure and colour balance that is automatic with the iso and shutter speed fixed at the first frame and anything you want to change has to be done in photos or an imageediting programme afterward and on this point you might like to check to see whether your image editing programme even iphone pro max photos as your current os has it is able to edit iphone pro maxs pro res raw rawheif and the new jpeg formats
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nah the pro max gets over full days from average use and other review sites have said more mean full not using anything days
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,whilst we all can see unboxing videos we have no part in their content by this mean the boxes themselves iphone pro max has chosen to place three camera lenses butted up against the external sheet of cardboard that is the top of the box the box itself is as tiny as possible it has no foam padding protection at all is barely twice the thickness of the phone itself does it ensure you get your new iphone in perfect condition
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dude theres literally no excuse for phone to be equipped with only gb of ram if it works well why not if can get hp from engine going fast why would need with hp
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you are more like shareholder than consumer you defend something that is not beneficial more have iphone and android both and enjoy both for the strength those offer me this comment section is mostly biased towards android and they just regurgitate what they are told am just against the flock who blindly follows for the same reason really dislike the teens with blue bubble green bubble stuff the test that shows faster charging doesnt degrade the battery are dubious and their test methodology leaves gaps no wonder xiaomi redmi user wont like pro max if you know you know
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this isnt badly optimized android phone gb is more than enough you android users are more it shows that you have absolutely no clue about how ram works nor about the cost for the manufacturer even samsung who sparingly upgrade their phones have surpassed gb already
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,all that and sense of style and well the screen calibration the color accuracy more well what do we have here sony xperia vi aficionado sonny no iphone pro max intelligence to check xperia increases internal memory so not buying phone with more memory point why do comment then reearch will invest probably week before upgrade in android which the vast majority will be not just seeing the bullet point next to the price in phone store be it android or iphone pro max in this nick ackerman video he compares the iphone pro max to the ultra he comments you are not making mistake picking one over the other am not one do accept that many some are equally with either httpsmyoutubecomwatchvjxwyxtbog people especially the iphone pro max vineyard dwellers fixated on benchmarks processors the nm soc is beast both antutu and geekbench iphone pro max rules it is predicted that qualcomms next will be nm benchmarks alone are criteria both these phones display similar speeds you are not be able to do something else waiting irrespective of the benchmark this is the nd review where only watt iphone pro max not been ahieved as well as the sub mah battery for me this year iphone pro max has made more individual tweaks which seem greater than expected the point already made is you can and do see these features already in say sony and samsung flagship for less than iphone pro max buying not bidding samsung ultra only this year increased the base memory gb from gb ram if gb is not enough close some apps also here complaints still re iphone pro max battery especially the amount of time for full charge from flat who fully depletes battery and given what the vast majority charge good in minutes make this low priority many sleep for more than hours each day in that regard if you cant charge your phone youre probably swimming is there anybody leaving their house not fully charged no cable and no access for hours iphone pro max have never had the removable batteries iphone pro max ecosystem is you pay high price for more memory and have to pay again to back it to the cloud even though not launched doubt that iphone pro max intelligence will offer anything new or available uniquely to iphone ios didnt either every year you get the report iphone arent selling well then later record sales follow you want my prediction no guarantee before you see this in an ice universe tweet iphone sales in india will skyrocket the biggest yoy regional sales increase will be recorded in india for me however am aware of the iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,reviewer is gushingpraising at every instance rather than reporting things as they are
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,sim ejection tool so this is review of nonus model
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphones are beginning to become interesting with these new sensors but as with last years tony northrup adds wise words of caution because they are of mp resolution when using the lens at its own focal length but that resolution disappears rapidly as you zoom down almost to nothing before the zoom uses the next lens in the series and then you are back up to mp again mp is quadpixel not real measure of resolution though interpolation on the main cam appears to yield adequate mp results but does this apply to the ultrawide as well am asking have nokia from it has the same actual mp resolution as these new iphones but only one lens and its only good in daylight where it easily equals an iphone mp gives much greater detail so older quadbayer phones with mp will easily outshine any iphone but that of course does not account for the iphones amazing video and their unique feature which is adequate ultrawide panoramas with the mm lens say adequate as contacting iphone pro max have no reliable info on their pixel height vital to know how well they fill your screens one advisor said another the horizontal vertical size and yet another advisor claimed however even supposing the highest figure to be the true one we needs must take into consideration that mm lens reduces image magnification at the same distance to well under half that of the mm main cam lens thus be be able to see the detail and to record it pixel height needs really to be in excess of pixels on screen get from my lg but it is too small on imac and that is with mm lens please if you can try one out post the results
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,camera performance is on par with su and pixel pro xl but definitely not on the same level more or year only simple camera
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,seriously start suspecting battery testing here is not close to real life usage by sign more nah the pro max gets over full days from average use and other review sites have said the battery life is outstanding think this is just you problem
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,help not people arguing intensively about sony xperia vi being mentioned detailed out of more all that and sense of style and well the screen calibration the color accuracy the twostep camera button not that youve mentioned the details the gorgeous frontfacing speakers the ability to add tb the jack for professional headphones true they need an adapter the clean android experience the perfectly design of the screen with no cameraisland or similarly ridiculous nonsensical marketing strategies and so much more must repeat myself did you know that the image sensors on iphones are sony sensors that should give you sense of perspective and the chance to tone it down little and also the chance to spend your last years economies on new iphone dixit
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,unless youre truly adventurous and switch brands like me love both ios and android often switch from pixel to iphone and vice versa love the camera and good price on pixel but love the premium feeling and the user experience on iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,generally do not use my iphone pro max for taking pictures unless the lighting conditions more so you like the fake artificial colours that samsung is obsessed with youre real connoisseur of photography
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,to be fair almost all iphone owners will only buy new iphone and not switch to android that more unless youre truly adventurous and switch brands like me love both ios and android
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,having looked at these images on my computer screen they look awful the pixel level detail is more generally do not use my iphone pro max for taking pictures unless the lighting conditions out door or indoor are good enough since it looks bit dull and warm though details are good enough but my samsung galaxy ultra always my first one to take pictures irrespective of the conditions though it gives more saturated and vibrant dynamic range look it still beats iphone pro max in many instances but iphone video capturing really the best compared to samsung ultra for still photography prefer samsung
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,camera much better than samsung series why samsung didnt do nothing to improve processing maybe mpx can improve something
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,there is also report that god told his angels to protect those batteries you mentioned thats more you are more like shareholder than consumer you defend something that is not beneficial to consumers with logic that is wrong there are tons of pages on the web that explain faster charging doesnt damage the battery and there is none supporting your comment and yet you mocking others for saying the facts no one is telling you to buy from other brands just dont spread misinformationand maybe try reading about things before commenting about them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,even if it was an amazing phone overall this review still seems bit preapproved for the lack of better term sponsored
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,slightest of critic towards iphone pro max products and ypur comment will be deleted this site lost more are you being serious dude id agree moderation on this site is uneven at best but just take look at this thread easily of it is critical of this device and by extension iphone pro max and so far this is one of the more balanced iphone pro max threads on the site
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,oh btw this doesnt seem like review its an ad for iphone pro max look elsewhere for credible reviews pretty much all of them are ads for iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,when we all know that it degrades battery there have been no reports of batteri more there is also report that god told his angels to protect those batteries you mentioned thats why it doesnt degrade despite charging with charger
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the camera control key can do bunch of stuff from immediately starting the camera taking photos or capturing videos swit ching cameras zoom levels exposure or bokeh and more twostep autofocuscapture functionality is in the works too there is an extra space in switching
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,welcome to international prices ridiculously overpriced by iphone pro max samsung google and chinese more true the alternative is buying phone that has micro sd card slot like asus rog or sony xperia
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,having faster charging is good to have not important when we all know that it degrades batt more when we all know that it degrades battery there have been no reports of batteries degrading faster because of fast charging just reports of iphone batteries degrading from slow charging iphones batteries are so bad they degrade fast whether or not its being charged fast or slow
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,design has special language look at all those hideous cars trying to look like futuristic more that bmw xm series and the new are such tragedies it makes me so sad
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im getting tired of minimal upgrades from iphones each year may we know who forced you to buy an iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,believe there are engineers at iphone pro max who measured how long battery lasts for all different more if lot of people are happy with iphone pro max products then they are doing something right just someone without real job who is playing games like pokemon on hisher phone whole day is judging iphone pro max because it doesnt come with charging speed if this isnt funny what is
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,true but ive never seen an iphone which operates faster have better colors and works more if you play so much games why not buy rog ally or steam deck
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont particularly entertain your language am not your pal and no don more you dont entertain making sense either it seems
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,oh you are welcome to believe whatever you like pal and you are also right in that those poin more dont particularly entertain your language am not your pal and no dont sell these phones and yes am so utterly taken by my sony xperia vi it is such an amazing phone also believe that the new iphone max pro is so much better than your dreams you must be young
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,first sl mercedes was beatiful and still is after decades so good design take the test of time design has special language look at all those hideous cars trying to look like futuristic but eventually look bland the new bmws are like that they change the design to make it look worse and ugly we need nice looking smartphones changing for the sake of changing shouldnt happen
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,charge while youre asleep and then charging speed should never matter wh more having faster charging is good to have not important when we all know that it degrades battery please dont tell that chinese manufacturers do it well cause no one beats physics but for sure you are free to choose if you need it or not
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,sorry if ive mislead you the facts are its feat that iphone pro max has manage more oh you are welcome to believe whatever you like pal and you are also right in that those points some of which are just your opinion are entirely irrelevant again why are we discussing sony phone on an iphone review article you selling these things or something
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,send link to consensus of the reviews really dude and didnt say the battery li more sorry if ive mislead you the facts are its feat that iphone pro max has managed to score so well with this phone given the resolution the refresh rate and the battery this is excellent in itself its fact that sony has better battery life in both scenarios from one charge to another and in the long run as already proven neither vi nor pro max charge fast most of the chinese flagship phones today are in different league if youve witnessed phone being charged in minutes you know what mean but it doesnt actually matter we too charge hours every night thats plenty of time for charging our phones too the review mentions no competition whatsoever because the review is biased in that respect mentioning only other iphones is proof in itself had you read my notes on the xperia vi page you would have noticed an entire list of cons the storage it cost me euros tb sdxc card so my sony xperia now has tb at fraction of the price you get to pay for tb iphone imagine that smithravis comment is very relevant for storage prices kudos the xperia camera is in different league and believe the review is biased in this respect too by the way did you know that iphone image sensors are sony sensors but all these are irrelevant believe you must buy new iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,tb costed me around yikes welcome to international prices ridiculously overpriced by iphone pro max samsung google and chinese phones one must stay in us for cheap prices and taxes will quote my own comment samsung tb iphone pro max tb sony gb can add tb sd card which costs again over pixel tb or even chinese smartphones like huawei costs almost for gb and oneplus even laptops now days costing around with decent oled screen and chip gone are the days barrier now companies became greed inflations is smaller and approaching slowly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,can you send link to that consensus because what said was true however dont bel more send link to consensus of the reviews really dude and didnt say the battery life of the xperia vi was bad if fact dont really know why we are discussing it at all here oh wait its because you chimed in to mention how it scores higher on gsmarenas battery test why who knows nobody was asking how they compared the review itself doesnt mention the sony and this isnt comparison article between the two no having written extensively over on the xperia vi page seems you just werent done waffling on about how taken your are with it eh
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,youre definitely seeing stuff if you want to see horror that look at what xiaomi more wrong again iphone pro max and google fell off together with samsung in late to
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,again cant belive it no better battery life evev mah rise well nothing teally new fron model hmmi think pass looks still thst stay android lets say iphone pro max have one and last change morei mean incoming seriesthen bye butits have inside selfie cam and might also only esim choicei dont like itjust only spy meaning bye iphone pro max im very dissapointed
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,was shocked by the picture quality its really terrible iphone pro max is clearly doing someth more youre definitely seeing stuff if you want to see horror that look at what xiaomi produces iphone pro max and google are the most subdued when it comes to processing remember you can always add more but you cant take it back once its baked in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,charge while youre asleep and then charging speed should never matter of course peo more charge while youre asleep and then charging speed should never matter what if you forget to plug it in before going to bed or if you had to use the phone during the night get up in the morning plug my phone into the charger and it is fully charged by the time finished making breakfast
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont know man may be little much still think ultra is slightly better phone and after an update beats the iphone in battery life for hours or so it also has better screen and camera like the chip but everything else is nothing special comparing to the last years pro max if it cant beat the ultra now then the ultra will beat it easily not on this page of course lol if they implement everything samsung said
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gsmarena unnecessarily gives high ratings to iphones and xiaomi
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gsmarena is biased those selfies look soft yeah one of smallest front cam sensors in flagships if not even the smallest
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yeah im never trusting this site for calling this design beautiful when its over more first sl mercedes was beatiful and still is after decades so good design take the test of time
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its impressive that iphone pro max now has two new soc for iphones its not cut down pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,have consensus is that battery life on the vi is very good indeed though not up there wi more can you send link to that consensus because what said was true however dont believe it can last for two days as some sony branches claim but it can easily outlive the other flagships out there dont believe that the phone is without fault slow charging vs chinese flagships not sure how it would deal with hours of intense gaming not gamer myself but am sure about the numbers shared oh and you should see the screen check the xperia vi comments section have written there extensively my oppinion on the phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well it is in my pocket you dont have to believe me check independent reviews have consensus is that battery life on the vi is very good indeed though not up there with your outlandish claims maybe tone it down bit next time you can make point without going so obviously over the top
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,surch large phone and iphone pro max can not even cram mah battery in that thing others woul more mha can play game for is not good as mha play lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,remember being so excited with pro max pro max and pro max but now don more why the
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hours charging is not con well at least it wasnt pro either
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its amusing how when gsmarena reviews some android flagship they always suggest in the more that is probably because now you can wrap an iphone in huawei mate xt to further protect it and this could be slightly baffling for potential iphone buyers
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wow what an interesting load of total boleri mean anecdote guess wed better just go ahea more well it is in my pocket you dont have to believe me check independent reviews
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,either you replied to wrong comment or you didnt read what said at all because your more add to your understanding my next comment the one you replied to with dot and the fact that iphone pro max offers closed environment that plus small incremental upgrades high price and the year old marketing strategy of announcing already existing technology as innovation is what makes this environment luxury prison my comment does not refute your point it deconstructs it by exemplifying its lack of solid ground
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yeah no hours to charge is crazy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,how iphone with lesser battery capacity gives more battery backup compared to android phones more its the result of more efficient chip and ios having less background processes that drains the battery android is the more feature rich os but having more features drain the battery more quickly usually turn off all things google on my phone and that helps tremendously with battery life
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont get it year after year iphone pro max adds little to their phones and they get good reviews more think its been pretty similar for the last three generations of flagships from all the big three brands not major hardware improvements apart from the processor going from sultra to ultra and from xiaomi ultra to ultra doesnt make the new flagships bad though just no great leaps in technology
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,your limitation is form of security if youd be in prison and youd draw wind more either you replied to wrong comment or you didnt read what said at all because your comment isnt refuting my point in any way
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,again xperia vi has better battery score yesterday for me left home with batte more wow what an interesting load of total boleri mean anecdote guess wed better just go ahead and declare the xperia vi the battery king of the whole wide world now hadnt we
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,actually not resolution phone makers advertise is like they had full screen like sony an more nick forgets that sony has just gone down from nick should simply use an iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone is pushing an larger display that has more pixels while carrying smaller batt more actually not resolution phone makers advertise is like they had full screen like sony and nubia they ignore the lost surface where cutouts are
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pretty cool phone no doubt but hours to charge xiaomi phones charge like minutes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,inch and you cant even use split screen
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,woah battery edurance is like over better than su and other android flagships but have more again xperia vi has better battery score yesterday for me left home with battery at around in the morning made my calls and chats used my my xperia for for gps guiding made pics most needed adjustments etc listened to streaming music used it at full brightness and it ended up at with battery do you actually understand this it felt could not drain the battery during the day
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you should start using dmark steel nomad wildlife on ios is capped at fps maybe unlimited option removes that limit
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,cant wait until when snapdragon gen finally matches the pros performa more youre rambling about something that you have no idea about good job
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yet another same looking boring phone but it has new button wow
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the so called new ultrawide camera produces disastrous images micron pixels could not hel more micrometer pixel mp sensor would be around oveimxgn size
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,cameras never improve
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post gsma didnt have any early access to these devices and gave the iphone only so what you say seems little unlikely
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,your not wrongbut wholey battery life is nuts thats good score but sony xperia vis score is still better
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,not the best iphone what they made tested iphone pro max vs iphone pro max camera was better in second detail that dont like in new iphone that need to use hands for taking photo with that new button
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no ai should be pro other brands should follow
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no ai intelligence at launch for eu may be never ok so we europeans out buy the or which are much better deal and get of the experience for lower price
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hours to fully charge flagship usd phone this is really joke even samsung is doing better
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,great option for older iphone users not great for newer ones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if the sustainability and temperature are good im willing to let go of the low score on the tests and look at geekbench glazing iphone pro max lmao how is that even possible
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yeah know people who buy iphones usually arent people to look upto about proper spend more am in favor of only iphones per year all them same size something like and pro as xr with latest internals as replacement and pro replaces pm
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,with that battery google ought to be ashamed of themselves losing to iphone pro max on battery life more your not wrongbut wholey battery life is nuts
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so spite the vanilla lacking hz screen and not whole lot more no check out the verdict section the gets and the pro max gets ok then
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bought it sold it after week because of stuttering of ui its not as smooth as it was
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,latest pro max always outsell previous when both are sold simultaneously even if lastest is more yeah know people who buy iphones usually arent people to look upto about proper spending habits but still this year more than any other is just awful pro max is such cool device compared to this especially if it can be had for far lower
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thats sad that you dont make any more effort to describe the speakers quality since some test just theyre loud and sound good for exemple on the pro max the kind of surround sound that it provide is one of the main point that make them that good
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,whats the point of having high res uw cam it just seems like scam to more latest pro max always outsell previous when both are sold simultaneously even if lastest is not worth over previous and price difference is start may be slower but then they buy more when previous is out of stock be sure or pmwill be most sold phone of among all brands the slim air is tipped to cost more than pm with worse hardware media will be drooling on it because of its design and tell people it is worth having
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the first iphone series that takes good natural photos without massive over sharpening
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,at the pro max captures decent detail its roughly on par with the likes of the galaxy ultra or the pixel pro xl its just that the iphone has noisier more blotchy presentation than those other two the iphone is full of fake details just like previous iphones at this can be seen in the image of the clock or in comparisons from other reviewers
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,forgot to mention some video modes require external storage which is failure
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,jeez those signs in the lowlight pictures with both the main camera and the telephoto theyre beyond horrendous and look like they came out of midranger from think its both lens issue and processing issue here
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,are you afraid of put android phoness ultra on competition page lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,remember sonys design is outdated iphone pro max copying the flatscreen and camera button is innovative
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,mah and wh means voltage is around the maximum mah before the wh threshold is reached at that voltage is mah pro max is rumored to be around so wh could already be reached with pro max if the capacity continues to increase from there on the next options are either dual cell and in that case think its possible that apple would give dual cell to the smaller model as well to reach and advertise faster charging speeds or thinnerlighter design id personally appreciate thinner and lighter but the camera capabilities of the standard model are good enough for me so if they went with thin and light on the standard models like they already plan to do with air if that would expand to the inch that would be great im fine if the pro models are thicker and heavier for extra battery runtime and charge speed the strategy could be like with macbook air and macbook pro the cheaper models are very thin and light the pro models are thicker and heavier but with better specs it would be perfect in my option if they had display size spread like on the macbooks those have and on the air and and on the pro if iphone was and on the standard and and on the pros there would be something for everyone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,okay lets check the facts most popular most sold phone iphone which brand does more agree with you the only part that apple lacks is ai but still how many people want and watchd oes ai ads and they just dont use those tools mean dont even use them come from flagship androids yes they are cool for party trick and everyday life this not impacted by any means but iphone impacted my life signifantly battery easy of use quality of apps made only for one os with one brand using it same apps for android are buggy camera in social networks poor quality etc apple services well above googles etc ios is simply perfect simple yet advanced and does everything the way want it and lets not forget what do you see in peoples hands iphones its their and mine choise too so iphone just wins and know why because it just works the way its intended to
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,makes large detailed excellently exposed stitched ultrawide panorama pictures and good enough pro res raw ordinary photos its colour is usually so well balanced and exposed in panorama mode that basic adjustments yield results that are entrancing imho have no even tried video yet but as it is the only smartphone able to do ultrawide panoramas bar couple of samsungs this alone is reason to prefer it above any other machine
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,total joke of phone gb ram joke gaming performance joke battery size joke ho more okay lets check the facts most popular most sold phone iphone which brand does sell more and more phones each year effectively growing and surpassing android iphone do you see people using android no you see iphone hz on iphone is smoother than hz on android this is fact pro is years ahead of anything android will have until like pro gpu is the fastest mobile gpu ever made on pair with meanwhile androids best cant even beat nvidia ios obliterates android iphone screen is years ahead of whatever android has iphone processor is at least years ahead of whatever android has so to sum it up iphone is the best android is sinking and soon going to be completely abandoned and discounted cant wait
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,have shigoshi xl its better than iphone because its excellent performance its made by halolan jalolan company
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you are talking non sense read on internet also the number issue on pro max is the batter more so youre experience as non user of the phone is better than the experiences of actual users of the phone lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,am getting just awesome battery performance in my pm desert think it all depends on ty more this has been my best buy from apple awesome battery performance im heavy user but get day and half of use everything else is just flawless its beast of phone good cameras and all couldnt have asked for more
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its an absolut great phone but the only problem is that its too overpriced and need to pay for most of the things but instead they are working on ai
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,tegra cpu is always kind of bad look at switch and switch switch used old cores more and to play the mario and zelda remakes do you need more and other nonnintendo games have software limit to run
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,based on my experience tegra doesnt have app compatibility issues because the phone com more tegra cpu is always kind of bad look at switch and switch switch used old cores with bad node and switch uses ac cores which are fine but clocked very low due to again bad node nm in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no radio instant rejection
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,because they arent greedy and that reason alone is why mediatek doesnt get much app support unlike the snapdragon and the apple chipsets
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,most phones dont have tegra chips anymore and yes tegra is the worst in app compatibility based on my experience tegra doesnt have app compatibility issues because the phone company has stop using them after apple introduced the processor they were looking for company that could match the bit processor of the iphone and nvidias cpu department couldnt catch up in time
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my very first apple phone and to be honest really hope the next update the thermal managemen more the cameras are goodits point and shoot device the color is not accurate but sharpness is good as for thermals dont game on mobile devicei find it cool most of the time its little sluggish for me when type can feel the delayits too much
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,what adapter youre using to charge your iphone pro max apple or or any other more he dont have iphonemine only charge most of the time and its takes forever to fully charge it will only be fast on the fist to percentafter that goodluck
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,not exactly both iphones and stock android devices can potentially be tracked or monitored to more there are some android forks thats focus towards privacylike eos this are privacy oriented software forks for androids so tell nowdoes ios is better than android towards privacyabsolutely noso your claim that ios is gear mored towards privacy is completely lie as told you android you have freedomios youre in prison controlled by your apps
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my question is whether or not ios is more secure from government invasiveness than android is more not exactly both iphones and stock android devices can potentially be tracked or monitored to some extent true privacyfocused phones are rare these days blackberry was one of the last major brands to prioritize privacy but they unfortunately didnt last long after that shift in todays market complete privacy is difficult to guarantee regardless of the device
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,privacy is just gimmick we all know that when government intervene youre data is not safe more my question is whether or not ios is more secure from government invasiveness than android is now is it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,every bit of software has its own caveats and so on the security isnt always necessaril more privacy is just gimmick we all know that when government intervene youre data is not safe besides everyone is guilty of collecting data from the users whether ios or android as for the optimization thing dont feel my pro max is faster and more stable than my samsung to be honesteven when typing can feel the sluggishness of the iphone the animations also is slow and lack smoothness when scrolling on the uias if its working only on hz mode noticed also bugs on the browser not displaying ui elements when using ios browserlike now while type cant see the submit button in my pro max so am not convinced that iphone is more optimized software
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,absolutely righti own pro max and sultra can comfirm this is real ios is prison lik more every bit of software has its own caveats and so on the security isnt always necessarily against scammers and hackers despite the security against those gradually improving its more about privacy from government im of the opinion that android generally is better and more capable featurewise it gets jackhammered otherwise as yes it might not be as optimized as you wouldve expected but android stutters much much more an example is know people that still daily and xs am of the opinion that apple as an ecosystem its good but they like locking you in there and thats not good personally have mixed opinions on both and have considered switching to some sort of iphone for about month bc of privacy and itd last longer than most android phones with the exception being su su or zfold those are my big three candidates ios privacy optimisation longevity android malleability capability
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple is premium phone but still not available hi res audio output hardware capability
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im looking for new phone as my old phone huawei pro already stop providing updates more go for google pixel pro xl it has very advanced software support
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,prefer ultra than this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,was android user recently switch to ios iphone pro max im fully satisfied nice build quality good battery backup no lag
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no ios kills apps in background unlike android that is why you have gb ram in some android more actually doesnt kill apps it stops the app to do background activities but know one day left hidden game open background used the phone whole day the next day when accessed hidden app section found that the game was already open where left off so
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gb from iphone is equivalent to gb ram from android ios has better optimization no ios kills apps in background unlike android that is why you have gb ram in some android phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so sad it still has only gb ram while some lower midrange android can go up to gb xiaomi more gb from iphone is equivalent to gb ram from android ios has better optimization
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,will the pro max has better battery than pm should get this or wait not in hurry tho the iphone pm battery is indeed longer lasting but we are in meetings all day using laptopsdesktops and only check our phones during meals if you just keep yourself online it is really fine
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,faster at dying yes ok dude unless you take good care of your phone which your supposed to then it wont die fast and idk if ur talking abt battery or durability of the phonebut both of them supposed to be taken care ofyou spent money on phone doesnt mean can js go throw it or drop it whenever you wantbozo
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,liquid glass is so incomprehensibly ugly and unreadable it makes me want to switch to android more it was called developers beta for reason it is still work in progress nobody forced you to install ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,doesnt matter how much you like your android the iphone pro max is still faster than more faster at dying yes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,please god save my pm from ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you are outsider almost everyone uses iphones its true that apple leads the american market they have over of the market share as recently as however android rules the global market with over percent of the market share so americans love their iphones while the rest of the world has moved on at the end of the day who the hell cares buy whats right for you
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple iphone will never be better than android phones have android phone called inf more you do realize that you are comparing it to flagship phone right
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nope its just that apple has lot of money to pay for the devs something that android more most phones dont have tegra chips anymore and yes tegra is the worst in app compatibility
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yes both use the same architecture and dont support bit so how come mediatek doesn more because they arent greedy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the global market share of android is still higher than ios so united states is not the only more apple pays more money on devs than on android and since android allows you to install games and apps from third party app stores it also allows pirated games to be installed on android no wonder the government is pressuring apple to allow third party app stores on ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,mediatek diminesty and apple are based armva archetecture and both processors do more yes both use the same architecture and dont support bit so how come mediatek doesnt pay devs to make an app exclusively on mediatek processors how come some games on playstore requires you to have snapdragon processor and not something else
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,most people are gonna use social media which all of them are compatible with android and isnt that the same thing on iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,there just making it ios only because they think that ios is the dominant os nope its just that apple has lot of money to pay for the devs something that android has been missing since the era of tegra
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,sd elite is the best
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,software wise youre not gonna do benchmark all the time especially if the apps that yo more mediatek diminesty and apple are based armva archetecture and both processors do not support bit
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and you think benchmark outweighs software support have yet to see game developers pumping more there just making it ios only because they think that ios is the dominant os
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bro does not know about the that sh smokes the pro in antutu and dmark lmao and you think benchmark outweighs software support have yet to see game developers pumping more games on android especially for the fact that epic games is pushing fornite back on mobile and the only cheapest cut is the ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well the mediatek dimensity is comparable to the pro software wise youre not gonna do benchmark all the time especially if the apps that you wanted is incompatible with the processor
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hahaha one of the reasons iphone will never be better than android phones have an andro more infinix is definitely not better than the iphone except maybe software wise but only because of the stock android features
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone sucks their phone doesnt even let file transfer to computer or connect to wifi downgrad more how do you even connect to the wifi do you even have an iphone in the first place
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,theres inch displays in africa in europe we are still at inch wrong info in europe displays exceed inches in africa they barely exceed inches
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,use daily routine no issue still love apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,create phine without cameras without ip and navigation body type model iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,obviously you can but you should keep at least years then it will be worthy guess dont think can give that much of my earnings because need to save it for something that doesnt lose its value because the price of the tb version has increased now tl the price keeps increasing dont think it makes sense because about five years ago we could buy car that had never been used with this money about ten years ago we could buy twobedroom apartment in newly built building in the city center and if the phone breaks down after you buy itrepair costs are very high
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,trash speaker compare to the pro max its very embarrassing to play music with full volume with this pro max mean only the vocal parts of the song are on normal volume other vise its just capped at crazy how no one talks about this to whoever ever to play their favourite song it will be really fuxked up
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so if want to move from android to iphone and want phone with big screen and high refresh rate this iphone pro max is my only option also need to buy it overseas if want it to have simcard tray because apple is pushing the esim im not sure if really apple wants me to be their customer it doesnt feel like
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,go for ultra pros display quality multi tasking best ai in mobile and last is sams more absolutely if have bucks just cast aside doubts and buy samsung never been sad since model
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,checking the display why would not check the display of my own mobile so you ask in store to turn off the lights then you go and do your experiment lol what about when you are outside are you shutting down the sun to see white pixels lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,though prefer faster charging and nice to have but if you only charge once day and have more it wont matter unless you start playing games or it does when you sometimes forget to charge and in rush
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,not worth it battery fast draining its still better than most other phones around even though by small margin its using an oled which is more energy efficient than amoled and some small optimization apparently its hard to compare with other android phones because most of them have amoled and bigger display closest is sony xperia with smaller display then you see this iphone still has like better battery
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just for your info apple intelligence is now available in europe too aka apple spy intelligence
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,because thats barely noticeable for its prices upgrades should be way bigger beca more though prefer faster charging and nice to have but if you only charge once day and have full day battery life it barely matters im currently using iphone pro max and it gets me whole day through get sot for battery life
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,was iphone pro max so there was plenty minor changes even guys think diferent way cam more because thats barely noticeable for its prices upgrades should be way bigger because there is plenty of room to improve lets start with super slow faster charging lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yes mentioned that adding more to the content now just started using it without screen more just for your info apple intelligence is now available in europe too
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,who cares both companies supplies great oled screens there is difference in between the displays when you put on white screen one part becomes warmer than the other in the displays made by one particular manufacturer
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pretty sure you must at least notice the battery life it is tank yes mentioned that adding more to the content now just started using it without screen protector and it gives good vibes screen protector increases the borders and they gave me no new feel to pm what surprising for me is the raw format improvements while doing post processing in lightroom in pm the color profile is default but in pm it is apple proraw which is giving me more color points and other features like flexible noise reduction points better lens corrections etc am not using my anymore it is giving me almost similar results with more portable factor
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,screen to body ratio yet theres huge selfie pill cutout compared to punch hole more you should be thankfull for lg because they were first to introduce dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,what crazy iphone xs max more expensive then iphone pro max pice yes because thats the first model when apple had to buy displays from samsung
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the only thing can say about this phone is superb in every detail fom xr to ip pm is very satisfying upgrade the battery can last hrs more
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,always wonder whether samsungapple will ever implement the watt and faster charging imp more they will when others will have chargers
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is fairly new especially on iphone you should wait at least years to upgrade if you want more yes nowadays its seems to be better to wait for few years rather than updating every other year
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hi all have few things to share regrading my experience with pm upgraded from pm more pretty sure you must at least notice the battery life it is tank
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,exactly too upgraded from pm to pm doesnt seem to be major change now think its more is fairly new especially on iphone you should wait at least years to upgrade if you want to feel something new
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just upgraded from the iphone pm to the iphone pm doesnt feel that big of an difference the screen resolution is also quite the same how has the battery life experience been of majority of the users here
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,could anyone tell me whether the natural titanium of the iphone pro max is different from the natural titanium of the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still no video recording what kind of monitor orand tv do you have with true native resolution
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well the iphone pro max is no longer available to buy new and will strongly suggest not more not worth the risk in my opinion what risk if it has warranty and far better price for same features
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and you are no different you got easily fooled by the numbers go and touch some grass loser you got easily fooled by the numbers what numbers fooled me will go touch grass under the snow later after you explain bold statements without proof
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple has removed the advanced encryption facility in the uk after bending to government press more dont think of apple customers thinks before buying
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,httpsyoutubebohcgfxwsikttecefccmaow iphone pro max win stainless steel more the durability of the iphone is decreasing hopefully vivo will dominate the majority of the cellphone market so that the iphone and samsung will improve and improve their quality
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dollars brand new amazon bought it is very good gold colour sim free tb storage likelyhood is that may not be genuine pro max since phone that retails for over wouldnt sell for when its only few months old especially the tb model
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this isnt buy bitcoin and buy apple shares
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple iphone start years apple intelligence start now apple irobot start more ai by apple still in the development stage just like harmony next ai by huawei if you want to buy now its not the right time in order ai for the iphone to work optimally at least network is required in mobile market will be at the top of technology will keep using my old iphone until the update ios period is over
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont know who told you that but the battery life will be fine with gaming and it should run more
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thats years away yes thats true also im interested about the iphone fold httpsmgsmarenacomapplesecuresultrathinglasssupplyforitsfirstfoldablescreendevicelaunchingnextyearnewsphp
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,last comment iphone pro max have chipset apple bionic pro ram gbtb new camera up more thats years away
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it depends normal usage wise not much different but when digging deeper for more advance fe more exactly for day to day life one wont notice any difference at all one thing must express here is the battery life of iphone pro max is excellent even with mah battery im getting sot with to cycle count battery health using since sept one can only imagine what apple would do with mah believe battery life of this phone is the best after sony xperia vi of course sot depends on what you doing for gaming sot is not possible
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,quick ultra or pro max dont usually change phones so this gonna last till it dies go the pro max it so good and nice lookin and cheaper than ultra mine is buy fromthe amazon dollars
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,coming from android to iphone since september you will miss the ease of more it depends normal usage wise not much different but when digging deeper for more advance feature will see the different normally dont suggest to fall into the ios trap as it is not as open as android platform yes know there is many workaround way to make it work as flexible as android but still not as flexible open unless one already fond to the ios ecosystem long ago where they have many other apple products then one might find using an iphone will work much more seamlessly with their other apple products coming from both android and ios user
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is this good option for someone who has never used an iphone before and has been an android more go with pro max still good phone to use in with latest ios updates
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,go with pro if you can get it at good price want bigger screen so that means can go with the pro max instead
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple uses gigs of ram and weaker processors because ios is optimized if iphones had an os powered by android they wouldve probably made more powerful chipsets also battery draining slower even if capacity is smaller
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wait did you mean auto correct and it cant be turned off really hate auto corr more if you dont speak nonenglish then auto correct wont be problem but auto suggestions in english while typing too is worse than android but like said you can download swiftkey and enjoy best typing experience
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont worry mate my pro max has mah battery it is gud get gud battry life out of it more if iphone can last day than android can last week lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hello guys want to know real user impression regarding this device in terms of battery more coming from android to iphone since september you will miss the ease of accessing the notification from middle of the screen this can be mitigated by enabling doubletriple tap as well as by minimising the whole screen by dragging down you will hate the keyboard and its auto suggestions suggest swiftkey apart from these you wont notice much difference camera is comparable to android but video apple is the best and it will take some time to get used to ios tricks and settings
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no mp no nit peak brightness no fm radio no buy more mega pixels doesnt mean better camera quality

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,want it hard work with it improvement
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my pm has this screen glitch and even provided them videos of it for justification during my more lol you should buy phone with the best screen from huawei mate series even apple and samsung dont dare to make it because it rarely experiences screen damage there is an advertisement of huawei mate being thrown meters without any scratches and still smooth without cracks
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this brand is the sole reason of why phone prices are high insurance on phone removal more spot onthey are not dominating anythingpeople are just supid and buy them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my new iphone pro max only mah why dont worry mate my pro max has mah battery it is gud get gud battry life out of it can run whole day with it no problem

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ultra more powerful and greatest of the economic technologies keep dreaming
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,kindly suggest good wireless as well as wired charger for pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it is normal to expect that the second generation of nm chipset will be more power efficient more ultra more powerful and greatest of the economic technologies
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone pro max vs iphone pro max didnt see the build quality in any other more yes get same with other company like oppo
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just like to mention something about battery healthi had pro max for whilebattery more it is normal to expect that the second generation of nm chipset will be more power efficient than the first generation the same destiny shall be with snapdragon elite we can expect more power drainage in ultra
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yeah another android fanboy spotted bro the reality is reality iphones give like charging and mah of battery and why is that just to make it look like oh its an expensive phone and can do everything like boil your eggs so it will take time to charge even realme quarter of its price gives charging or samsung galaxy give mah battery now youll may say that the processor is way better but the ultra still gives better processor at less price iphones cant multitask tim cook is not cooking bro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,meh apple intelligence feels so budget when compared to samsung other than the camera pro max and pro max are the same smooth ios though
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,android fanboy oh well didnt see any apple fanboy here since its too low but may find it later bait used to be believable bottom text
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,your iphone is using liion batteries the first commercial phone with lithiumion batte more android fanboy oh well didnt see any apple fanboy here since its too low but may find it later
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the worst problem of iphones are their small battery and super slow charging yeah another android fanboy spotted
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,screen to body thats good ultra has get rid of the ugly pill thing and youll have or more
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,great apple finally caught up with samsungs battery looks at vanilla iphone welp take that back
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,your statement is based on theory not on real usage can you trust xiaomi do you know that more real bro at least use realme in your comparison
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,years of good battery health is really poor want to get phone that can confortably deli more your statement is based on theory not on real usage can you trust xiaomi do you know that when xiaomi announced their first electric mobile they claimed their selfdeveloped full self driving technology is better than than teslas in the end xiaomis emobile crashed caught on fire bumped into innocent pedestrians and so on xiaomi is liar dont believe them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,technically speaking youre not supposed to buy pro max if you have pro max yo more correct
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,comparison of iphone pro max and iphone pro max the iphone pro max and iphone more how many countries outside of asia have wifi hmm almost none so thats just marketing
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this pill can be more slimmer like honor magic pro they have biometrics too but slimmer cutout
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dollars ridiculous yes it was very gud deal for me so nice brandin new to max gold color looking so gud
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the quote matches perfectly when it comes to apple the greatest trick the system ever pulled was convincing people they were winning while being played feel that if tomorrow apple launches phone like old nokia phone and brag that its new trend people will buy that too even if it costs an arm and leg its like the irony of people knowingly participating in something flawed but still feeling triumphant about it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,what has something to do with current battery conversation even batteries used in iphone more hahaha and youre saying apple rules anything at all httpswwwgsmarenacomsonysellsbillionimagesensorsdoublesshipmentsinfiveyearsnewsphp
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this is basically the same phone just bigger and with dumb camera button that is more of more technically speaking youre not supposed to buy pro max if you have pro max youre supposed to buy pro max if you have something like vanilla or pro max or xs max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the terra version in zimbabwe is euros with these money you can buy giraffes on the black market
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,amzng fone buy for dollars about ern it very gud brand new from the amazon website more dollars ridiculous
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,excellent phone yes much agree with my mate
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if you know better the history and significance of and apple wouldnt claim it more what has something to do with current battery conversation even batteries used in iphone was not thing at that time and even phones lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,he said improvement apple has improvement on battery they all can last for more iphone pro max is built to last both am enjoying the iphone never again will go back to the second range of manufacturers recommend to you to stick and buy the phone mentioned deserve it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,also posted numbers speak for themselves sufficient for the smart one he said improvement apple has improvement on battery they all can last for whole day brand new out of the box charging speeds improvements about what improvements are we talking about if its efficient that doesnt change the fact its and old tech battery with super slow charging you can start with lipo which is proved that works great and gives much better charging speeds you shouldnt mention silicon based batteries in apple it will be introduced as new tech after years when other phones will move to even more advanced technologies
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,do you understand that endurance rating has nothing to do with technology inside also posted numbers speak for themselves sufficient for the smart one
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,even though its still almost the same phone as the last year ones this phone is very smooth excellent phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,one detail shouldnt be missed apple batteries by iphone phone models and after are more your iphone is using liion batteries the first commercial phone with lithiumion batteries was the sony ppc released in good improvement what improvement its same battery tech as it was years ago samsung and apple are so far behind in battery tech compared to competition for example oneplus is good sample new battery tech sic more juice in same physical space insanely fast charging thats an improvement
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yes it is it is deliberately slowed down for fully charging battery especially between more one detail shouldnt be missed apple batteries by iphone phone models and after are designed to retain percent of their original capacity at complete charge cycles under ideal conditions good improvement httpssupportapplecomenus
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the issue of my iphone not charging seems to be relatively common problem after noticing that my phone wasnt charging checked whether the charging cable and adapter were working properly as thats often the cause also made sure that the charging port wasnt blocked or dirty since that can also cause issues even when used wireless charger ensured that the phone was placed correctly on the pad it seems that this problem is seen in many iphone users but in most cases it can be fixed with these checks if the issue persists it might need more thorough inspection by technician
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hello bought iphone pro max and power adapter ive been using it for week more yes it is it is deliberately slowed down for fully charging battery especially between and by algorithms to prolong battery life choose in battery customization the option to stop charging battery at it will also protect the battery lot also do not let battery discharge bellow in that way you will have pretty decent time for battery charging between and and have long battery health for years in to range the daily battery endurance will be more than good and battery will last longer
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thats very unconvincing should hold it in hands to see it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the great of the best thats very unconvincing
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thing if apple dont have another product it will be like blackberry they are selling brand only not features

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yes indeed its sharp jsh thats first digital camera phone yes but not the first two stage shutter button on modern phones you seem to misunderstand everything and bring random stuff into conversation from simple research sony ericsson satio released first with dedicated button like cameras predating that also first dedicated lens slider worlds first mobile phone with highresolution autofocus camera on sony ericsson ki so you see sony innovated lot even in those early days which only proves that your hate for that brand is immature
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no not wrong yes indeed its sharp jsh
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wrong nokia lumia no not wrong
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,shutter button is obviously sony wrong nokia lumia
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,even though the idea is copied from sony or from old phones in but the imp more shutter button is obviously sony
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this is what gives me impression that you dont even know what you talking about just more oh yes but do not try to convince people of things they dont know apple knows how to take advantage of the fact that they dont know thats better and more sad take on life
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,sony has dedicated camera button for years now they also have fingerprint sensor on power but more even though the idea is copied from sony or from old phones in but the implementation of touch button is indeed an innovation itself indeed its not sony innovation btw doubt its logical to mention sony in far better device forum its just spam
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,funny how apple is promoting their new button like its the invention of the century mean more sony has dedicated camera button for years now they also have fingerprint sensor on power button that implementation is far better than camera launch using power button the whole point of camera shutter is to make it feel like holding camera hence the bottom right we all should appreciate that apple turned this boring sonys shutter button into in capacitive touch shutter button even though the idea is copied from sony or from old phones in but the implementation of touch button is indeed an innovation itself
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,highly doubt that because regular people cant find difference and thats fact more you dont need doubts my name is not scam number one
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gave and tested people using spectacles or eye sight couldnt tell the difference but more highly doubt that because regular people cant find difference and thats fact doubt in such short time you managed to show anything to anybody doubt you have many friends because for example you spend more time here than with your family lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,neither yours your audacity to call not noticeable to fhd on smartphone is laughable pr more think its other way around its not worth the money
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post neither yours your audacity to call not noticeable to fhd on smartphone is laughable probably less noticeable but still noticeable is what you cant accept because you cant afford it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,do test yourself give your friends same phone with display and then with full hd guar more gave and tested people using spectacles or eye sight couldnt tell the difference but normal eye sight people able to tell the difference it turns out it is not placebo effect like hz and hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,samsung display modes are as saturated as your eyes being not able to distinguish fhd and more do test yourself give your friends same phone with display and then with full hd guarantee you they wouldnt feel difference and make this test fair and dont say anything best test is not placebo effect keep living in your dreams
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if you dont like colors that doesnt mean screen is bad that means they cali more samsung display modes are as saturated as your eyes being not able to distinguish fhd and on smartphone hehehe samsung calibration engineers have same taste like yours apeape together strong if you see high numbers that automatically mean you have better hardware whether one can seeutilize it or not depends on the eye sight guess your doctor also studied the same university scam university like you if you have perfect vision you would have noticed the difference
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,samsung screen pic colours are worst oversaturated have ever seen if you like them buy th more and btw ive been to doctor because needed my driving license resumed and in my country its mandatory to take an eye test and guess what no issues perfect vision maybe you need to visit doctor for some kind of autism symptoms or paranoia because you are seeing non existing things which is normal if you are sick
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,first thing most flagship phones uses at least fhd second thing you cant see differe more samsung screen pic colours are worst oversaturated have ever seen if you like them buy them dont tell me what also have to eat everyday haha you are the one with bad eye sight here scam number one kqhd screens on phones are lot better than fhd screens and qhd videos playing on those screens will prove that if only you have money to buy high resolution smartphone you would know with your love for fhd screens you will also buy fhd screen for highly suggest you first take eye doctor appointment before commenting on gsmarena and is too late
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,listen scam number one im currently using iphone pro max coming from sony ii one more first thing most flagship phones uses at least fhd second thing you cant see difference on such tiny screen and thats fact if you dont like colors that doesnt mean screen is bad that means they calibrated differently you should have gotten samsung and went with amoled photo setting somehow you managed to find gsmarena forum to cr you should have invested more time about all fragships available before buying whats not for you
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,how about hybrid device running both ios and ipad os with screen size between to cater for both users of iphone and ipad
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post listen scam number one im currently using iphone pro max coming from sony ii one reason to give up vi is the resolution to my eyes and in my opinion on phones is better than crappy inferior screens if you willing to shell over for fhd be an ignorantdoof and go ahead no one is stopping you
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,proof that nobody can even begin to argue against the facts we are all soon going to be reduc more you can instantly tell whether you are playing resolution video and video on your phone itself try playing netflix content of both highly doubt your eyesight cant tell the difference let alone on tv screens ok lets say is enough for people like you then buy low end smartphone which comes at lower price and lower spec hardware lower camera because thats going to be enough leave the people who want more from their smartphone and who spend over no one in right mind buys low end specs over period maybe for you sony xperia series is enough in terms of flagship
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,most users have unlimited wifi at home unless they are living in third world country where mos more proof that nobody can even begin to argue against the facts we are all soon going to be reduced to what you call thirdworld status by the folk you voted for the most recently so using hd screens makes sense on any smartphone it is impossible to see the difference when buying tv try seeing if you can detect the difference in resolution between hd and resolution on tv screen of less than diagonal size you cant at the normal viewing distance and we tested this instore with young customers with perfect eyesight decade ago so phone screen who are you kidding there is just no advantage to higher than hd use on smartphone the exception being ogling your photos by enlarging sections to see if they are sharp but certainly not video or gaming
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,screen density the greater the number of pixels on your screen when you are online the quic more most users have unlimited wifi at home unless they are living in third world country where most users just use mobile data or limited wifi plans and people who buy will definitely and can definitely afford the unlimited data you can have at different speeds so your point about data is meaningless for flagship phone users maybe makes sense for low end phones screen resolution on flagship phones is important one factor for differentiating low and high end smartphones on inches is not flagship hardware where your high end cameras can record or even videosi mean whats the point of recording videos if you cant differentiate between and on such screns then you better get cameras which are midtier or low tier hardware either you go full high end hardware or you dont thats the difference between low and top flagships after all and as screen user for years definitely can say screen is lot better than on smartphone only reason sony being the only mobile producer havent gone hz is snapdragon chips still even elite version cant support screens hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,innovation nice new action button that can take pictures great better camera that better take zoom fantastic
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gsm arena today lists pro max with gb storage at over when believed them to more there is no gb variant
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,baby the iphone pro max got new button do not forget promise to bring something new in the futureai lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just proved you that sony did not reduce their prices and selling fhd screen at same price more lower resolution ltpo lm smoother interaction even better haptic feel but im not trying to convince you to buy new xperia do not believe you would actually learn to appreciate it am glad you bought an iphone believe you should stick to that decision it defines your horizon
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,current prices in romania the largest retailer know xperia vi gb ron more just proved you that sony did not reduce their prices and selling fhd screen at same price this year so you bring other phone to convince me that should pay for lower screen even though have gotten screen at same price last year what kind of non sense is this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,current prices of sony smartphones overpriced
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no esim in us model and maybe some bands mean physical sim card pardon
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,launch prices xperia ii with screen gb xperia iii with screen more current prices in romania the largest retailer know xperia vi gb ron euros iphone max pro gb ron euros and of course you can always add tb on the sd card on the xperia you cant see beyond ppi xperia vi has ppi xperia iv all have ppi iphone pro max has ppi so what did you see better on your xperia iv than you see on your iphone of course you didnt you can rant about physical realities such as the limits of human vision but you cant change them as for the prices they speak for themselves they are both expensive phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,they have as already explained launch prices xperia ii with screen gb xperia iii with screen gb xperia iv with screen gb last year with screen gb this year vi with fhd screen gb gb dont argue with sale prices or discounts or current prices dont compare with other brands as well just convince me how screen is worth same price as fhd
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so accordingly they should also reduce the price my point they have as already explained
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my point exaclty is not suitable for this is why salute sonys decision to use more so accordingly they should also reduce the price my point
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is completely useless on such tiny screens sony is overpriced end of story stop spamming my point exaclty is not suitable for this is why salute sonys decision to use an fhd panel for the xperia vi
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,did not say completely useless dont hold my phone in front of my eyes more is completely useless on such tiny screens sony is overpriced end of story stop spamming
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,can fully use an iphone pro max from us in romania europe what do need to be aware more no issue just bought an iphone pro max from ny city few days ago and use it in romania without any issue all our major operators offer esim now
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it is limited is fact but not completely useless is also fact cm is what any human more did not say completely useless dont hold my phone in front of my eyes while sleeping you cant see the pixels thats why did the math for you considering the difference between screen sizes yes you can press it once but it is not true twostep shutter button the second step is capacitive theres where the gimmick lies your argument concerning the price does not stand considering the resolution as already and twice explained the fact is that both the iphone pro max and sony xperia vi have exceptional screens nobodys questioning that they have both gone beyond human perception in terms of resolution which is good enough and yes that saves battery life you are completely right professional cameras for professional photos then the whole marketing discourse about professionalexceptionalastounding photos taken with any iphone samsung sony vivo or any other device remains fake marketing strategy now once you take that out of the equation and you easily notice natural photos taken with the vi vs unnatural photos taken with the iphone the pixel let alone samsung they youre starting to understand where the difference lies yup youre right in well lit scenarios the telephoto is better on the vi but this comes at the cost of having them slightly overexposed in other scenarios my point sony is not different from the others and when they try to increase the quality with software tweaks the results are equally mixed dont believe this is the best camera on phone at this moment pura is better some other chinese models offer competitive cameras too ultra had its chance but they keep on processing the photos so the general feel is still not there they do it consciously there are more consumers out there interested in that fake feel than consumers who are not seamless zoom lol from to the zoom is optical on the xperia it too notice the shift from one lens to another if you dont notice it on the iphone is because they compensate on the sowtware level so that you perceive the shift seamless but it is not seamless the lenses do switch so again basic optics if you would take photo at that very moment when lenses shift it would be logically unsusable haha this is fun was thinking how we need to actually change the lenses on our professional cameras if we want completely different focal lenght so that type of magic is not for me but you can go on and live with the illusion that the lens transition is seamless close your left eye now open your right eye as fast as you can while closing the left eye can you do this seamlessly lol you probably do given the fact that you see beyond ppi at inches only had one phone with notch lite back in the day used it for two years and wasnt able to adjust my perception to that notch however interesting talk could not have imagined years ago to have such talk about such advanced technology these companies evolved faster than expected and you got me wrong believe the iphone pro max is an exceptional device but also believe xperia vi is better overall ps check for prices for iphones too on other local markets there happen to be deals better than those mentioned in our dialogue
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,smithravi true the initial argument was that the amount of time when sony phones di more it is limited is fact but not completely useless is also fact cm is what any human can hold while sleeping please take measuring scale and measure the distance also inches is what iphone screen size and not inches it is indeed massive phone and not small device do see pixels if you put your eyes closure and for some humans like me do notice the quality overall again dont force this on all you are right in explaining the definitions but wrong in understanding and how it works apples cameral control button is physical button just google it is both if you cant seem to perceive how then cant spoon feed you anymore price matters and in the end is big deal sony should not even think about releasing an fhd phone at competitors prices who are gving qhd which is also expensive in this sense sony is more expensive for what it offers than others resolution is one aspect of that no body wants to buy mediocre screen when you can get qhd for same price unless he is imbesil if want to take professional photo will take it by professional photographer even if you give high end camera to normal user wont able to click proper pics so your argument is valid only for niche usersphotographers as for the camera yes sony excels in some scenarios especial in well lit conditions even their technology for telephoto is different and appreciate it but results matter except in few scenarios all photos taken in telephoto and low light were bad and definitely not worthyuseful at price just do lens transition on sony and come back to me no other smartphone other than iphone can do excellent lens transition it keeps the same colours contrast and you dont even notice that you are recording on different lenses seamless zoom this you cant say for sony even though they have better bt more and more hdr is also something sony is poor it is not reliable compared to iphones yes do like uninterrupted screen watch lot of content and play games it is indeed annoying but thats the price pay for the rest of the benefits like if have picked sony would have paid the price in screen resolution shortcuts automations all round pictures reliable features and long software support etc must also add kind of liked dynamic island features loved shortcuts automation imagine you can tell what your phone needs to do without touching your phone and based on location connection and what not with this im ending my arguments and take that you only wants to see your perspective rather than others
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it is expensive indeed but all the other flagships on the market right now are utterly so right now other flagships offers way more features way longer software support and global availability its absurd to mention sony along side google samsung and apple think in near future even vivo will surpass it easily
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no dont like to read spam sony is overpriced end of topic it is expensive indeed but all the other flagships on the market right now are utterly so
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,have you read the comments you are off topic no dont like to read spam sony is overpriced end of topic
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it doesnt work on your account doesnt mean it doesnt work for all of us more smithravi true the initial argument was that the amount of time when sony phones display content is extremely limited and its not an argument its fact ive tried to place my xperia vi at cm apart from not seeing the actual pixels felt odd of course nobody is using their phones at that distance the minimal distance recommended for lcd and oled screens is three times the diagonal of the screen in sonys case that is cm in pro maxs case that is all right lets lower this to but why not simply stick your eyeball to the display itself and dont particularly entertain the idea of using my phone in the context you mention no am not wrong capacitive pertaining to capacitance the button has sensors that feel the amount of pressure your finger exerts on them and acts accordingly that is ellectrically not mechanically yup im sorry in germany the prices are higher but youre still in the same ppi discourse and ive already explained the realities of the ppi density which is the threshold and what are the limits of human vision true prefer to edit pictures that ive taken and consider especially good but most of the pictures take with my phone stay unedited my argument there was that consumers have somehow developed the idea that smartphone can take professional photos no smartphone can do that its basic optics it is and repeat myself amazing what these companies have done given the small sizes of the lenses as for the camera yup too believe telephoto is better managed on the iphone it is again because of the artefact sony is stuck with the idea that the natural look should rule but they havent managed to master the tele as they have the wide and the macro low light you just have to use the pro settings and youll get approximately similar results with sony however believe low light is utterly bad on all the smartphones right now and we wont see major improvements in the following years again basic optics videos use the pro settings in sony sony is currently using bt which translates to cdm eotf hdr then take video shot with iphone play it on display and enjoy the following slight color fringing color abberation overly saturated colors in bright environments and the lovely just lovely superimposed contrast that hurts my eyes macro straight out of the bat the difference is huge regret not being able to add few macro photos taken with my xperia telemacro this is where the limits of dof become obvious sony is the only manufacturer except for huawei pura to offer this as far as know the results are mixed believe huawei has done better job here but were talking literally heads of insects here the other phones cant even get decent focus at that distance the general feel of the images im sure you know what im talking about they are beautifully natural so different from what could get on samsung or pixel or this iphone for that matter ok must get back to work now but im still puzzled how you could get accustomed with the display given that horrid cutout you know very well how nice an uninterruped display is and lacking frontfacing speakers for me as far as multimedia content is concerned these two are essentials
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it doesnt work on my youtube account however the use of the on sony phones is more it doesnt work on your account doesnt mean it doesnt work for all of us maybe you also stick your phone at arms length when you use your phone in bed or while sitting on toi im among many who uses phone lot shorter than cm depending on the position mechanical capacitive is improper in itself you are wrong capacitive is for just scrolling and mechanical button is for the focus half click and capture click like said you should check the reviews properly next time use this official link httpswwwsonydestoreproductxqeceukcggcxperiacavicneuesteleobjektivccatageakkulaufzeitchelleresdisplaypoweredbybraviaea can only speak for the prices in germany gb version of sony vi fhd at and iphone pro max at yes both are expensive as so all smartphones but fhd screen for is sand in your eyes not everyone wants to edit their pictures maybe personally never edit and just use pics taken directly maybe you have different use case and personal preference maybe you should not force your preferences on others for my use case iphone does satisfy just like sony did to be honest low light photography and telephoto iphone did better than sony comparatively straight off the bat videos dont you even argue just go and check the youtube videos or reviews check the video samples and then come back to me
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,guys its one of the most popular phones in the world forum along side samsung think more have you read the comments you are off topic
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,few things to correct you dont need to enable on youtube each time by defaul more it doesnt work on my youtube account however the use of the on sony phones is super limited as already stated the human eye cant perceive more than ppi in panels stating otherwise would be equally informed as stating that the world is flat and dont keep the panel cm from your eyes it hurts your eyes happen to get my vision checked once year as work as parttime image editor mechanical capacitive is improper in itself the role of capacitive button is to mimic the behaviour of mechanical button but like the idea of integrating the zoom in the button though on the other side capacitive button loses the feel of taking photo its so much less natural ive doublechecked the price that particular store doesnt list the xperia vi any more im based in romania you can check dont believe im allowed to drop links here on the major romanian retailers as we speak its around in other stores but know germany the netherlands and the uk up the smarphone prices every now and then the price discussion is irrelevant all the smarphones included in this discussion are expensive am sure you can confirm ill pass this information to my wife shes the main editor in our household the number of jobs she has already refused from iphone users her monitor is professional color calibrated etc mine is simple inch panel is fun it goes like this need someone to take my photo and make it look exceptional ok send the photo there you go and then my wife opens the photo in photoshop and starts swearing iphone pic again all these devices be it sony apple oppo and what not are designed to display nice photos on their displays the quantity of artefact in both say samsung and apple is simply ridiculous you cant process decent result even after miles of tweaking in lightroom they are striving to make the pics look better given the size of the lenses and theyve done wonders but they are still lowconsumer wonders im still puzzled why do most of the consumers prefer those fakelooking images with bumpedup colors contrast and sharpness whereas my nikon mm lenses tell different story
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,we should structure this dialogue inch display renders approximately more few things to correct you dont need to enable on youtube each time by default it is at qhd and once you choose never needed to change now im doubting your use case maybe change settings in your youtube account also human eye cant perceive more than ppi is bs it depends on lot of factors for example the distance youre looking at your phone can see pixels with fhd screen at cmand lower so your argument is invalid here also the pictures and videos you take are useless unless you have screen your poor eyes cant notice any difference so maybe everyone should stop recording videos samsung should even dump the because who has tvs and monitors haha also there are few other apps which supported recently on mobile devices guess amazon prime is one of them which played uhd trust me and even apple said it it is two in one button physicalmechanical plus capacitive it was proved and quoted by lot of reviewers too so yes its more than just mechanical shutter button but it is still button price just google and go to sony germany select your device and check for handlers youll see for xperia vi base price with gb dont know how you bought it cheaper maybe you live in britain even their newly launched scarlet red vi is at though its gb have seen with my own eyes can confirm that videos on iphone are lot better than any android period
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no expect at least qhd for where sony failed comes at the cost of hz so yes more we should structure this dialogue inch display renders approximately ppi you cannot miss what you cannot see when apple patented the retina display they missed the mark with approximately ppi back then ppi was what they called norm however the maximum ppi the human eye can perceive is around your eyes are unable to spot pixels from display they are simply too small do you understand that and then it comes the fun fact that you were actually looking at fhd content the only instances where sony xperia and the previous models render the content in are very specific youtube videos you have to enable it in settings each and every time otherwise even youtube will play fhd native videos im sure youve shot hundreads and few other very specific apps you actually did not use display do you understand that back in the day compared my xperia ii with my brothers xperia ii played the same video on both noone in the room was able to tell absolutely any difference between the two panels they were identical in rendering though the iis was tad smaller iphone button you are correct my miss though its capacitive not mechanical ive just searched it lol they market the existence of the button as they own invention yet again they invent something that has been around for years aspect ratio agree too believe it was move to appease new potential fans and miss the aspect ratio everybody hated somehow ive got accustomed to this one and enjoy the fact that most of the movies on streaming services fit better for regular portrait browsing and sony movies though the was impeccable sony can see you appreciate this brand actually thats why im taking the time to answer to your comment too had for couple of years lovely phone but im slightly puzzled about the price you keep on mentioning im located in the eu bought my phone for exactly euros which is still expensive imho and you can easily go for even less and add more storage space on the sd card should you need it cameras of course they are closer its the same sony sensor on both devices apart from software with video content though tend to disagree once you try to process iphone videos you get to see the quantity of artefact however theyve improved lot in my oppinion any iphone camera before rendered very poor photos on the other side for good videos with the xperia vi you need to use the pro mode agree try shooting in raw and youll understand my point
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,know sony was the only manufacturer to give screens on smartphones have more depends on user experience
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so you expect from sony and lower resolution from the other companies that sounds almost more no expect at least qhd for where sony failed comes at the cost of hz so yes expect sony to provide while others qhd at hz do some research iphone has two buttons now one for power button and other dedicated camera control which acts as shutter button obviously you are frog in well after using both sony and iphone resolution is what im missing in iphone you keep on use that fhd but at man get out of here with your fhd im not spending that much for fhd they went back on aspect ratio and fhd to appease other fans obviously fhd for hz even though they can also do it with screen who knows whats next you can check my old comments here on gsmarena go to sony xperia ii and comment section and come back have advocated for sony for so long but now at this price range sony is giving me less compared to others of course any smartphone requires compromises just find for my use case iphone better cameras on iphone are lot closer to sony than samsung or pixel again have used both videos you cant even argue iphone is the best
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,please enlighten me what company offers twostep mechanical dedicated shutter button exc more nokia lumia excellent find you must have done your research did you know that kodak jiffy ii was released in that too had shutter button
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no read them quite carefully no more this is fun sony was and is th more know sony was the only manufacturer to give screens on smartphones have used phones with that screens and loved them but dont agree that they downgraded the resolution to show off the world the main reason is qualcomm chips cant do hz even today with elite still they could have given us options to toggle the resolution at that price tag that is the problem want from sony or at least qhd like competitors at this price range not fhd from this year iphone also has dedicated shutter button with extra added features like controlling zoom exposure etc so no sony is not the only company anymore they missed the opportunity to do something innovative like apple did on this button it is expensive phone because you can get higher resolution superb contrast and excellent colour range at higher resolution on competitors devices my iphone display has all things you said at higher ppi for same cost as vi like said have used two screens and know what im talking ppi matters on such large phones also sony not only went back on resolution they also went back on aspect ratio whats next micro sd card audio jack you see where its going that is the reason went to iphones also what about software support all companies now giving at least years support myself used my last phone over years for this price gb expect at least years support that is one more reason for me to switch
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,consideted gsmarena reviews as reference to buy new smartphone until now your review over the speakers iphone pro max was fake and full of missinformation so you said that has the same speaker system like iphone pro max your expert is not aware about top and bottom speakers are now better aligned to produce balanced sound and apple has upgraded the audio hardware including more advanced amplifiers and speakers that offer broader range of frequencies also has used new materials to construct the speaker components its clear gsmarena lost his credibility and prestige in smartphone world
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple sales drop since last year in south east asia
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,guess you forgot to read properly this following sentences but now the reasons have more no read them quite carefully no more this is fun sony was and is the only manufacturer to bring inch display that is an overkill believe they just wanted to show the world that they can switching back to regular resolution is wellcome shutter button please enlighten me what company offers twostep mechanical dedicated shutter button except for sony price range yes youre right its an expensive phone and ive written extensively about this but your idea to question xperia vi for its display is unintuitive superb contrast excellent color range adjustable for that matter uninterrupted inch display no dynamic island punch holes or other similar nonsensical solutions excellent brightness in sunlight so yes believe you either havent used sony xperia vi or youre simply lacking analytical skills
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont actually understand what youre saying your comment is all in favor for xpe more guess you forgot to read properly this following sentences but now the reasons have been going down for example no more now other company also providing shutter button in addition to capacitive touch control etc unfortunately that fhd screen is big turn off for me at price range as well as my disappointment with the price of sony xperia vi
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nice unfortunately that fhd screen is big turn off for me at price range if only the more dont actually understand what youre saying your comment is all in favor for xperia vi then you choose apple go for it you deserve it or at least the money you make for the comment
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,love how companies now days are willing to sell you fish in the sea aka apple inelegance more love how companies now days are willing to sell you fish in the sea aka apple inelegance and releasing half baked stuff to hopefully fix it in the future what fix there is nothing to fix because its not even out now basically iphone pro max is bucks promise to introduce something new in iphone lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,also bought it on launch day and had many issues typing issues mostlly but those things are now fixed so the phone is coming to its own good battery but the softwrae need to optimize more because there is bit battery drain in standby mode other than that and typing issues had great phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the warranty is year and there is free exchange for the same new iphone people have exper more bought it during launch period and havent faced any hardware problems until now so far hardware is great
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,got this beast from the iphone midnight launch event here in the philippines could have res more only if you use it without any cases doubt anyone who spends hefty price would use without any case and screen protectors except few youtubers and rich rest use with cases
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hahaha are you seriously forbidding people to not care about advice and more decent phones com more highly doubt anyone who spends over care about buying china phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,what is why are you confused you still dont understand
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,decent machine what is
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yes thats what am doing am forbidding people from doing stuff more decent machine
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,okay idk what people are rambling on about this phone its genuinely amazing know im biased as upgraded from an xr but still the battery always gets me through the day even when its only charged to the cameras are amazing and the increase in selfie shots is incredible its also the little things like the incredibly thin but completely even bezels the mp ultra wide camera and even just being able to use for the first time if youve been holding off while now is the time to upgrade unless you know you can wait another year but it is so worth it for any of the this year know people get annoyed at the base models only having hz displays but the average consumer doesnt know and doesnt care its only the pro users complaining about the base models because they are used to hz and get it my xr had hz display and as soon as got the pro max it was instantly smoother but in my years with the xr never once complained about having hz display plus it was an lcd because didnt know what hz felt like the have bright contrasting oled displays that are beautiful to look at if you ever get the chance anyway this is an amazing phone and fully recommend upgrading if you want
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im not normally inclined to give advice do have two pointers for your question though more hahaha are you seriously forbidding people to not care about advice and more decent phones coming you challenge me okay ill give you the best advice next year better not to buy iphone pro max or samsung ultra because between january and march oppo ultra will be launched with an color os very similar to ios and added action button feature and rumor has it that antutu has reached prices start from
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,preorder started on the th of october here in the philippines globe launch event will be on the th preordered the desert titanium see you guys in the launch event lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no it means you owned other android flapships users of the same year nothing beats iphone more lmao this kid is heavily ill
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,at this rate we have to wait for iphone pro maxahahahaha the main issue with pricing is that first world citizens who are already wealthy per third world standards live in credit system and can have it for segmented price of the total cost on monthly payments while third world citizens who make tiny income must pay for the full amount at once creating tech discovery and consumption gap to enjoy life without barriers third world citizens must be careful to where they give birth unless they dont want the kids to enjoy life
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this would be the best phone if there was no software issues and touch screen issues wich are suposed to be fixed with but they are not
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,rog and red magic entered the chat those are definitely not for photography also it doesnt matter if an rog phone is more powerful or an iphone both suck when it comes to gaming because of the inch screen and the lack of actually good mobile games except for stuff like genshin impact
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just realized how big the screen is nice
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,but does owning an iphone means you own apple stock no it means you owned other android flapships users of the same year nothing beats iphones in terms of single app performance photography social apps mobile gaming on top of that those that just get base models for bragging rights
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,usb is not heavyduty plug yes because of the measurement
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,httpswwwapplecomidnewsroomappledebutsiphoneproiphonepromax sam more oh my apologies if that came across wrong its just these two have more money to push marketing otherwise both are terrible in different ways
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,jack usb port usb is not heavyduty plug
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,higher ram gets diminishing returns vs and you barely see the difference would already more this information has been known the world over since the time of microsoft windows xp professional edition this is important and worth knowing only if we already know that there is no windows os or even apple os that actually makes use of the whole of the resources of the cpu if we look in the performance monitor of windows we will see that only portion of the available ram is used at any given time linux os on the other hand can use much of the resource of cpu and also of ram this but then the drawback is that linux is not the choice of os for day to day computer users microsoft has seen to it that they make people addicted to ease of use
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still hz mah battery cant record video with fps quality really too pro max have hz why do you need fps when all you can buy is from gb up to tb it will finish your storage in days
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well lets not get ahead of ourselves theres huge difference between gb and more higher ram gets diminishing returns vs and you barely see the difference would already tell you why if you only run app per time ram on ios is enough and thats how apple specs their cpu gpu high burst large cache see their single core scores its higher then androids only when ipad start using stage managers they start reaching the limit fan would give you better performance then gb can in these small form factor overheating nuggets
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its the screen ratio that makes this comically smaller phone compared to the enormous more no duh its smaller than cheaper phones from to years ago but comically smaller hell no its got inch display and theres no getting around that its huge phone and the dimensions show it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,tbh dont think were going to see such major and drastic change in design with more looking at the test of gb iphone vs gb zte nubia still wins zte nubia
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,see in your sensor options you write compass but when am look iphone website doesnt have compass
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone pro max gb ram scroes higher benchmarks than gb android phones flase gb is slow on iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post the only reason think of when getting an iphone or buying in the ecosystem if ever do is the resell value on the used market even though am against selling used phones for privacy reasons and maybe the camera software not the camera hardware cuz apple knows how to optimize their stuff other than that any midtohighend android have the exact or better screens design and features
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,jesus christ inch display this phone is enormous back in the day the xiaomi mi more its the screen ratio that makes this comically smaller phone compared to the enormous galaxy mega series of phones those are mammoths among smartphones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,make it yourself if you can iphone is neverending glory phone iphone innovation is the bes more iphone innovation is the best maybe it was until steve jobs was alive after that samsung is far superior on innovation section im not even talking about huawei they were excellent that even us decided to ban google for them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,cptpower jun too small this should be size of regular iphone pro should be at least to plus more make it yourself if you can iphone is neverending glory phone iphone innovation is the best first but to be honest if only google pixel started at the same time as iphone would prefer google pixel which is definitely better quality now luckily saved this money to buy google pixel pro xl which is more worth it because the hardware will work together tensor with tsmc nm goodbye iphone and samsung
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,most worthless smartphone in the world iphone and have usb type gen but can more nonsense
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,space and power requirement is very important in phone rather have more cache than ram more doubt you understood what you wrote
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no official review
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,when can we expect complete overhaul of the design of the iphone comparable from iphone more iphone pro max gb ram scroes higher benchmarks than gb android phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,true im italian and prices are insane infact it might stay on the shelves for me
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,never trust motorola and apple again after pager explodebest way will buy china phones better and safe
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bruh was also talking about the product price not just tax alone product prices not incl more it costs usd in india for tb
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,like big displays but whats the use when you cant even have split screen cmon more am using ip pm and am sure it can last up to years instead of replacing the iphone every year iphone ultra more worth for your money
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why give this hz others should have it lol couldnt use
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why why would anyone get this there isnt much of reason at this point
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this is by far great update and am comming from many devices including ultra he wa more the iphone pm is worthy next year the iphone pro max will have more worthy tsmc nm chipset buy it buy it again thats what is called an iphone fanatic
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and which lipo when did you used and for how long which li ion powered phone did you use and more lipo galaxy galaxy xiaomi redmi note pro used each for year and for liion galaxy edge ultra for years and at the year mark the degradation was similar buzz off with your made up words
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ive tried phones with liion and lipoly both both depleted in roughly the same rate more and which lipo when did you used and for how long which li ion powered phone did you use and for how long
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,real or madrid iphone or samsung infinix watt min realme gt watt min realme more its not good battery comparison between chinese phones and samsungapple samsung and apple uses liion batteries and chinese for example lipo long story short difference between them in summary if you are looking for the highest voltage under loadpunch or top speed then choose lipo if you are looking for the highest capacity for the weightenergy density choose liion if safety is big concern then choose liion in other words they are using different technologies li on cant be charged so fast but it will last longer than lipo
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,people dont always understand fast charging the initial phase is fast charge then it more real or madrid iphone or samsung infinix watt min realme gt watt min realme gt watt min claim year software update
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its use charge fast as galaxy ultra agreed
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,aware that iphone with slower charging is saving battery for the phone to last longer people dont always understand fast charging the initial phase is fast charge then it slows down exponentially to keep the battery healthy the phone isnt being blasted with fast charging the whole time
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone variants are exaggeratedlittle innovations with big campaigns
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,when you closed open icloud on the web you cant reopen it no anyone found it at apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,have experienced random ghost touch on my iphone pro max felt like apple is just asking me to upgrade lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,again the tax goes to the gov apple keep none of the tax including vat so whats the more bruh was also talking about the product price not just tax alone product prices not including tax in europe are expensive compared to product price in us for example without tax apple iphone pro max tb costs about in us and it is about same in europe but in reality is not which means apple earns more profits from non us countries
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apples fault is considering read my comment again again the tax goes to the gov apple keep none of the tax including vat so whats the issue shouldnt you raise it to your gov
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,tax goes to gov do not know why complain like thats apples fault apples fault is considering read my comment again
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,in philippines max pro tb is around compare to us price that is the pricing increase is insane in goverment tax
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,haha true but lets be real now days all flagships are costing over whether it more true true but only one thing you can order oneplus gb for euros here in europe and china thats probably the best deal for flagship right now
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the prices are higher even for european market out of is just tax wish apple more true im italian and prices are insane
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this price is still reasonable the problem is that outside europe and china the charges are more the prices are higher even for european market out of is just tax wish apple brings us price into global price at least for product pricing excluding tax at the moment they are considering
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,rcs not working
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post crying in the corner with pro max tb
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,only gb ram periscope telephoto only mp selfie camera only mp sensor type and size left the chat
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the price is still very cheap in america if buy it in indonesia it can reach more in us it is even cheaper you barely touch including tax in some states for tb version in europe the same costs which is ridiculously expensive for each storage options for base gb
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,exactly but holy smokes iphone pro max with tb that costs you could bu more haha true but lets be real now days all flagships are costing over whether it is samsung tb apple tb sony gb can add tb sd card which costs again over pixel tb or even chinese smartphones like huawei costs almost for gb and oneplus even laptops now days costing around with decent oled screen and chip gone are the days barrier now companies became greed inflations is smaller and approaching slowly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,have set this comment to be deleted within days make sure you read it before it is deleted
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if you believe in my best advice you will get the wish you have always dream have been her more oh yes one more important thing found information leaked from the hidden community and after this dont tell anyone iphone implements changes every years the real iphone upgrade is once every years so during these years there have only been small upgrades trust me remember iphone plus plus iphone pm pm so if you want big upgrade wait for the iphone pro max buy it at launch or buy used years ago with discount from new price
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,they are crazy to ask that price for this phone im sorry but even if you upgrade from more have experience with all brands of mobile phones for more than years give you the best alternative options to have the best of the best flagship phones iphone pro max still worth buying and lasts up to years instead of buying this expensive iphone pro max its better to buy one with higher performance is zte nubia red magic pro plus with gb ram snapdragon gen instead of buying an expensive ai camera with very too ordinary buy premium ai camera combined with action button this phone is oppo find ultra which is better than samsung ultra rather than buying triple fold or flip phone it is better to have screens that have been tested for durability namely vivo fold pro with sd gen if you are worried about damage scratches cracks due to impact and fall from your grasp put aside all your favorite phones just focus on one phone with shock resistance the best durability phone no the name is honor magic pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im use ip plus just now what ill should be upgrade to pro or pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,does the kfps works across entire optical zoom range and with all lenses
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont think last year was different aswell the difference of upgrading only feelable when more honestly dont know who in right mind would update every year or once in years these kk devices are supposed to be lasting over years otherwise year os updates mean nothing to anyone myself upgrading from sony xperia ii which is and half years older to iphone pro max with tb that costs my xperia ii with sd still runs all apps without any struggle only complain is the battery life
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,here we go again skip going to iphone pro max with mah
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,doubt pixel pro xl which costs the same is better apple does offer some really nice video more apple is much better than google pixel pixel need to hardwork more years to be on par with apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone mah up percent iphone plus mah up percent ipho more iphone pro max confirmed to release mah for the first time got the leak directly from apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,enhanced is what they want to call it httpsrcommunitysamsungcomtranslat more what is this for
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no it isnt no one can beat apple they are the best and excel at everything you name it more you quite literally named the worst possible competitor and apple is definitely not the best no company makes perfect phones right now honestly so we cant choose which is the best out of which
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,unbelievable all falling for this iphone again what is the point of all these features when it only works in cold climate as phone cant stand the heat its like buying air conditioner which cools only when temperature is normal no doubt phone is very good so is the ios and all its features are top notch daily use but no multiviewing many apps at once no dual apps all paid apps and the worst is the icloud sync gb and even if you pay and get more storage its so damn slow
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,does not satisfy ram only gb only wslow charging then high price
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the new camera button seems to be totally useless
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,those moon shots were fake enhanced is what they want to call it httpsrcommunitysamsungcomtranslategoogtcamcyclopediabapxtrslautoxtrtlenxtrhlengb
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my pro max still charges to all the time and have charging limit set to worked fine on my pro anyone else with this problem it must be software bug
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,how come pro has less capacity than plus plus is bigger in size
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and the edge pro beats hz refresh rate with hz refresh rate and also comparing old but good phone to very good and newer phone is like comparing hydrogen bomb to coughing baby
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,please update already the battery specs of your iphone series the pro max has mah more how come pro has less capacity than plus
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,your delusional samsung phones have been ahead of apple iphone since the start first big more those moon shots were fake
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,biggg and goooood like mini tablet in premium smartphone awesome fit for me as phablet user but expensive and wheres the stylus support like tablet did such inch phone yes but where the stylus
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,all this is faster than is all marketing bs to hook you into buying their product when more true can say for fact that the qualcomm snapdragon gen has enough power to run any android game you throw at it even up to date
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wont lie this phone will be the perfect fit for me excellent phone no doubt
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,will iphone series remove that notch island am not certain that such solution could handle not just the face id recognition of apple but the front camera needs to be better for the newly introduced feature by apple ie eye tracking controls so doubt it will be thre case with series
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,basically pro max plus with new processor
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,at fps will eat up your storage gb base model is no more realistic why are you complaining about the base model on the pro max comment section lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this year upgrade is all about ai which is not available yet other then that nothing substantial to upgrade from pm but yes if you are old generation holder then go for basic iphones are more promising and are at par with performance with last year pro models this year upgrade for pro is meah or next to none and please dont give me that raw computational power speech no one on ios uses their mobiles to full potential in android you can literally do much more with your phone but yes quality and eco sustem of ios and aoftware support is remarkable
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,seen in peoples hand still battery mah not confirmedz it has about hours longer battery life compared to the pm very impressed with apples flagship this year battery has always been huge deal for me as its one of the main factors in choosing the right phone to buy will definitely get this one when save up enough
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,for gb and hz display thats pathetic you are so mistaken
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is the new photographic style abailable through ios for pro max that filter one
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,latest snapdragon gen beats anything apple has lmao its not even out yet
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it doesnt need to be phones being faster than laptops is useless given that its more all this is faster than is all marketing bs to hook you into buying their product when reality its all the same even to year old phones still do what they do to this day highly doubt like of phone users even push their phones to the limit other than basic browsing streaming or social media stuff for insta tiktok etc only thing that change is price every year they sneakily hike prices by or even more until its too late becomes the norm
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,most people dont care about it they just live life well dont care either im not an apple person im android person and still love it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone is far better then any samsung phone just look at the benchmarks between them both more yes exactly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bro my motorola edge beats the camera the battery by little and the hzmine has hz more and the edge pro beats hz refresh rate with hz refresh rate
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,benchmarks arent everything the snapdragon is better than the in benchmarks but more latest snapdragon gen beats anything apple has
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no usb support this sucks
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is your phone faster then laptop it doesnt need to be phones being faster than laptops is useless given that its just much better to experience the same thing on laptop bigger screen better cooling an actual physical keyboard etc and to answer your question yes it is phones with the gen are more powerful than bunch of laptops and the upcoming gen will probably be faster than apples in the same tasks
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,instead all the arguing in the comments about iphone vs samsung whos better own both devices and enjoy the best of both worlds
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,too big im switching to android which one do you get an sultra
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this phone should be less than dollars wish granted cent on amazon
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,in fact the iphone is still slightly inferior to the th gen which uses gb ram ufs lp it will be interesting to see how the snapdragon gen with lpddr compares to the pro chipset the difference with lpddr is almost equal as seen in the comparison between the zte nubia pro plus and the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post nothing is impossible to achieve one must remember the reason why the iphone does not want fast charging watts because this phone is very durable lasting up to generations and still sought after if apple followed the android concept the iphones exclusive rights could be lost the iphone will remain in good condition regarding battery health even if it supports watts this is just rumor made up logically if an expensive phone like the iphone cannot handle high watts it means the phone is very weak and cheap until now flagship chinese phones capable of handling watts since have not experienced battery explosion issues fully hope that the iphone pro max will offer more innovation than just trivial things like the action button and ios updates want the iphone to learn from the huawei ultra which left us amazed
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,for the first time dont have the passion to have either iphone nor samsung
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post of course iphone cpu is state of the art especially this latest variant
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,for those slandering apple pro max phones please go to gsm pages of ephemeral chinese phones no one is forcing one to buy apples phones thank you
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its massive do not see problem for instance samsung dimensions are mm in while pro max has only more weight it si almost all screen apple mm in and pro max is only
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its too expensive and every time same shapes and same body dont no why we love more its massive
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,mr sep chipset is theirs too so no accountability who knows if its really improving or same as more am so critical of the iphone because want the iphone to listen to its loyal customers not because hate the iphonethis is so that the iphone is willing to upgrade more and is willing to add more innovation rather than playing it safe come on iphone show your best ability on the iphone pro max generation want to see real flagship phone that beats other chinese phones iphone pro max iphone pro max iphone promax samsung ultra moment
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this is too small
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ill definitely be grabbing one day
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apples fate is just waiting for time like nokia because it is too greedy nokia went bankrupt for years next iphone chinese mobile innovation is increasing every year while iphone is stuck on iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yes and the assembly of the iphone does not include sorting costs only per iphone accord more by selling strong and luxurious brand name apple can generate more net profits than other brands this is the most reasonable reason why apples shares are in the top see see
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its so beautiful that it can hypnotize you action buttons or shortcut buttons can be ap more yes and the assembly of the iphone does not include sorting costs only per iphone according to the chinese technician apples production costs without advertising and distribution costs are only
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,absolutely beautiful its so beautiful that it can hypnotize you action buttons or shortcut buttons can be applied directly to the cellphone screen so what upgrade does apple saythe chipset is also only equivalent to the th gen which is just better optimized remember that the iphone is only distribution iphone parts purchased from china the original price of raw iphone without assembly is just selling the brand can make you amazed
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,absolutely beautiful
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone still stuck at gbhz but kfps dont think apple can make any big improvement other than giving new chipset and slightly better camerasthats what happens to all other phones not only apple unless its chinese one where they reinvent the wheelwhat do you want apple to bring boys other than that
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,meh imma upgrade when my phone reaches ios but great phone tho
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im an iphone pro max user but theres still hanging out freezing constant warm more tell me where did you buy it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im still using my pro from the only way ill upgrade is if apple adds ho more no need to update such phones for at least four years otherwise would not give so much money
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,maybe bigger battery made inches bigger and obviously new better chipset few tweaks here and there but its still iphone pro max format
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,best phone on planet earth apple is apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,by the looks of it youtube reviewers are finally waking up to this nonsense of apple marketing im not surprised apple failed
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,who the hell sell the iphone pro max for on amazoncom thats boost mobile for ya
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,everybody want or higher optical zoom for new iphone because the price always up
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,every body love iphone say let me hustle this year and know if my money can buy it god call on you please help me this year let me see destiny helper
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,tb tax included
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gig ram for ai is rip off will be holding on to my pro max till see at least gig ram or gig ram model
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple nowadays is the square enix of mobiles they fail so hard and they are overpriced why would someone buy that waste of time
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,of course otherwise they would have made big thing about it in the presentation yesterday more iphone still stuck at gbhz but kfps
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no reason to upgrade from pro max to pro max no major improvement well see what pr more there are some nice new features like new sensitive button larger display better chip including much better npu am also waiting for next generation and definitely will switch from samsung to apple like that ai will not depend so much on clouds and that apples policy is the ondevice ai of course like that chatgpt will be more integrated into ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,very expensive for smartphone that does only phone stuff samsung is offering dex mode and expands the usability of its top of line but it plays aaa games yeah but on tiny screen
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and how much is samsung galaxy fold tb version in europe for reference tb
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pre order started but battery mah not confirmed
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,in greece this cost euro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,because ios is slowly getting better while google keeps removing freedom from android and ot more if only ios allowed us to install ipa files easily as apk files on android without restrictions id switch to ios for now ill stay with android until google remove every freedom that they are trying to do on android
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gb ram for phone is wild tb costs in europe
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so just compared the pro max and the pro max theres no difference in the camera te more wait for youtuber review it there should significant upgrade for ultrawide
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,big lies for matured man like you do you even have vivo ultra have vivo ultra and samsung galaxy ultra and vivo ultra is the jpeg king
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,android will never be extinct and no one could do that and worser is bad english android full of exploits especially for pegasus and predator
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,mean brick
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,better buy honor than this block
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,used iphone also used most samsung phones and ngl iphones are way better in most cases sorry but even huawei is better than samsung so stop glazing samsung so much its good phone yes but you cant even compare to iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,but of course you have to give them some credit for the usbc ai ios and whatever camer more yeah right and android needs like companies to beat apple alone lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,mp selfie camera since is bad practice for iphone selfie camera must be need mp samsung su has mp front facing camera too
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,didnt buy it but can say there will be no major difference between it and iphone pro ma more so ur saying the percent better cpu and gpu mean nothing mb of total cach means nothing the single core leaked score means nothing also even if the antutu benchmark works differently on apple because of the different program language iphone pro max still surpassed the samsung galaxy ultra and lets talk about the hour battery life ive been using samsung galaxy ultra for the past months and trust me im welling to sell it and buy an iphone pro max the moment they are available in stores
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,samsung or rog phone would still absolutely crush the iphone in every single thing still more because ios is slowly getting better while google keeps removing freedom from android and other phone makers remove hardware features like micro sd slot and headphone jack people who still want to use android are probably on older versions of the os and those people like me would probably not mind switching back to iphone switched to an android because had much more freedom with android and jailbreaking ios was popular to get similar features now android phones usually have locked bootloader which is more difficult to unlock and root also could replace the battery extremely easily in my android phone the only main issue with apple is part serialization and no sideloading support add both of those and may switch
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,those numbers are still nothing compared to samsung galaxy ultra and can say that becaus more buddy youre not even sure if its pro or not you have no clue whats going on typical android cope
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,every year with slight change and great price increase idk where you are but price in us is still the same as past few year and in some country like mine this year iphone price is down usd compare to last year series
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,megapixels dont matter at all if you look at actual cameras you wont see many over more those numbers are still nothing compared to samsung galaxy ultra and can say that because my dad owns one and my older cousin has an iphone or pro one so can compare them to pro max because apple didnt do many changes in the camera compared to the iphone series so have already noticed the picture quality of ultra and the iphone and samsung is really catching up with apple in the best camera race and maybe they already surpassed apple so basically iphone cameras numbers are maybe nothing compared to samsungs numbers already thats my opinion
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,inches youre kidding why is the display on this bigger than on the plus model
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,think if steve jobs still alive iphone series wouldnt be like this yeah and steve jobs would make android go extinct and iphones would be very worser
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my phone doesnt have headphone jack and pc or laptop is unnecessary in my life more next time if possible buy wired hires headphones and dont forget to buy dac for phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nor will they need ghz cpu titan frame ceramic glass ai etc companies are just adding use more jiust stick with chinese phones strongly recommend to you
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still there is no fps slow motion recording
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wireless charging for the end of is wild
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hz refresh rate in hz refresh rate come on apple at this point why not go to hz
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,regular consumer wont need and zoom in their daily lives nor will they need ghz cpu titan frame ceramic glass ai etc companies are just adding useless stuff to justify price hikes innovation only comes from chinese companies western people have been brainwashed so much that they would pay for pile of shit just because they saw fancy advertisement promising eternal life by eating that shit
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im an audiophile im using highend headphones audeze lcd with chord hugo da more my phone doesnt have headphone jack and pc or laptop is unnecessary in my life only need phone or of them bluetooth is my only option or wifi but like portable speakers or devialet phantom speakers expensive but worth it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,love apple products
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,mp is nothing ai processing chalkboard painting looking photos and ai deletes small detai more big lies for matured man like you
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bluetooth hifi is the future am bluetooth speaker lover bluetooth is faster and you ca more im an audiophile im using highend headphones audeze lcd with chord hugo dac or fiio dap thats another wasted money just because they dont think about it they should especially since airpods are always new but they dont even think about such things like max possible audio quality in that case would only need an amplifier and not waste money on dac and dap of course this is an mobile phone it is not device intended directly for audio but if apple wants to be number one let them adjust what could be adjusted and not release similar model thats almost same as last year ps im listening through cable headphones not bluetooth thats for peoples that dont know about audio too much
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone doesnt so much ram as droid can put gb on droid and its still piece of st comp more that is fine measurement guess
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,in the age of and zoom apple launch useless cameras at all in pastcalled king more regular consumer wont need and zoom in their daily lives
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just gb ram the phone couldnt even run resource intensive games whereas android more iphone doesnt so much ram as droid can put gb on droid and its still piece of st comparing iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im surprised that the maximum possible audio playback quality has not changed it does more bluetooth hifi is the future am bluetooth speaker lover bluetooth is faster and you can take the speakers with you no wifi needed when you next time connect bluetooth it automaticly connects when the speaker is on bluetooth is faster iphones have air play but android phones do not
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and what about the ecosystem integration customer aftercare software support hello biggest ecosystem used on planet is google and android is based on it you can do literally everything apple does and you still have way more options to choose from and wdym customer aftercare if you mean repair shops than every single brand has its own limits if your in asia huawei and honor have top tier service but since apple doesnt have as many repair centers here than rd party ones do the trick and same is other way around in america in usa you guys have top tier apple service but brands like huawei and honor might lack in that aspect at the end its about where you live not about costumer aftercare
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,theres no point in apple in doing when theyre literally the best in the game wh more it took while for apple to make standard gig ram
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,oh look guys its iphone but bigger and it costs only what an innovative wa more and what about the ecosystem integration customer aftercare software support
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,what watt charge should we use for pro maxw or at least
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,going buy for fps in the age of
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,looks exactly the same as the pro max from years ago that will make ip stay relevant in the market
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nope it doesnt have countless android flagships beat it badly like honor sammy or zte without trusted security all the features in android are useless for me
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,they rereleased the iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its and iphone still using watt charger wtf its just expensive crap
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no change pro max same design no improve
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,back in the days were inch considered to be tablet
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,only has gigs of ram it is laughable in this phone gonna be slow as nokia where is audio jack and ir blaster all other chinese phones have it and iphone doesnt why
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,isnt oled good my note has better screen than this thing yes but samsung galaxy has super amoled
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its funny my year old samsung can do and this cant
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,android phones last way longer aware that iphone with slower charging is saving battery for the phone to last longer
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the phone remains very unchanged theres new button new chipset and more screen in the same dimensions guess new ultrawide not worth it for the price tag
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,when android going to be notchless get iphone first one
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,fun fact is can read only what is the specs bcz cant buy it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bro swear looked at the trailer saying improved battery and chuckled knowing that their more the battery capacity does not matter the iphone pro max have longer battery life than those android phones that has more than mah
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone renamed actually has the capture button which is sensor
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,they finally have hz the first iphones that had hz were the pro and pro max im pretty sure yes the standards still have and the standards have had hz sense the iphone or im pretty sure
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,how many mah battery is in iphone pro max mah is weakness for competitor lol the capacity of battery doesnt matter the iphone pro max has in longer battery life than others android phones that has mah
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,tell me when you guys can change the kernel on it jajajaja
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,buy samsung galaxy ultra is better currently now am using an samsung galaxy device need change thats why selected the iphone like samsung and iphone devices
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,in my humble opinion this year apart from htz display iphone and plus are better options pro models are good but this is typical apple way of doing things and guys relax you cant have improvement every single year and as far as design is concerned so smart phones have reached to ots pinnacle what else designer can do make phone woth triangular display or oval or square or even better round one like seriously the screen to body ration is already phenomenal on todays smart phone and flag ships of every company what we need is better battery life software and its support better cameras better internals and they had already done it what more to ask buddies just chill if you feel like having one and of you can afford one just go for it if not then there are plenty good and respectable options in android world or in used mobile market by the end of the day its just phone with primary purpose of keeping you in touch with others the rest is luxury at best peace
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,buy pro max its the same device iphone pro max is old now and am more interested in or pro max and pro max not much difference design wise
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its really goodbut cant purchase it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,again bluetooth and missing bluetooth codecs wow dont care if apple has loyal more im surprised that the maximum possible audio playback quality has not changed it does not exceed bitkhz via internal dac thats something to think about for example samsung latest model ultra have maximum of bitkhz audio quality playback thats literally studio quality for almost same price compared to iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,fps our samsung with fps im using an iphone bought in no battery changed or any kind of repairs and still useful know no samsung this lifespan reliability
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im so impressed by apples new revolutionary design its almost more yeah its true
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still that notch yeah androids are so innovative with that hole punch its been how long now
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just wait bit the prices are surely going to come down not likely until mid to end of next year you barely get any discounts on apple products even on amazon maybe if youre lucky then off for new year
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,will change my iphone pro max when they really make some good changes because till now they are reselling the same thing the same design and is just little insignificant upgrade so we need some really changes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,on apples website said pro max has hours more battery life than pro max during video more highly doubt that number from rumours the capacity is only increased slightly and not massive last year sony xperia vi with fhd screen took the crown for longest battery life of all smartphones if what you are saying is true then pro max will take that crown
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,they both compensate themselves so it doesnt need to be specifically advantageous pe more on apples website said pro max has hours more battery life than pro max during video streaming
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the bigger screen and the bigger battery as well they both compensate themselves so it doesnt need to be specifically advantageous personally like smaller form factors with large battery life but pro battery life is pathetic
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,most new features like shutter button were in sony xperias already my current and over year more the bigger screen and the bigger battery as well
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still no recordinghow funny because of us have tvs or monitors
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple did something good with their cameras although am not going to buy the iphone pro more most new features like shutter button were in sony xperias already my current and over year old xperia ii also have it but the wow factor is the touch induced shutter controls also it is nice to see pro features from sony on pro models apart from these rest all same to pro max excluding the chip and wide camera mp
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no clue of the battery capacity
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just prepared the preorder for pro max tb at in germany along with silicon case
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,notch is best because it support faceid faceid works in complete darkness and very reliable compare to those punch hole face recognition they ramp up the display light and blinds you just to see your face and good luck with fingerprint when you wearing gloves the issue is software sure now apple have ai helping you to do stuff and that huge inches screen but you as the human is limited to app per time audio source per time video source per time very very shameful look at macos everything video runs every audio streams perfectly and multiple apps on the screen even ipad is guilty of this chip and yet once you launch game thats it it takes everything no audio from other sources all video pause hurray app in inch screen good job but will apple change no because casual do not care
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why just gigs of ram
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yeah androids are so innovative with that hole punch its been how long now actually some have in display camera now but quality needs improving rather have pinch hole over notch
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,omg hm for trade in with pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bruhhhhh it is written that this has nm cpu hell nah if this is real then we may be see great comparitions between this iphone and the whole market
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,listen to me be patient save your money and buy when it launches the iphone ultra in more source trust me bro gb tb gb tb gb gb think iphone pro max with gb tb in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,good choice to last until it breaks and switch to the iphone pro max dont buy the one more listen to me be patient save your money and buy when it launches the iphone ultra in because iphone will release ai siri which can communicate without any delay this is amazing and premium ai features for free which can make our work easier and think like humans note this costs gbtb am from the future
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ill keep my pm till forever change the battery recently and good to golol good choice to last until it breaks and switch to the iphone pro max dont buy the one with ai usually there will be reduction in quality
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hopefully let not ram again of course otherwise they would have made big thing about it in the presentation yesterday is coming with iphone pro or air or however they are calling it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,boring phone my poco way better
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no mp cam mah batt and gigs of ram as usual of course
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,imagine operating mm big gm heavy phone without universal back gesture pain in the hand
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is slow id rather have if anything bare minimum is safe and nowhere near more is perfectly acceptable imho my phone is also for reference but its abysmal on any phone beyond
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,already love it im hoping to get one for christmas xx
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple why not fingertips and ir
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,whats the ram on this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,money of course they are all big companies are always hungry for more money by doing the littlest effort youre not discovering the wheel
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont buy this phone samsung is better
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple should bring the ultra version
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,desperate for what money
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont buy this phone reasons mp expensive and oled buy this phone reasons hz more isnt oled good my note has better screen than this thing
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple is desperate at this point hahaha desperate for what
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hot take but the pm is better value especially considering that its going to be cheaper now that the pros came out yes there are cool new upgrades with the pros but the upgrades are honestly so minor that you might as well save bit of money and get last years pros
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,watts charging is for smartphone addicts proper people with job dont need wat more im sure people with jobs are the ones who actual benefit from super fast charging the only way it wouldnt matter is if you work from home where you have permanent access to charging outlet
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,rip to third party cases
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone with extra button xd
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my own phone is iphone plus battery health now want to buy this iphone promax gb is enough for me for editing videos captures pictures texting
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,theres no significant or advanced specs comparing to the pro max almost the same
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,now it looks like fake version from wish with that fat dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nothing cinematic mode
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,duude fps is sooo minblowingi think fps is amazing what about fpsthe full more oneplus did it years ago
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dr watson sep well yeah thats how tech upgrades work but unless youre either diehard app more if its what makes you happy you can upgrade why do you think people buy expensive houses yet its the same sleep
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,after long waiting here is the iphone the most advanced till date definitely will purchase iphone pro max soon
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wow so they managed to make the phone bit bigger did not expect this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,disgusting phones same island same design
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ill give you one fact iphones ai or anything like that is bullshit ive see more agree they are trying to maximise effect with fewer mpx cameras just to earn more money with less capable and cheaper hardware apple is doing it also with lesser ram by optimisation of operating system but this time this policy cannot hold because of ai development
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,think apple should now work on extending battery life to minimum of days for all its pricey products good features though
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nothing special island cutoff is extremely large it can be inches display but the island more ill give you one fact iphones ai or anything like that is bullshit ive seen comparison of the iphone pro max vs pro max the results of the ai camera test at distance of meters the iphone ai camera cannot read the writing because the ai effect is very strange and bad while the pro max can see the written object perfectly and can be read well the conclusion is currently the builtin ai on cellphones is only an early version it will take another years before the ai camera can be considered useful
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post well yeah thats how tech upgrades work but unless youre either diehard apple fan or you just like to upgrade asap you realize you dont need to upgrade your phone each year right
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,are they serious android will annonce charging what apoor ios user watts charging is for smartphone addicts proper people with job dont need watts charging apple understands that concept well
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no same display aka pixel series
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just recycled from the previous teration nothing special island cutoff is extremely large it can be inches display but the island is simply so ugly on all iphones dynamic future cannot compensate for ugliness an gb of ram will not support ai in two years because it is simply too small buyers will be fooled like in the case of iphone pro max which without ai is already in stone ages
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,screenshot this and challenge openly apple add as much tech you want thats good features are usefull for many all this but thats like no ones actually gonna use so much anyways its just the basics bigger battery all phones need hour plus screen time good brightness more storage iphone cannot do multiple apps at once still no dual whatsapp or any such dual app still worst is the phone guarantee is not going to work in real world more than min as its going to heat up all this needs cool environment only so stay indoor under air conditioner and all of use it ok outdoor everywhere around the world now temperature is to degrees hot the only phone that works outdoor properly are phones with best cooling and nits up phones under sun and big battery mah plus stop wasting money rather buy newest android folding phone so it has big screen also so no need for tablet also and android all apps games etc is available easily cheaper or even free with tb usb drive to store backup your pics videos which you can use forever with any phones and laptop pcs best is charges also within minutes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why dudes tweakin bout the charging speed like who tf charges his phone with wexcept bbk users
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hdr is impressive know my sony could do but not with hdr or stabilization
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so it didnt come with samoled after all
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you do not understand this has all bands and wifi smartphones got wifi before italy routers and modems are dead its all hotspots from now on
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it record video with fps

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nice refresh with ai bloat
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just paid my tmobile bill couple days ago im surprised most people still buy an ipho more most people dont care about it they just live life
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,looks like an iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple never listens to users the issues that make users sick to the stomach some useful more hey download swiftkey keyboard for your iphone it works flawlessly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone display will be absolute monster
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,allready talk non sensevivo its better in photos compare to any apple series longer more do have it lol and as was saying ultra is good at daytime photos and will give you some corrections about your reply vivo its better in photos compare to any apple series daytime quite subjective but lowlight not even close longer battery life charging cycles definitely thats why prefer to use it on gaming since it has longer battery and faster charging better telephoto agree better screen totally agree software yes apple still doing no prefer android since it got more features if could only have one would choose the vivo since need the longer battery but im just being honest on how was quite disappointed on its camera during lowlight
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,vivo ultra already lost to iphone pro picked it up because of it is comparable to more allready talk non sensevivo its better in photos compare to any apple series longer battery life charging cycles better telephoto better screen software yes apple still doing but you saying lost allready because dont even got so many like you got opinion about something they dont have
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,agreed vivo ultra is terrible at low light but mp landscape photography is amazing more have you tested you dont even got the phone and found it terrible vivo ultra is right now second after oppo ultra in photos video overall performance and user experience in battery department got charging cycles mha capacity welli know quess what own both oppo and vivo
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,same mp sensor hmmmm this is gonna be fun vivo ultra vs iphone pro max more vivo ultra already lost to iphone pro picked it up because of it is comparable to google pixels camera but with better chipsd gen but its only good during daytime in lowlight however it could not even beat my iphone pronot even close mainly use my vivo ultra for gaming now since my iphone pro drains quite fast during gaming if have known it before shouldve gotten cheaper xiaomi phone for gaming instead
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ios works differently and often doesnt even utilise the entire gb ram ram management in ios more yea sure for apple always different somehow ios escaping physicality of how ram and operating systems workswell yes it can be optimized at some level but it does not mean that stuff that needs ram will magically use less ram with ios apple fans sell same story for macbooks and actually used one for pro with gb ram and it felt to me like shity lagg comparing with linux notebookmultitasking and load times are slower on apple fortunately didnt buy that macbook apple can include much higher speeda memory higher capacity battery but hey they need insane profit margins soo gl
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gb ram in on phone this must be joke but isnt ios works differently and often doesnt even utilise the entire gb ram ram management in ios is wayyyy different
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,with all this enormous huge size the battery should be milliamp at least let users use more chinese phones have mah batteries yet this phone will still run circles around them in battery life happens every single year
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,sadly sony stole shutter button from microsoft lumia you can check for example microsof more sharp sh says hi
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,only with phones plus ultra and tab plus and ultra even older ultra charges at cant say same about apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple be like hey theres capture button that sony made lets steal sadly sony stole shutter button from microsoft lumia you can check for example microsoft lumia xl it was beast back in day

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone pandemic premium android phones increasingly resemble the apple flagship the pixel galaxy and other flagship android phones are increasingly looking like the iphone as manufacturers try to win over apple users with innovation and design as for the prices for new iphones you can see them at wwwtelekopluscom ordered my last iphone from them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,anyone know where to get the leaked render wallpaper zedge
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,charge ohh sorry wired charging at

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this yettobereleased phone is already months in the database one way to get views even more yes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so every year the processors becomes smaller and smaller so when it goes to nm then what size more
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,lol just with different wallpaper it isnt really the same phone as the pm since it has new chip which is also full of ai which also means that the chip will be better sync with apple intelligence the only cool things coming from the pm are that the chip will be better the capture buttons and the silent switch getting removed and replaced with custom bind button what as matter of fact is also cool is that the iphone pm will have smoother dynamic island one of the stuff that is upgrading is also the battery since it increases by mah greetings iphone defender
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,incredible new phone new design functions ai wait it and love it my god apple give me two oh
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,looks exactly like my iphone pro max lol and the

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bet it gonna be expensiver than samsung tv ask santa for one he always comes thru
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its before on sony apple copying sony features lol apple be like hey theres capture button that sony made lets steal
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple is all about tricks lets see what kind of rubbish are they gonna sell for skyhigh pric more bet it gonna be expensiver than samsung tv
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,some part from iphone has slow to upgrade just proud about security and privacy but upgrade some need to waiting for decade
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its years of major os updates and years of security updates its years of updating software maybe
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why do people even still buy apple phones what waste
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ay my place just got some banger cases for this bad boy where should post pics of it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,when was the last time samsung delivered not talked about it huge difference years more its years of major os updates and years of security updates
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it clearly says wireless wired
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,rip iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,might skip this year seems like no innovative features are coming aside from ai with the improve megapixel count on ultra wide camera how often do you use it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,omg is too big its definitely big no for me thats what she said
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wow same like pro max note physical change
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just cant wait to hear their next magical expression on the september after capture button and dynamic island can they be any more creative mean these are absolutely nothing spectacular but their always present it like something never seen before lets guess any ideas
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,capture button its before on sony apple copying sony features lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the number best answer so far
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well to buy pro max is not an option its just to big and going from pro to pro its just stupid so just wait year longer and get the pro with same inch screen pro gb of ram and think the pro suppose to be with no de at all so its cool
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,tyusb typec gen displayport
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,one step closer to iphone xxx this is roman im sure
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so they could not change the style of the back camera what design do expect them to use camera lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,weight of gms
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this is incredible years in row identically design no changes they are joking with peop more and what exactly do you expect triangular phone or what
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,know what your going to say but iphone is supposed to get eye tracking watch ui go crazy more give star if its shown that way
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so why do people buy samsung if their lives are in danger apple said they would replace it wi more never said they arent buying them and you should probably read the whole reply and previous comments to understand the context and not cherry pick one metaphor can you give the link to apples official statement about it or perhaps you are talking about rumors from some random twitter account
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so couple issues about your asinine comment cause couldnt help myself samsung more lol the article you posted is literally rumor not apples official statement keep hallucinating again they promised to do it but your only evidence to it is literally trust me bro because they have never done it before and you have to wait till so they can prove it for example apple has proved themselves with xr since and people dont need to wait till next decade to make sure their phone lasts long with major software updates apple also promised about airpower and we saw how that went pro supports gbps and its first generation but su tops out at gbps this is proved in both gsm review and youtube videos httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvuuffifenf
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,currently have the iphone hope to get this or the pro soon
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so when you zoom upto it becomes generative even when its cat or human your more pro max has two times less zoom than note ultra lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,trust me bro is not something to rely on in tech google as multitrillion dollar more so when you zoom upto it becomes generative even when its cat or human your zooming into lol apple cant get over the fact that their pro max cant zoom more than note ultra from years ago despite having mp periscope like the note
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you seem to hallucinate lot first you believed you live in and samsung has delivered more so why do people buy samsung if their lives are in danger apple said they would replace it with an under display face id
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,what does dynamic island got to do with tech it is disgusting anomaly it is more you seem to hallucinate lot first you believed you live in and samsung has delivered years of os update in reality we live in and samsung has never done such thing ever before now you bring the whataboutism card out and claim apple has promised to remove the pillshaped hole in the screen they never did which funnily enough exists on almost every smartphone including su in different shapes and sizes depending on functionality except some rare gaming phones with horrible selfie camera am happy to hear what modern flagship smartphone currently has all screen display with tiny bezels depthbiometrics sensor in front at the same time speaking of whataboutism why did samsung put the lives of their customers in danger with releasing of note why did they lie even after recalls only to put the lives of people in danger again
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pro max looks goodi wish ir icluding alsoplz
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hope that this gen of iphones is as good as the or series as in that they arent revolutionary but they were competitive with android phones and even were ahead in tech despite no design overhaul really dont want repeat of the lineup sent from galaxy fold for the people that think am an apple sheep
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,crazy how they still havent reduced the obnoxious dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im probably going to hold on to my pro max when the comes out if im not getting the more trust me bro is not something to rely on in tech google as multitrillion dollar company with an army of dead projectpromises is prime example coincidentally they were first to promise years everyone process their images but crazy high digital zoom with android phone is more like generative ai rather than you taking the picture fake moon on samsung is just one example
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why not make it then lets welcome the tablet as new phone size now
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,time to hit gym if is too heavy for you im not insulting but its not heavy more hey do you guys remember the pro max it weighed grams
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im really curious to see how the apple iphone pro max will be compare to iphone pr more im probably going to hold on to my pro max when the comes out if im not getting the then ill wait for the for personal reasons as for your ultra vs pro max cant really say which one to get as the hasnt come out yet but it will soon if you value productivity and camera ai tricks then go for the ultra if not then you could probably wait
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so it was released this year which means is the earliest date we can confirm their claims more this is not xiaomi they will thats your opinion not fact in my opinion iphone is better because it doesnt destroy the original image with all that ai crap that samsung uses after certain point everyone does ai crp on their photos everyone your regular photos especially with blurred background are ai photos try to take photo of yellow sign outside youll see how iphone performs bad compared to for example samsung there is no perfect camera on small sensors that phones have and they use ai to compensate it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,cool specs
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thats your opinion not fact in my opinion iphone is better because it doesnt more when was the last time samsung delivered not talked about it huge difference years of update to their phones cant remember it probably you dont remember because su is the first samsung with guaranteed years of major os updates and to your poor knowledge su was released january before commenting something about other companies products do small research on that beautiful samsung screen on your iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the mp still provides better shots than apple gimmicky mp and also they would receive more thats your opinion not fact in my opinion iphone is better because it doesnt destroy the original image with all that ai crap that samsung uses after certain point how do you know it gets years of update do you have time machine from when was the last time samsung delivered not talked about it huge difference years of update to their phones cant remember it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,phones should have years major os update by default anyway and there is nothing gua more the mp still provides better shots than apple gimmicky mp and also they would receive years of updates because the will recieve years of updates and because they are samsung not some less known manufacturer
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,can tell me what samsung does every year as an upgrade are they suppose to wait for samsung to upgrade
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,how to get this wallpaper
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ultra ultra just few new things years of guaranteed major os updates ye more phones should have years major os update by default anyway and there is nothing guaranteed from either samsung or google about their years of os update simply because they have never done it before these are just meaningless words at the moment until next decade iphone xr midrange from is getting years of major os update samsung from the same year went obsolete only years later most of the ai stuff are just software based that need internet connection and some of them were released for older phones so thats not an upgrade to su even telephoto camera was worse compared to su at least according to mrwhosetheboss since it went from optical to brightness is still lower than iphone based on gsm benchmarks even when it was released months after them if we look closely other than antireflective display samsung is not any better than apple for releasing the same phone with some tweaks every year
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and there we go with buttons on the iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,is it safe to charge an iphone with android charger hi generally safe to charge an iphone with an android charger if you use compatible cable like usbc to ensure the charger provides stable power output of volts to avoid any potential damage its also best to stick to standard charging and avoid fast charging to prevent any issues using highquality charger from reputable brand is recommended for safety and efficiency
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,same like my iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,there are still make me think about will this cpu getting upgrade or same cpu on pro max but have imagine if cpu will use apple pro nm hexacore ghz ghz and gpu still same like pro max core graphics
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pretty same ol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,watt wired charging must be some young kid lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,when will they remove that useless dynamic island should have atleast smaller punch hole fo more heard from rumors that apple was supposed to remove it on the seriesbut theyre just rumors for right now am looking forward to it though
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this thing gonna be heavy as hell lol time to hit gym if is too heavy for you im not insulting but its not heavy battery itself weighs probably about gg
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why iphone low battery mah because the processor is nm its very saver battery
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,have both iphone pro and samsung and hardly use it is slow and sluggish have samsung galaxy and im not complaining it works very well
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,say what you want about apple but screen to body ratio on flat screen is an incredible more not that itd matter with the dynamic island unfortunately still great achievement but not my kinda style
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,worldwide best selling brand is samsung second apple because they are selling ridiculous shovelled cheap budget phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nice phone but would have worked out with massive mah or mah ever heard of ipad its very similar looking big phone with same ui and features
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if the phone is to come with mah battery or mah battery it will explode such battery increase comes with an increase of weight and size
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,and if somebody try to compete with the ecosystem and comes close with quality and prices more love when people try to mock another brand without even using them can bet last samsung or any other android youve used was like years ago right if we compare device to device samsung devices are more premium more features more choices to make your phone to work like you want and so on open your eyes and enjoy good technology nowadays android is not the same as it was years ago
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,exactly as you said iphone is the most luxurious brand loved by almost everyone they laugh more and if somebody try to compete with the ecosystem and comes close with quality and prices you just banned the bastard wright
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you can be happy with your high spec phone and iphones users would be happy with their low spe more no both phones are smooth and samsung has already integratated ai features before most other manufacturers to create an even faster smoother and reliable phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thatd be an insult to the ultra since it has more superior features like photos more you can be happy with your high spec phone and iphones users would be happy with their low spec smooth phone everyone is happy its win win
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,who is super psyched to see it when its released
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,its not something with hardware specs that makes apple the best it something to do with hardware and software optimization and ios
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,they produce new cars every year what do think be the significant upgrade just know just more no its not lol buying new flagship every single year its money waste not flex
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,imagine chips by tsmc oled displays by samsung and boe camera lenses by sony which means the most essential components of iphones are not from inside but apple still holds the crown
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,now we can say that they have reached the level of the ultra in terms of features thatd be an insult to the ultra since it has more superior features like photos fingerprint reader under display gb ram mah battery expandable storage etc
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,are you ready for the screen protector businessmietubl screen protector for iphone pro max are now available
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,but still the best selling smartphones worldwide best selling brand is samsung second apple
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wake up last major upgrade was back to iphone and maybe iphone they produce new cars every year what do think be the significant upgrade just know just new year phone its enough
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this doesnt feel any like any significant update feel apple is stuck in iphone era more wake up last major upgrade was back to iphone and maybe iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,unnamed jul you are right also stuck at ppi since iphone no hope for qhd display anymore sadly
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,regardless of what others may say we iphone users are not swayed by mere trifles rather we more dont really see how that relates to my comment but ok
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,theyve literally introduced it two generations ago and it brought pretty nice features more regardless of what others may say we iphone users are not swayed by mere trifles rather we prioritize enduring quality with proper care there are no concerns aligning oneself with prestigious brand can elevate ones image and owning an iphone affords me sense of luxury beyond the reach of those unlike ourselves it would be imprudent to insist on something beyond your means
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,let me correct you samsung will make displays for all four iphone models lg will make more lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pro would be sidegrade for pro user what upgrade are we talking about here thats why plan to buy the cheaper iphone pro max and wont be disappointed with its quality love this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,never buy the global version of iphone again just go straight to the apple store in china th more as korean would prefer samsung over iphone also prefer the samsung ultra even though it was released bit late but they will introduce the new snapdragon gen chipset
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,relax friend you just need to be patient and wait for the release of iphone pro max with more agree with you looking at apple over the past years there hasnt been the best improvement just little by little in my opinion even the iphone pro max is better than the iphone pro max model feel its changes wont be for the better and feel this years iphone isnt worth the money actually would feel lucky because the iphone pro max is cheaper than the current model maybe the implementation you mentioned will happen in years in but that wont apply to rich people who can buy it every year so just forget it its just an iphone marketing characteristic im even more interested in huaweis quality which think is equivalent because huawei is more luxurious than the iphone in quotes both are produced in china hahaha
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the above specs shows apple has nothing new to offer just minor changes in exchange for heavy more relax friend you just need to be patient and wait for the release of iphone pro max with even more upgrades and better features than samsungs believe me the pro chipset will have upgrade compared to this year iphone pro max will only make you curious and forget about it when iphone pro max brings mp camera gb of ram and maybe even hz refresh rate with the option of an camera the price will be higher than this year but you wont regret it after buying it this is based on rumors so just wait for another year and see the changes in the exclusive and luxurious quality of iphone pro max that apple is showcasing trust me
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,all three companies are making displays for iphone mainly samsung but apple dont want more samsung mobile also buying display panel from samsung screen manufacturer
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,yours is an exynos version only comes in the snapdragon version
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wait so samsung is making displays for every iphone model but then lg is in charge of the pro more all three companies are making displays for iphone mainly samsung but apple dont want to depend on only one company
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well am sharing my experience not fan boy has been lying just in front of me for more more yours is an exynos version
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apps are the main reason for phone use if phone cant handle apps for whatever reason is then more ehhh another proof you dont know anything about technology plus developers also put more focus on iphone not on samsung there are far less iphones than androids androids have bunch of skins for example one ui hyperos and so on much more functionality on androids as well no they are not putting more focus on iphone its easier to make app compatible with because they have less models mean we are getting more android phones every single year than apple has devices in total did you investigate your issues because never managed to reproduce issues you were describing
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just know it needs an android of gb ram to match apples gb in speed and performance lol it depends what processor is using
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,let me guess its opening instagram slower second let me correct you sammy boy if you upload raw video from pc to smasung to upload on instagram it freezes the same goes for all the other shit apps plus whenever pickup phone is bombarded with of notifications most of them useless ads the list goes on and on and specially for updates its like wait for months to get new update on phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,enhanced specs but still mp front camera better than gimmick mp camera
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gsmarena can add oled display this phone will be apple first nits oled phone let me correct you samsung will make displays for all four iphone models lg will make displays for the iphone pro and pro max boe will make displays for the iphone and iphone plus there is no apple in sentence with making displays only ordering from competitors
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,isnt gb ram enough for any mobile game just know it needs an android of gb ram to match apples gb in speed and performance
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,look up macintosh phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if battery increased like from pro max to pro max then pro max would have mah more wrong xperia vi has best battery score iphone pro max behind
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why for gb bro apple optimizes their chips even tho its gb ram it can run call of duty warzone mobile
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,hell nah iphones are better than samsungs in some cases both samsungs and iphones have their more have both iphone pro and samsung and hardly use it is slow and sluggish
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,aint paying for plus phone with gb ram only no matter how optimised or more then dont buy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,sweetie sensor size plays bigger part in image quality especially on front cam where you don more darling its the exact same as the first apple model to introduce mp front camera that being the whats your point
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple press toothpaste try challenge consumer passion little little change and improved to more they know what theyre doing and people continue to buy iphones if consumers begin to dissatisfy then apple just releases innovation and consumers remain satisfied delayed progress is safety net
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no samsung and xiaomi are most selliyin high end phones if we are talking about highend phones only then apple is by far the most sold brand
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,we dont care we only care about performance thats why apple is the most selling in high end more no samsung and xiaomi are most selliyin high end phones
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,well at least they live longer than other mah flagships yes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,youll wait till to get an apple better than ultra hell nah iphones are better than samsungs in some cases both samsungs and iphones have their pros and cons
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it will remain inch according to rumours also pro probably will become inch hope so inches is absolutely insane
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,good job wired charge is faster is for wireless charge
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,cant with these iphone glazers god give me power well at least they live longer than other mah flagships
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,why is this bigger than the already big iphone plus is the iphone plus cancelled or is more it will remain inch according to rumours also pro probably will become inch
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still the same but different modern flagships be like
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,when android going be notch less like apple android smartphones can do this too the feature just isnt installed by default in the majority of smartphones so people have to do this manually
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if you would have at least working brain cells you would know that size means nothing here more cant with these iphone glazers god give me power
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bring back touch id no never
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,whats your point when android going be notch less like apple it was response to this comment read more carefully to avoid unnecessary questions
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,it literally has big notch called dynamic island or the feature from lg which more whats your point
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,am using ultra but fill missing real premium phone waiting for pro max youll wait till to get an apple better than ultra
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,awful hate this brand have hated wat dot know
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone copypaste with chnages
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,might be the right time to buy an iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,time to say good bye apple phones same from models just camera goes mm down
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,personally would have liked to see the gb ram and tb rom model since theyre extre more veri kool
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,just apple unlock samsung that plans to still use their garbage sensor in main camera as more please no anyway doubt anyone will care what you want
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,we need tb variant personally would have liked to see the gb ram and tb rom model since theyre extremely good at optimizing the system and the various apps
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,stay with my iphone pro max im happy with it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,nickson jun think we all can agree apple just did little bit of the things then make it first they add more firstly no secondly no thirdly no
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,surprisingly apple is overtaking samsung this is done slowly but continuously few years more in what area exactly few years ago samsung was promoting its zoom and then you are talking about cpu what do you see now the processor is overtaking the samsung ultra processor dude what in the world are you trying to say st thing there is no such thing as samsung ultra processor second iphone telephoto is slightly worse compared to samsung especially with su which has telephoto zoom if samsung does not act it will be swallowed by apple in few years sweetie samsung is the best selling brand in the world in almost all of the year every single year the only where samsung is nd is when apple announces new phone of at the top is amazing
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the bezels are incredibly thinner than samsungs wonder what samsung is gonna do dont think its big deal if both bezel designs is subtle
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,those who are saying that apple should change the design of iphones start your own phone compa more lol their room designs and homes must be un changed since years and they wouldnt bother to change it because it costs lot leave years nobody would change their room or home designs every year even changing design for product which is produced in millions of quantity costs huge you have to do proper cost and benefit analysis and changes to many manufacturing centres processes which needs lots of business accumen and such kids dont know thing about it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,theres nothing wrong with lesser battery as long as it runs for full day for more than majority of people by increasing the efficiency of the series cpu apple has environmental goals also and they try to preserve rare earth metals which get used in the batteries big corporates have corporate social responsibility departments also and they have net carbon neutral goals for themselves additionally which typical android companies dont bother about moreover who knows new type of battery technology may get revealed soon like the series cpus which would be more efficient and environment friendly and the world will soon switch over
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wait wait wait this phone is announced on septembre but here theyre revealing more its speculation based on the little that is known and it is easier to create page now and edit the specifics when it is actually revealed or released along with the assumption that it will be similar in appearance and features to the pro max the entire rumor mill section of this website is exactly that phonestabletswatches that very likely going to come out but they have not actually been released yet so most of the information is not known iphones are not usually leaked in the same way that you will known the appearance design and specs of pixel galaxy oneplus etc before release pixels are especially bad for this to the point it is probably marketing strategy
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple has to change its designits been similar design from iphone and so on
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bro hope this year they switch out the outdated hexacores to an octa core config and even tho it still works with hexa it might be lot better if it had octa core
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple are always create new breakthrough and every competitors are following apple path now lets talk about notch design and now theyre have new design call dynamic island and now we can see every competitors are copy that design thats makes sense why apple domination in every aspect
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone will be inches probably thats great size on phone and not on phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,gb of ram is stupid make the devolepers optimize the apps hush you compared to android apple has better optimization on app because android has too many chipset apple have to fix their thermal work think
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,amazing wish one day also own an apple iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,how much fps is this on pubg infinite
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,lol with apple intelligence the old iphone you were clinging on to for years will be gone it has thrown samsung and google ai out of the door
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,as always nothing new most boring phone in award goes to this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,my god they made it even bigger
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,didnt changed no one is being forced to buy this phone if you dont like it you can always leave it
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,whoah looks totally fkn new
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,rumoured specs look awful unacceptable for flagship smartphone only have gb ram not at least more apple optimization on apps are somewhat easier than android probably due to single type of chipset used thus making it ate less ram although personally for me at least gb of ram should be suffice
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple still didnt invent fast charging in
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,seriously the ultraiphone pm is insanely huge for my hands impossible to wield and more this is ultra screen size lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,at one point all mobile manufacturers will reach plateau state which nothing can be improve anymore think its better to increase the duration gap from prev models to the next even longer not every year needs to have newer models instead improve the software features my cents nonetheless profit is the main focus ill have no doubt whatever specs will it brings even its the same as prev just slight improvement on the chipset apple has got its fans that will always keep on track with the latest models
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont they think its too big for smartphone inches for me the limit is only more seriously the ultraiphone pm is insanely huge for my hands impossible to wield and yet people want even bigger
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no charger still gb ram that call high tech phone apple pay lot more than samsung google and sony for less
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,anyone buys this smartphone enables apple tax dogging and anti consumer practices samsung galaxy ultra and sony xperia vi have much better specs build quality
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,does samsung need to even make it slimmer no having no bezel or slimmer than what they have more slight improvements from the promaxnothing special
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,of course they only made spec page for the huge pro max and not the normalsized pro also you could have added the rumored typical brightness of nits vs on promax
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,dont yall think its little too early to release this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,omg iphone pro max released
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,always the sneaaky ios shaady android nor better all the same privacy leakers despite more best was symbian or phones gor privacy guess
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,overrated and boring at this pointsame phone from years ago but with more heat and power why apple cant be more creative with their design like iphone seriesi still think iphone xs max has the best design among all iphones and it had game changing features that could really make me wanna buy an iphonenew ones are just iphone but on steroids
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,up to now no fingerprint on iphone hate iphone without fingerprint
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ugly af quit lusting after it then

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,in samsung and apple will adopt charger samsa mf has charge speed what ur are yapping abt
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,look how thin those becels are compared to the dynamic island
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,iphone please why you are the only popular company who makes one phone with three different variants the whole year yet you run out of design
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,finally the same thing
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if you buy this phone you your self wouldnt realised you have upgraded from iphone pro max to iphone pro max hahaha iphone change your design bit for its becoming boring
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,money pit no impressive features same old design it seems apple is out of options
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the same design continues no changes why the charging speed too is too slow for this calliber of phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wow revolutionary design very unique design since iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple just ran out of innovation supposed they may be tired after all those years when sa more indeed
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so sad that in people still crying over the lack of micro sd and mm headphone jack in more so sad that the other reality is sony and sharp releasing fully feature phones with both sd cards and jacks and samsung as well with xcover proxcover pro that also managed to have ip while having jacks and removable batteries
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,bro need video fps in ths my new phone little bit not same at pmax

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,im sure this phone uses aspect rationot dont think so compare its height and width with meizu note and meizu pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this phone could be competitors in premium classes
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,not only years but years think no years
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,are you joking cams on and and think all have the same sensors so sad that in people still crying over the lack of micro sd and mm headphone jack in samsung flagships dont know when reality will hit them
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,ipad mini exists for reason thats why it have mini tablets for
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thank god for samsung so apple consumers can get bigger size phone now samsung copied leaving out the mico sd expansion and have thier phones pricedover like apple so next year what samsung going to copy next inch ultra that would be nice
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,see at full specifications itll have price around with same spec like pro max but this has upgrade in camera part
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,thats why only buy phones from umidigi umidigi and strawberry fields ever thats why only buy phones from umidigi umidigi and strawberry fields ever is this new way to say youre poor or broken thats fine dude no problem theres always great number and variety of phones for every pocket even for shallow pockets like yours
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,exact same thing as pro max the only changes are screen size very thin bezels and more you really love to contradict yourself in the same comment huh yes they have been using the same general design for years now but theyll bring in new design next year anyway if the rumors of the slim ultra are true the new camera sensors updated chipset new button and new size and dimensions dont make this exactly the same thing as last year the design just makes it similar to last year im not defending apple completely though feel they really should upgrade some of the other specs
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,innovation in apples dictionary means the same thing from last year for thri more thats why only buy phones from umidigi umidigi and strawberry fields ever
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,only really like the display and camera on iphone still no major changes please apple also its bit bigger now
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,typical gsmarena to put phone thats not out until month later so all them fanboy can meatride it and get more comment lol the fold is coming out july and its not on gsm arena pixels are coming out soon and its not still on their forum but seeing the pm already here is funny af
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,inches cant take it its too big
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,people complain that samsung has used the same design for years in row the iphone has had more lol almost every youtuber and tech blogs always points out that the iphone always uses the same design as last year smh
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,android is finished the best phone is coming
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,go and buy tablet then what are you on about the idea of phone is to make it fit thumb more ever heard for sarcasm
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,look guys ill always be an apple critic but damn cant deny this phone looks go more fair enough
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,some people says theres no gb memory or video recording then switch back to android better features than iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,if steve job is still alive then the phone would be different
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,same specs same sht same design same camera is the worst design ever for every generation love iphone so much but am tired for this boring design for generation
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,everything seems to be great except for the rotten dynamic island and still lame charging speeds totally agree the dynamic island is rotten and irritating
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,deleted post please do
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no video recording no buying
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still no gb ram
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,inch is this tablet
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,this bout to cost an arm leg kidney and pancreas lol
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the amount of hate this phone is already getting over three months before its unveiled is str more cant blame them the iphone camera design became so iconic yet so inconveniently overused for the past years would also be mad even if had an iphone or were considering one
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still best phone on the market will buy black gb enough for me best priceperformance phone is iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,was expecting the most slightest to slight change into the phone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,so pretty much the same as pro max but different soc guess there wont be significant changes til the slim
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,come on apple sheeps get in the line for this one
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wow the same with pro max nothing is changed again
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the screen looks beautiful but hate that camera orientation that has been increasing in size for the past years now with no different design would love faster charging too maybe reasonable price or better specs for the lower versions but doubt it really
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the same with pro max nothing is changed again
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,same shit every year every century took them years and years to catch up with huaweis peri scope tele photo and still cant match to this day
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wow cant wait iphone pro max
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,no way gsmarena put the iphone already
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,too big too small this should be size of regular iphone pro should be at least to plus should be to inch and for pro max it should be at least inc device othervise is tiny and useless
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,smaller bezels better specs same design stick with android devices every android has differe more whats the point of different design if you dont own all those smartphones people should care about their smartphones design designers design smartphones for the owners not for random people looking at their photos on the internet
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,still only charging seems like apple wont be using fast charging before when more for wireless charging wired is faster
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,also samsung renaming galaxy and ultra the point is dont more thats why they try to not downgrade them even bit they even keep the same design so that no user would consider the previous model is better than the new one
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,cant say that am actually thinking about that device right now
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,wired charging is faster yes around which is still slow for phone like this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,watts of charging speed wired charging is faster
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,charging wireless what the is this
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,pro will be so it would probably be nice upgrade for pro max owner pro would be sidegrade for pro user what upgrade are we talking about here
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,too big pro will be so it would probably be nice upgrade for pro max owner
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,you just made it to my apple list well done
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,same thing still going on from iphone
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,too big
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,we wait and see how it goes and also wait for xiaomi pro
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,the phone have excellent features but not is repeated
Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Max,apple always keeps focusing on niche stuff like the puzzles size but keep ignoring important features mean who asked for smaller puzzle when the main camera sensor still same for the rd year
Apple,iPhone 16e,rating out of am using months back like battery life its good smooth fast it is affordable need to improve design
Apple,iPhone 16e,of five is still too good mark all recycled iphone and older all more than years old parts or more good chipset but for what its recycling too cheaper to fab those new boards than old ones again ios is more drawback than plus ecosystem walled garden just to have apple logo really people will pay or something for that they dont even really innovate you pay two or three times more for fruit sticker on the back thats about it but its branding get it like buying clothes at prada or at ali express even its the same gorbage in the end its not tech anymore boring
Apple,iPhone 16e,not true always read that its not true in the west at all xiaomi was good ten years more have poco pro and it is cheap for the hardware and has none if the downsides you mention get the feeling you are just biased
Apple,iPhone 16e,xiaomi is much much cheaper ie more cost effective not true always read that its not true in the west at all xiaomi was good ten years ago now its not unreliable spyi callrpc buggy the worst android os value is zero not even sturdy and chinophobe should be cheap and they are not might have crazy battery charging its even worse about reliability and hazardous no no no dont like ios android take same harrible path locking down and sneaking processes anyway and apple was far too greedy again with that phone but xiaomi chinophones no no no at least at their far to expensive price for the krap it is in the west im not goat please dont be one either
Apple,iPhone 16e,survives even what breaks iphones
Apple,iPhone 16e,are you kidding me the iphone has camera sensor worthy of android sm more im not kidding here you go httpswwwredditcomrgalaxyscommentskzuvsublurrycameragalaxysvsiphonee
Apple,iPhone 16e,xiaomi sucks badly and am glad when will replace it maybe for this xiaomi is much much cheaper ie more cost effective
Apple,iPhone 16e,think lenses are better but on flush with the body can make whole apple if you add take and warm it in your hands power on
Apple,iPhone 16e,in india where the prices are generally higher its now available in amazon at usd and with credit card offers bought one yesterday at usd pretty good value at that price
Apple,iPhone 16e,none of the chinese models are that small only the can match it in size but its camera more camera is garbage
Apple,iPhone 16e,other big sites gives much better uptimes think gsmarenas test is unfortunately unrel more agree the conclusion is logical iphone mah iphone mah
Apple,iPhone 16e,batt life lost out to the pro that has mah smaller batt and with hz screen is crazy work for even any hardest ifanatic cmon now this things gb model is priced the same as two aaa batt refurb pro max gb go figure never mind basically every other more capable specced droid flagships out here your choice if youre buying and can afford the full price cash then go ahead else if extending plan no youre dumbass end of
Apple,iPhone 16e,the frequency curve of the phone no judgement is it right
Apple,iPhone 16e,interesting to know was wondering about that think thermal was ok with with and so more yeah had great thermals no throttling and got to and in the macbook air with strong workloads or just game of shadows of the tomb raider it may not be an everyday situation but even allowing it to reach such temps is crazy apple just decided to not throttle for as long as possible throttle as little as possible in exchange for temps being high dont like that approach they are edging the max temps and ultimately hurt longetivity by doing that
Apple,iPhone 16e,this is apples way of spitting in your face and telling you its raining anyone who buys this phone really truly deserves it
Apple,iPhone 16e,yall got so much wrong in this lol first of all im using plus rn and the back is not matte its glossy second of all the internals match that of the iphone not the
Apple,iPhone 16e,suggestion remove the rear camera to make even clearer look and give us discount for the final price of
Apple,iPhone 16e,poco pro slower soc but better main camera vs ois pdaf more loll my father owns pro camera is crap seriosly with light is decentonly decent when light decreases photos are crap so yes pro has very bad camera as usual on poco cheap phones but soc is very good for its price actually is good phone very good for for its price if you dont need good camera
Apple,iPhone 16e,gotta at bh tbh dunno should get instead downgrading from to hell nah rather get used pm
Apple,iPhone 16e,dollars aint nothing compared to the pro or even the is way more than the phone is worth
Apple,iPhone 16e,typical apple making budget phone that nobody asked for and charging an absolut more gotta at bh tbh dunno should get instead
Apple,iPhone 16e,no sim tray on the us version
Apple,iPhone 16e,lol love how every time when iphones get bare minimum memory people will always say that more actually it doesnt need more memory had iphone mini with gb that traded in for base and actually cannot say that one was better than the other for gaming maybe it is different because there the choice of developer plays bigger part
Apple,iPhone 16e,its back side is like iphone xr liked that phone but this is overpriced this is exactly what it is an upgraded iphone xr
Apple,iPhone 16e,seemingly less efficient screen may be the reason screenless battery drain like while using more and zero tech reviewers even check the panel manufacturer
Apple,iPhone 16e,the famous youtuber makhbd announced that the battery lasts more than day all the sites ann more depends if they have standardized test though if not then its all subjective
Apple,iPhone 16e,well theres one reason gb of ram apple will certainly focus optimizing new ios for more lol love how every time when iphones get bare minimum memory people will always say that it does manage the ram better then year after that they will buy new phone cause newer ios needs gb more than what their current device has kek
Apple,iPhone 16e,if the used the same screen panel as the and it might have scored much better battery rating mah battery in body is good step especially when it was previously only reserved for the plus and pro max models
Apple,iPhone 16e,its funny apple are using its amazing price as the main point in the advertising campaign when it is generally seen as the most overpriced poor value iphone ever tone deaf as usual
Apple,iPhone 16e,people who buy this just want the cheapest iphone so maybe parents for their children
Apple,iPhone 16e,the iphone will become the bestselling mobile in history see nothing but praise on the more whilst am sure this phone will sell ton it is not cheap and to be honest it simply is not value for money but am aware that it makes no difference when people want to get an iphone dont know what you have been reading or watching but there have been big tech reviewers who have said this simply isnt value for money or worth it
Apple,iPhone 16e,soc alone may cost this at least despite being hz this screen is at least how can hz screen that doesnt even go all that bright cost so much even some phones come with bigger main canera than that and better screen
Apple,iPhone 16e,what joke eur only gband one main cam backside well played apple your fans pay more for less any year old xiaomi beats this up easily costing just around bucks used main and only backside camera sensor is mm mm pdaf totally absymal specs it does have phase detect af but apple is chickening out with extremely small sensor bet it costs them almost nothing so cheapskate it is
Apple,iPhone 16e,own modem no surprise battery does not last
Apple,iPhone 16e,my ultra will charge from to in little over hours at its rate but at it will take over hours to charge up the iphone the iphone is sure to be the most successful flopped smartphone of all time
Apple,iPhone 16e,yes right here its exactly what im thinking about the iphone expected it to be anot more the mini was always the better design for the se apple messed up here by placing it too close to main models both in terms of design and price people will just buy the or maybe an older iphone at same price whos gonna buy this
Apple,iPhone 16e,so according to gsmarena battery life especially on the web using the internet isnt impressive as opposed to some on youtube who are praising it trust gsmarena when it comes to battery life reviews especially since they reflect reallife usage as experienced it with my pixel pro which has mediocre battery life as was shown in its review over here despite many youtubers claiming it was great which wasnt will skip this phone also it has pretty mediocre camera design ridiculously mediocre cant wait for the iphone air its rumored design is pure
Apple,iPhone 16e,forgot this phone doesnt even have always on besides still having hz panel how ridiculous is that in
Apple,iPhone 16e,an sensor as main camera in europe that phone in the gb version costs more soc alone may cost this at least despite being hz this screen is at least
Apple,iPhone 16e,test battery for idle times how come your battery results are so ass
Apple,iPhone 16e,insurisingly has bad review about ios to me its drawback apple means good ha more
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple already announced that iphone is good option for iphone xr mini owners just bought iphone in exchange of iphone iphone is good upgrade
Apple,iPhone 16e,at this price they shouldve put second camera in it and higher refresh rate screen this isnt budget price anymore but guess they wanted to save slightly in the manufacturing costs and still ask for premium price
Apple,iPhone 16e,thats apple for you their macbook air has really awful thermals that get worse with eve more interesting to know was wondering about that think thermal was ok with with and so on look suspicious to have no fan still great hardware and not as expensive as it used to be apple its allergenic to me anyway
Apple,iPhone 16e,so this is the iphone with the worst rating on gsmarena the second lowest is
Apple,iPhone 16e,maybe look at an iphone pro instead pro is good shout
Apple,iPhone 16e,no always on option so why choose an oled screen then the thing is you clearly dont need an ltpo display for alwayson display so theres no excuse for this or the regular plus to lack aod other than upselling the pros
Apple,iPhone 16e,regular iphones and pros have ois on selfie camera apple just doesnt mention it but teardowns prove that
Apple,iPhone 16e,we appreciate that apple has put the most recent selfie camera with autofocus and possibly ois it seems that not even the regular iphones have ois on the selfie camera
Apple,iPhone 16e,so the good thing about iphone cameras was their natural non oversaturated approach but this looks like an uncharacteristic one what shame
Apple,iPhone 16e,iphone is disaster with single camera instead they should have gone with iphone mini as more coincidence is not the same as intent applel never intended se to be compact phone it just happened this way it was always parts bin offering and it stayed this way in as well yes its disappointment at this price but hey its an applel device and applel ios they make the rules they set the prices
Apple,iPhone 16e,this sounds just like galaxy fe just to get rid of remaining components that were acquired over previous years and were not entirely used
Apple,iPhone 16e,too generous of rating instead im actually in shock that they gave this below gsma must really really not like this phone
Apple,iPhone 16e,pathetic phone with hz screen
Apple,iPhone 16e,surprisingly poor battery life but anyway ok for many users
Apple,iPhone 16e,will give it stars
Apple,iPhone 16e,wow that is horrible value for money but im betting its going to sell okay due to being an iphone
Apple,iPhone 16e,not the brightest release especially from price standpoint id say would make it fine midrange but as positioned makes the regular more reasonable purchase but as the editor catches price hike is to be expected for the upcoming
Apple,iPhone 16e,deleted post ok fake reviewer and hater
Apple,iPhone 16e,would you not be better off buying new iphone for the same price
Apple,iPhone 16e,it will still sell like hot cakes people who just want the apple experience and refuse to buy more this will sell lesser than the mini phones this is disaster especially at that atrocious price tag
Apple,iPhone 16e,an ocean of alternatives at this price even in the us only the least informed apple fanatic would pay retail for this is worth getting in the review no you get variant maybe refurbed if you just must have an apple if noticed someone in real life had might think just little bit less of them sorry
Apple,iPhone 16e,the regular is better in every way than this phone you dont say
Apple,iPhone 16e,am the only one that sees the compare images tool everytime check the camera section
Apple,iPhone 16e,not that im defending this but do agree you guys should check out again your battery more yeah this doesnt match up with other tests ive seen that show much better life
Apple,iPhone 16e,two words better alternatives
Apple,iPhone 16e,im so sick of fans see no fan as an advantage but then gaming brands will try to even brin more not having fans is nice if you can manage your thermals properly without them if you cant then youre just making crap
Apple,iPhone 16e,baffling that they can release great value tablet and then this
Apple,iPhone 16e,if not the price it would be great phone for typical user
Apple,iPhone 16e,happens lot with reviews here saw it with other brands here too anyhow bit surprising more thats apple for you their macbook air has really awful thermals that get worse with every new gen if apple silicon because they skimp out on the cooling solution even the pro models have bad thermals because they prefer quiet operation over proper cooling not surprising that even with the twice downgraded chip they cant provide decent stability
Apple,iPhone 16e,really gud
Apple,iPhone 16e,it might not be good phone but you can enter apple world and change your life for the better more change your life for the betterits not good phoneyour words
Apple,iPhone 16e,waste for
Apple,iPhone 16e,why do gsmarena battery test differ so much than other reviewers
Apple,iPhone 16e,doubt it you can literally find for than money sure but for the average consumer that knows next to nothing about phones theyre going to buy the shiny new iphone over spite the latter being much better phone and for the folks that frequent these websites we are not the average consumer iphones already dominate market sales watch that increase when people can again buy shiny new iphone at an obtainable price stupid or not
Apple,iPhone 16e,this phone as successornext model from the se line would make perfect sense if cost and use the frame of iphone mini
Apple,iPhone 16e,who is this phone meant for who is going to buy this phone at this price
Apple,iPhone 16e,ahahahaha apple what are you doing ahaha please stahp the jokiest joke overjoked itself buy yourself last years galaxy su instead cheaper better longer battery life more functions its flagship after all
Apple,iPhone 16e,depends where you live in my country samsung didnt start dumping yet price wise so more think he is living in turkiye as am turkiye has heavy taxation on smartphones that doubles the price but some manufacturers like samsung is dumping prices for turkiye to cut the price of the phone for competition because if they give up like euros it means euros cheaper than rivals so gb is euros cheaper than gb at euros
Apple,iPhone 16e,frequency response graph all over the place lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,buy iphone pro max if you can find brand new one for gb not in turkiye mate cheapest pro max gb here is euros and it is grey market cheapest gb is euros also grey market pro gb is euros and pro max gb is euros the latest is my monthly income as an academician
Apple,iPhone 16e,ill have to disagree with gsmarenas battery life test techmos test and dav more even if you disagree with the battery tests that gsmarena have devised this phone is seriously overpriced no matter where you are here in the uk or over is joke hope people see sense and get either the regular or pro used or refurbished instead if you want their apple intelligence
Apple,iPhone 16e,phone for eur and it has main sensor you got to be kidding
Apple,iPhone 16e,for the price this phone sounds like good deal dont agree with gsmarenas more good price this is pounds mate for them money every other brand is offering lot more like really lot more even apple can give you more for them money if you shop around and grab pro max in more than good condition this device is several years behind when it comes to features
Apple,iPhone 16e,bwahahahahaha oh wooooow this turned out even worse than anticipated crap camera crap battery life crap display crap features crappiest price apple you really outappled yourselves with this one bravo
Apple,iPhone 16e,whats the point of this when even is cheaper whats the point of new lower price more can you talk without insulting someone
Apple,iPhone 16e,dang worse battery life than the regular iphone here when others have said its as good as the pros in other reviews
Apple,iPhone 16e,the phone for casuals that dont know what theyre buying anyway suspect it will sell well considering thats of the market
Apple,iPhone 16e,am surprise that gsm gives this such high score
Apple,iPhone 16e,not at all most consumers want simple and reliable not interested in specsthe average cons more doubt it you can literally find for than money
Apple,iPhone 16e,camera design straight from nexus
Apple,iPhone 16e,we know that many are describing the iphone as an iphone refresh probably because more in fact the back is where the most change happened the front is pretty much the same the frame has new button but the back has different camera bump different texture pretty much the only similar thing is the placement of the apple logo
Apple,iPhone 16e,battery life doesnt make sense
Apple,iPhone 16e,no fast charging no buy simple
Apple,iPhone 16e,heavily overpriced and underperforming despite larger battery it doesnt even match the scores of other iphones that must be low on quality perhaps thats why apple introduced an iphone to get rid of all the defective chips
Apple,iPhone 16e,the battery scores are quite disappointing despite bigger battery one less camera and that power efficient modem add to it the phone being way too overpriced hard pass
Apple,iPhone 16e,got me wondering too how is gsmarena so different think its because gsmarena uses airplane mode for most of the test the iphone has great battery life because of how efficient its modem is but since the phone isnt connected to cell network that doesnt show up in the test results
Apple,iPhone 16e,really weird how in other reviews the beats in battery life because more efficient mod more got me wondering too how is gsmarena so different
Apple,iPhone 16e,was expecting at least the same main camera as the iphone no point in getting this at all iphone is considerably better and the price difference is not really that great
Apple,iPhone 16e,wasnt this supposed to be the best battery life in inch smartphone
Apple,iPhone 16e,by today standard more than one hour of fully charging in unacceptable
Apple,iPhone 16e,so nobody chrcked the panel manifacturer
Apple,iPhone 16e,definitely expected great battery life especially with that hz screen but this is rly disappointing
Apple,iPhone 16e,nothing stands apart the camera is meh generic chinese smartphone might be better value for money
Apple,iPhone 16e,only exceptional active score battery life could have redeemed this device at this price point that is as things stand only revising the price of the gb version to and the other two accordingly can redeem iphone
Apple,iPhone 16e,you have score on dmark stress test st run looks like slight increase in temp reduces scores lot might have been the reason for your low score in the non stress test
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple has lost their mind right now in my country iphone costs the same as galaxy an more not at all most consumers want simple and reliable not interested in specsthe average consumers also loves pretty things this will sell extremely well
Apple,iPhone 16e,easily beats galaxy
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple made this phone to replace iphone and
Apple,iPhone 16e,hope comes with atleast inch scren inch good size but still not the best for for watching movies ir gaming
Apple,iPhone 16e,cute and nostalgic buy it
Apple,iPhone 16e,however completely notchless iphone may not arrive until as apple gradually integrates underdisplay technology
Apple,iPhone 16e,phoneandcarguy aug im thinking the same with an iphone but when im like becasue will already wok fo more im hoping that therell be no notch or punch hole just full screen which is what im used to and which may be the case with the pro models well have to wait and see
Apple,iPhone 16e,ill stay with my iphone plus for now but thanks for the suggestion im thinking about gett more im thinking the same with an iphone but when im like becasue will already wok for the money and idk what could be in the iphone next year maybe punchole if you click it it will be the dyaamic island
Apple,iPhone 16e,but the iphone smokes the in gaming and all other tests even with the binned it more at dollareuros or punds what ever just get like an iphone pro refurbed it literaly the same price but the pro is way better
Apple,iPhone 16e,diabolical just get android why is it still hz ill stay with my iphone plus for now but thanks for the suggestion im thinking about getting an iphone next year
Apple,iPhone 16e,theres good proc but for what it gives some battery life but ios so bloated its slow sluggish whatever proc you kick at they put that proc because its cheap for them its reuse you know even cheaper than making older boards and procs they reuse old screen old wide sensors and you pay tbe heavy price pretend its cheap apple always been like that though never liked them my teeens their apple ii for smart rich people they have not changed just can buy some of their stuff but their dna is same greed greed and greed if you rich wealthy then go for it otherwise its expensive hkrap might cost what or less at the factory output and there we dont even see those are why do they hide so much the workers ive an idea what they are cant tell here
Apple,iPhone 16e,clearly inforioer camera ive compared many pictures on photographer its hz its ok scroll on ios is bad wanting to look like fake real objects maybe theyll improve that in next ios hopefully then there are the low nits which may bothers me screen is the old one think ill go apple store tomorrow ask if can try phone outside in the sun few sec and also what theyd offer for rebuy my mini they are universally know to be bad at both those from slovakia to canada
Apple,iPhone 16e,for magsafe there are spigen and otterbox cases maybe that so the trick not sure never tried camera im puzzled not photographer at all but easily difference between good and ok and bad even in point and shot dont need zoom or fancy pro thingies still if is doing same for half price like smaller size and new releases ip and so on will all be bigger not fan of ios but android and all gafas software degraded lot last versions claimed dont be evvil and now they areand genz dont care so have to live with it kind of same sht in the end about os and software
Apple,iPhone 16e,ive doubt its same sensor as the pictures look dull techspurt says its on par with but hes apolehater and super harsh review so but thinking twice reading here and there and watching picture well they are review so reliability in dubious it seems true they save money on sensor so now dont know really dont like to be foooled like that at that price
Apple,iPhone 16e,magsafe is working magsafe is working with magnetic case cover no magsafe workaround with case is workaround and itll be still wireless charging at best no qi either magnetic ring not work they dont stuck dont stay in place sorry rain on tour parade just saying me ill live without wireless or magsafe with this phone excellent battery life no need to put always on wireless stand for charging wich is also fancy workaround because of bad apples battery life but this phone is good at battery
Apple,iPhone 16e,bigger battery but one camera worth the tradeoff guess it makes great elderly phone or just for guy who needs phone and is familiar with using ios
Apple,iPhone 16e,read it has no magsafe at first thought magsafe was ridiculous apple fanboy thing then bought one and started to like those gadgetery but because it was iphone mini needed to be always charging and magsafe was good workaround for chatting often and those fancy useless widgets so can live without that gadgetery as its usb and battery last very long switching to ios thought id never do that but abdroid become worse and worse spyi bloaty dont be evyl if you remember and ios slowly improving itll never be open thigh its apples dna and business remember appletalk its not new to them
Apple,iPhone 16e,at first hatted that phone come from mostly android thinking twice battery is great web browsing is what really matters for me awesome camera best for that phone size relatively small size can get resale of my mini start to get used to ios dont like walled garden and all anyances but the fast is ios improve slowly where as droid keep eshyrification sorry android bybye stunning proc expensive but im quite sure thatll last stopped bykng lowmid range they didnt lastw just the screen protection by itself some fast soft brick well and bit too much but still moto too many bloatspy poco has usb port literally burnt and so on so what thought was terrible end the perfect one for me especially considering they will end those relatively small form factors both samsung and apple
Apple,iPhone 16e,no it doesnt can your elite run aaa games it cant can your elite run zzz more lol playing games on tiny screen
Apple,iPhone 16e,in this price can purchase gb ram internal this iphone no match for iphone is totally scrap worst product in comparison to android spicaly vivo
Apple,iPhone 16e,bye bye im finish with apple and another oems crap today buy pixel black wow wh more can say that my plus is beauty too its phablet but my last phone plus which was also my first iphone was too so im used to it theres bigger phones than the plus these days hope the next iphone get maybe an iphone isnt too much bigger or heavier though because carry them around in my pockets
Apple,iPhone 16e,in practice sd elite outperforms little bit no it doesnt can your elite run aaa games it cant can your elite run zzz genshin impact at fps no it cant apple phones can
Apple,iPhone 16e,phoneandcarguy aug just checked what is better the iphone or the samsung an dont waste your money more but the iphone smokes the in gaming and all other tests even with the binned it is still approximately times faster in raw performance than elite inside that also includes the dimensity the iphone chip still beats them without problem
Apple,iPhone 16e,just checked what is better the iphone or the samsung an dont waste your money on this only if you like apple buy this but if you care more about the specsperformance or gaming choose the over the
Apple,iPhone 16e,this is mobile model is really dumb because interior shows how much good it will be learn to speak english bro
Apple,iPhone 16e,the htc dream which is phone from has autofocus so it stands to reason that the only ph more so some phones cameras dont have autofocus at all can understand turning af off to be able to manually focus particular photo but to not have af at all
Apple,iPhone 16e,autofocus dont all phones cameras already have this the htc dream which is phone from has autofocus so it stands to reason that the only phones which lack autofocus are featuredumb phones
Apple,iPhone 16e,mah bigger battery and modem thats why you dont get it its gsmarena who said that has better battery life than the modem and the larger battery
Apple,iPhone 16e,if you live in the nordics you can get this phone for under eur says expensive
Apple,iPhone 16e,the first iphone comes with apple modem by the way the modem doesnt support mmwave though ill wait till in the iphone think
Apple,iPhone 16e,will there be af on autofocus dont all phones cameras already have this
Apple,iPhone 16e,gsmarena how come everybody in the world experiences longer battery life on than on an more mah bigger battery and modem thats why
Apple,iPhone 16e,system on chip thanks do you know what an af is
Apple,iPhone 16e,what is soc system on chip
Apple,iPhone 16e,the soc alone of iphone the reson to buy its even more powerful than sd wlite of more what is soc
Apple,iPhone 16e,cons notch that belongs in only nits nits peak screen brightness pretty abysmal camera is meh only gb memory max config no wifi usb back in again depressingly slow charing speeds rather small battery half baked ai features that are borderline useless cad msrp in the gb variant apple is this joke pros none verdict dont
Apple,iPhone 16e,iphone xr ahh design more like se
Apple,iPhone 16e,you forgot dynamic island if use does not need dynamic island also then yeah can buy more and yeah wait till one plus send you wrong update to brick your one plus after years of use lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,why did they even release this whos gonna buy one camera phone with mah battery more the soc alone of iphone the reson to buy its even more powerful than sd wlite of ultra lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,get the pro if you just want cheap but powerful upgrade the iphone has slower wirele more pro and pro max actillay more expensive used than
Apple,iPhone 16e,hes just mocking ios theres no ios after is
Apple,iPhone 16e,totally with you on that the plus body had such great balancebig screen touch id and more your wish was partially granted because iphone has camera from iphone
Apple,iPhone 16e,huh if youve got android on your iphone then its not real iphone dont think its po more hes just mocking ios
Apple,iPhone 16e,work for mobile carrier in the us and we sell more than any other model the idea that more the first iphone comes with apple modem by the way
Apple,iPhone 16e,ios is slowly looking more and more like an android skin there said it you mean android that looking like ios lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,available in all your dogs favorite colors apple has really gone bland with colors on everything but the and think thats how they get nontechy people to buy them
Apple,iPhone 16e,after update my ios become android os system why ios is slowly looking more and more like an android skin there said it
Apple,iPhone 16e,how to do smileys let me test edit ok know now
Apple,iPhone 16e,is good phonebut you should put night vission camera
Apple,iPhone 16e,are you kidding work for mobile carrier and we sell the shieza out of these it was article on this site about that and no dont kidding just follow more news here
Apple,iPhone 16e,nobody that why it has lower sales numbers than se which also has terrible results at lea more are you kidding work for mobile carrier and we sell the shieza out of these
Apple,iPhone 16e,had the iphone its great for what it offers fast overall including internet speed great camera good battery handle games well etc only reason switch to the pro max was because was small for my hands and need the full pro camera features due to work most people dont need this so if you dont mind the size and dont need all these camera features like in the pro models then you will love this phone should be priced at though
Apple,iPhone 16e,soon to be renamed vista se lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,no clue where the hell my question went so ill retype it again have an iphone xr and more get the pro if you just want cheap but powerful upgrade the iphone has slower wireless charging speeds only one camera which is actually decent but theres no ultrawide hz refresh rate and might be wrong this phone has no magsafe only get the if you only care about making phone calls streaming movies and using social media like tiktok and instagram im still using my samsung galaxy note after five years and think the iphone is slightly overpriced for phone with these features im personally waiting until the price drops for the iphone so that can switch back to iphone
Apple,iPhone 16e,ive got one and im happy with it not everyone cares stupid second camera dont even use stupid instagram and tiktok one camera is enough for me that one camera does good job too also battery is awesome
Apple,iPhone 16e,ah have as work phone and is forced to upgrade every years and the new phone is gonna be this crap its inferior in some places like no magsafe and inferior wireless charging and one camera all that use regularly today that wide camera comes in handy lot at work what
Apple,iPhone 16e,have got one for its really good phone for this price and battery is awesome am happy with it
Apple,iPhone 16e,if they use the ultrawide camera from iphone pro with different lens as the main camera why not use the same sensor as the selfie camera for an ultrawide on future its sensor so worse than the ultrawide from iphone its currently in production and should cost next to nothing considering thats the same size as the redmi main camera but phone with no ultrawide at all thats though sell even though the soc is better than any other android phone
Apple,iPhone 16e,all amoled appong will green line someday fuk appong is luxury scam crap like those tariffs apple has no green lime only droids as hawt
Apple,iPhone 16e,bruh my samsung costs half as much as this yet it still has hz screen and chargin more yes but youll get fluid experience lasts yrs samsung botched one ui lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,bought mine few days ago euro in europe new with warranty with silicon case and screen pro more nice photos good looks good
Apple,iPhone 16e,my dear friend can you tell me one single feature in pro which is considered better univer more you forgot dynamic island if use does not need dynamic island also then yeah can buy though if user just buy pro user will get everything better why would someone lose these features if can have these if price is the concern should buy oneplus same price range flagship device note use pm
Apple,iPhone 16e,second hand pro my comments were in response to this one
Apple,iPhone 16e,my daughter in canada bought this phone she said it cost her about coming from an iphone se she says this phone is much better the battery is great and shes very happy with her purchase
Apple,iPhone 16e,using the galaxy to point out another phones bad value is definitely choice mean more dont understand your point yes using another phone to point out is indeed choice which is kind of stating the obvious the is bad value but im not sure why its being brought up when was comparing the to the call bs on you getting the iphone se for no way you bought it for so little unless it was in very poor condition or the seller you got it from is an idiot
Apple,iPhone 16e,oh ok so why dont the iphones just draw the whole time to charge the battery because apple are bunch of condescending aholes who treat their users like babies and to keep said users locked down in their own walled garden seriously have no idea why apple doesnt allow iphones to have fast charging toggled on or off at will its not that complicated
Apple,iPhone 16e,in the article you sourced there is section of the page called phone can charge fa more oh ok so why dont the iphones just draw the whole time to charge the battery
Apple,iPhone 16e,oh wow thats actually interesting only the plus and pro max models can charge so more could you please explain the charging power tops to on all models if something heavy is running ive not heard of that
Apple,iPhone 16e,no problem youre forgiven iphones dont yet have super fast charging capabilities like some more oh wow thats actually interesting only the plus and pro max models can charge somewhat fast unlike the pro and the weird move by apple especially because the charging power tops to on all models if something heavy is running
Apple,iPhone 16e,stop making excuses for being lazy there was clearly wireless icon next to the text whic more which means youre offended because you were called out on your hasty assumption tbh think you might be the only one actually upset here it was just small misunderstanding and the other person already owned up to it as somebody else had pointed it out to him no need to turn it into an argument its not that deep yeah sure watts cable charging went extinct by and is insanely slow even by todays standards and yeah it would be dumb of one to assume that the iphone charged at watts through cable honestly dont know where this assumption came from but if had to guess it could be from the watt charging bricks apple shipped with their phones in the box from the iphone to the base model only which was slow for newer phones as it would charge the phone slower as the battery got bigger each generation either way at the end of the day it was just misunderstanding there is zero point dragging it out youre essentially making yourself look like youre starting drama over nothing
Apple,iPhone 16e,yeah youre right that was mistake on my end is actually logical for wireless char more no problem youre forgiven iphones dont yet have super fast charging capabilities like some androids do below are the max charging speeds for the iphone iphone iphone pro iphone plus to iphone pro max to source httpswwwphonearenacomnewsnoiphonenotchargingfasterid
Apple,iPhone 16e,the charging shown here is for wireless charging think not wired charging agree with more yeah youre right that was mistake on my end is actually logical for wireless charging since the google pixel and the iphone se and have the same wireless charging speed wireless charging is alright but of wired charging for the price alone is awful
Apple,iPhone 16e,people here like most people on the internet lack reading comprehension skills and fail to more oh my god relax its not that deep not lot of people look through the specifications of the phone correctly which is what has most likely happened here the wired charging speed isnt displayed on here unlike the wireless charging speed which the person most likely overlooked but still these charging speeds and considering the fact that dollars is the bare minimum price of this phone is unlawful bad investing in mint condition iphone pro is better than this budget phone
Apple,iPhone 16e,for gb brand new this isnt price of budget phone bruh if they added or more the charging shown here is for wireless charging think not wired charging agree with you though
Apple,iPhone 16e,they make this shit to increase iphone sale
Apple,iPhone 16e,wow innovation this apple is full of sht your phone doesnt even connect to wifi so picky doesnt share file with computer or other android phones whats the phone if apple keep postings new phone but the camera is what they are proud of
Apple,iPhone 16e,in my opinion just add an extra bucks and go for iphone pro hz triple camera and have decent processor
Apple,iPhone 16e,even most mid range and budget samsungs have or hz for half or less the price of this the only thing that doesnt make this overpriced is the cpu im guessing the stands for ewaste
Apple,iPhone 16e,no ones dropping grand on this ancient underwhelming piece of tech seriously have no idea what apple was thinking with this phoneit felt outdated the moment it dropped youd have to be out of your mind to buy it no matter the situation there are so many better phones out there even older iphones that do way more for way less and honestly even if money isnt an issue theres just nothing about this phone that makes you actually want it the price bracket they shoved it into is straightup ridiculous sorry apple but nahwere just gonna pretend this one never happened oh and please enough with the usbc ports already come on
Apple,iPhone 16e,my own plus should upgrade to this its up to you but im staying with my plus red gb for now ive been using it for years now and im still quite happy with it today dont need an upgrade yet and cant really afford one at the moment either im thinking of waiting till they get rid of the notch that might happen next year with the although the and pro models have the dynamic island feature so well see
Apple,iPhone 16e,for this single camera watts of charging it doesnt even include charger more it has of wireless charging you can tell by the icon to the left it it the regular charging speed is probably going to be around like the se rd generation which is still quite atrocious for
Apple,iPhone 16e,only for tb ultra how traded in my mint condition ultra gb and then samsung gave me off on the trade in and then gave me another off bringing it to or after tax
Apple,iPhone 16e,yes excellent choice have iphone have iphone and am very happy with it
Apple,iPhone 16e,definitely very budget
Apple,iPhone 16e,sar in percent higher then other series this is microwave
Apple,iPhone 16e,average user look at pixel also bigger screen slightly guess you have to still like ios regardless if battery ok
Apple,iPhone 16e,actually you know what no magsafe dont care use wired charging gpu cores instead of not that much less no dynamic island dont care actually quite like the notch and the fact that theres no ultrawide camera is probably the biggest downgrade but overall its cheaper so wouldnt call the lack of an ultrawide to be big problem
Apple,iPhone 16e,the phone costs here in the uk when bought full price directly from apple but for just more here month cheap might get it as spare before trump import tax
Apple,iPhone 16e,for alternative choice besides iphone it will be great choice
Apple,iPhone 16e,its like iphone plusextra large black border screen
Apple,iPhone 16e,still the is more innovative with apple intelligence and modem lel show me that innovative side pls
Apple,iPhone 16e,im so confused which one should buy any suggestions iphone and iphone has the more second hand pro
Apple,iPhone 16e,were can get the unlocked us version of this iphone this would good phone for my mother to use was able to buy the galaxy ultra unlocked version online straight from samsung without cellular plan so why cant buy an unlocked iphone without cellular plan
Apple,iPhone 16e,not why are people buying the iphone and because there are lots of peo more you are right but know some people who sold their android with hz to buy this phone with hz why didnt they care about loosing the hz and like said you should test it and find out for yourself dont jump into conclusions
Apple,iPhone 16e,every review ive seen on the has said the battery life was very good and better than more not the first time gsmarena gets battery test wrong am grateful for this website as its very convenient to look up specs but they could put more effort in their reviews
Apple,iPhone 16e,on ytuber technick he did iphone and other androids battery test resulting ipe last ho more every review ive seen on the has said the battery life was very good and better than the regular iphone so the gsmarena test is surprising
Apple,iPhone 16e,what like to do is install the draw anything extension and then fix the phones specs and prices
Apple,iPhone 16e,dollars no ultrawide in power of half eaten fruit ship
Apple,iPhone 16e,he is right hz on ios is better than hz on some androids if not why are people buying th more not why are people buying the iphone and because there are lots of people buying popular things for no reason at all its like fashion to buy fancy products
Apple,iPhone 16e,ive relied on gsmarena for years but this battery test result for the iphone seems off more realworld usage if you have why should you care about tests you know that different people different apps network coverage settings in general can have impact on battery
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple you here pixel for apple you listening same processor like flagship bigger battery great display same software ai shenanigans like flagship pro xl hz refreshrate oled display great camera setup just like last year apple you here fanboys you here thats how budget device must like apple
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple once again reveals that their only functioning department besides logistics is marketing more on ytuber technick he did iphone and other androids battery test resulting ipe last hours longer than su dont believe his test by the way since all of his battery test its always iphone wins
Apple,iPhone 16e,just glorified iphone smh
Apple,iPhone 16e,is this supposed to be compact this is the same as normal screen height
Apple,iPhone 16e,paid usd directly from samsung for the unlocked galaxy ultra tb model besides the more only for tb ultra how
Apple,iPhone 16e,this retails for about in my country while the vanilla iphone costs the same or lesser more paid usd directly from samsung for the unlocked galaxy ultra tb model besides the ultra is way better smarphone than the iphone will ever be
Apple,iPhone 16e,updated iphone xr xr was the best
Apple,iPhone 16e,better options iqoo
Apple,iPhone 16e,cope comparing my ancient year old note plus to even the pro version of this ewaste phone litterally on this site objectively proves you wrong you have to be trump worshipper youre so delusional
Apple,iPhone 16e,battery level sucks was expecting better results tbh for an your full of nonsense
Apple,iPhone 16e,best product this phone is absolute overpriced garbage none of the existing manufacturers have produced anything better and more durable than the iphone at price of
Apple,iPhone 16e,do you see that notch that forehead that big fat black thing there is nothing look more show me phone from the year with notch on screen compare it with iphone se enjoy your android redmi while commenting an iphone because they are both phones so they should compare like that right right damir neverind that android is free and we can use it everywhere even in our fridge ah yes lets compare two different operating systems like they are the same lets sing and rejoice people its time to bash apple slow charger nothing in the box ugly old design how can anyone buy apple instead of xiaomi or some other ultra affordable phone are you all just snobs buying because of apple logo sure man sure this is the cheapest phone for entering in ios eco system why do you tryimg to compare it with other androud phones to better suit your narrative we get it you dont like ios and thats fine if you said something about this phone and compare it with pro for the same price then that would make lot of sense but this comparing android phones which have zillion of different brands and models apples with its is not fair why not comparing apples with apples we are talking about preference which one is better android or ios depends on you and what do you like more know you dont understand what have said because most people see just two phones they dont take into account that is not just two phones lile comparing two different android phones apple is different and the only fair comparision with every of their model are their own models this phone should not cost this much thas for sure but to be compared with android is on another level of being ignorant or purposly living in you own echo chamber thats my opinion not fact nothing but just my very not popular opinion lol have great day phone lovers
Apple,iPhone 16e,getting wanker tattooed on your forehead will cost you considerably less than buyi more might be better spend last longer
Apple,iPhone 16e,apples best products always have lot of haters best product this phone is absolute overpriced garbage
Apple,iPhone 16e,basically apples attempt at remaking iphone xr
Apple,iPhone 16e,latest iphone greatest scam
Apple,iPhone 16e,was really thinking about changing to ios but after saw what they done with this phone screw them really at this point dont have to buy phone with all these sacrifices just to enter into the apple ecosystem
Apple,iPhone 16e,wait it actually has mah battery wth with one more less gpu cores and several other essentials cut down in the connectivity department this should perform better than the normal and yes its not necessarily good thing and doesnt make it any better than other companies competition im just saying that was surprised that apple actually manages to fit similarly sized battery as the in the but not at the normal probably because it have other things such as an ultrawide which might compromised space but again other smartphone makers already used sc battery
Apple,iPhone 16e,the worst possible apple product the redmi performs much better have been using apple products since the launch of ipods in india have never come across such disappointing apple product
Apple,iPhone 16e,since this iphone is out my iphone is not charging anymore does anyone experiencing the same think this is anothe trick from apple to force people to buy new phones
Apple,iPhone 16e,for think its trash
Apple,iPhone 16e,wonder about the connectivity with the new apple modem the phones basically for real life testing this modem so they can improve it for the next iphone series
Apple,iPhone 16e,is even better than the in all terms not in term of power tho
Apple,iPhone 16e,tldr battery life is poor due to new modem being inefficient and old screen being ineffi more we have to wait for more tests so far there are not many but the recent one on youtube has shown is on par with vanilla so while it didnt show as much difference as gsmarena test it is still not that good considering its got bigger battery then vanilla and yet perforfms about the same
Apple,iPhone 16e,dat screen brightness tho
Apple,iPhone 16e,its phone at best it should have been priced in that range at this point secondhand iphone pro is much better choice than this iphone experimental model
Apple,iPhone 16e,not all iphones are bad but this is hell mp camera in didnt think they would even bring back the notch too
Apple,iPhone 16e,people will always have reason to complain about iphones just like the iphone which has hz the iphone has high price but people will still buy this phone just like they bought the iphone because apple will always give you reason to buy their product my elder sister has this phone and its solid phone know you can get better phonemaybe used iphone pro for the same price but if you can ignore the price and buy this phone you wont regret it as for me cant buy it im happy with my iphone
Apple,iPhone 16e,overpriced buy an iphone instead of this junk
Apple,iPhone 16e,hz really we need hz for extra innovation and cinematic experience
Apple,iPhone 16e,all phone review websites and tech youtubers just reviewed this and confirmed that this phone is bad joke but even after all that here come army of trolls to shill for apple and defend it it will sell like hot cakes great phone great budget phone just some of the comments here unbelievable total brain rot
Apple,iPhone 16e,wish that apple will start sellin lite version of this in my dreams there would be iphone lite yes its terrible name that costs under it would be great having iphone xr body with the usb and mp camera and all the other parts from the iphone xr
Apple,iPhone 16e,its neither compact nor cheap nor good why would you buy this instead of an iphone pro
Apple,iPhone 16e,gb no card slot and core graphics for no way
Apple,iPhone 16e,ancient product at future price
Apple,iPhone 16e,im going to apple store right now buying three of these bro can get the iphone pro refurbished with better features
Apple,iPhone 16e,copying the previous model is called innovation something android cant do uh huhh yea
Apple,iPhone 16e,phone from ahahahahdhdhshshshshshshshs
Apple,iPhone 16e,rational person knows that the iphone is completely worthless compared to the pro but apple has mocked the rational person by introducing the iphone and the way it is priced this is what big companies do keep consumer expectations low and we do nothing we cant do anything because we have entrusted our intellect and intelligence to these companies
Apple,iPhone 16e,if this had magsafe id be pissed thank god it aint got it still think the is better
Apple,iPhone 16e,there is very low difference with iphone and iphone xr both are same model but xr have ba more are you seriously comparing phone that has no software support worse display less ram and worse battery life to this
Apple,iPhone 16e,this phone has the same price as iphone in my country despite being years old it is still far superior price makes no sense
Apple,iPhone 16e,you cant be serious budget phone should not have flagship price like mo more see thats the most common answer dont blame you for not seeing what the guy actually said he said if you want an iphone thats crucial bit with people buying android phones they just dont get it in most cases people think its just status simbol sure and it is but not just that with you mentioned an android phone as better buy think you dont understand the main difference between phones which is this case is ios the main operating system which is different then the ol and free android which is again freee and we can have it on everything from tosters to cars and tvs not the same story with apple products again neverending debate with apple vs android phones lol this is phone for people wanting an ios why is there so much people from android world because they are ignoring fhe sowftware side since forever am using both an android and ios and they both suck in some areas and are great in some others so make your own choice and if yall dont understand something you cam always type in favorite search browser but its easier to mock somethin and be sarcastic about it because people dont want to understand know know lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,yes hour delaying never and to be honest is random not constantly and if you told tha more you think people with thinking hmmm what mid range phone could buy oh look an old iphone pro or great not on par with specs on android phones but who cares right because the only thing matter is the price which in thier range so well no people usually buying these lowered priced iphones as the cheapest way to get into ios ecosystem or because they already are there just want to get the newer model the issue is that this phone is too expensive for all of the above mentioned categories we can talk about inflation and all that but others have the same problem so theres not much excuses left for apple people have always been baffled with iphone users and fans because even blind man can see the difference in numbers right rightbecause numbers in two different systems are so much accurate sorry for the sarcasm lol but its not that simple as black and white this debate will never be over ill just say this if you want to understand about something you will give your best android or ios is choice if you want an android plenty of choices if you want ios not many choices and this is the lowest priced one its nit meant to battle with other similar priced android phones lol anyways have great day everyone
Apple,iPhone 16e,even the cheaper samsung aa are using larger sensor than the sensor size is not all there is to it lol you can find camera comparison between the ae which clearly shows latter doing bettermore detailed shots in every possible light condition also if you like samsung or any other phone why bother coming here to whine just use it proudly and be happy the obsession to come at iphone is hilarious tbh
Apple,iPhone 16e,how would apple explain the fact they didnt use sensorshift ois in the since it was implemented in the pro max almost years ago
Apple,iPhone 16e,watts for charging is crazy and we in its wireless charging smart pants
Apple,iPhone 16e,what amaze me about is the battery
Apple,iPhone 16e,tiniest rear camera on any phone above is insane even the cheaper samsung aa are using larger sensor than the
Apple,iPhone 16e,overpriced sorry
Apple,iPhone 16e,just check the video of sillycorns on yt about this phone says it all
Apple,iPhone 16e,if on budget do not buy this phone why price vs features is lacking if buying the apple do not buy this phone why you telling others you lack of money and fail financially in thinking if defending apple do not defend this phone why it shows instead of providing the best in each tier apple is cost cutting and tell you what you need instead of listening
Apple,iPhone 16e,the perfect phone without lagging without hiccups no notification delays just an uncomprom more perfect you could have got older model with better specs like pro max
Apple,iPhone 16e,what makes you think im proud faker who has used all kinds of phones in my imagination more alright bro good night
Apple,iPhone 16e,another proud user who has used all kinds of smartphones in his imagination good lord how ma more what makes you think im proud faker who has used all kinds of phones in my imagination simply wanted to call you out on your bs about xiaomi getting lots of negative reviews and doing much worse than vivo and realme because its just not true

Apple,iPhone 16e,looking at people fighting each other about any brand is hillarious
Apple,iPhone 16e,you are telling there is no notfications delay with android if you do then you are just more yes hour delaying never and to be honest is random not constantly and if you told that ios is bug free then youre lying but we talking about how apple sells poor products on higher price tell me one thing where this hilarious iphone is better compared to xiaomi for example to cost more money display camera battery design ai lets looking objectively on the things understand that apple fanboys are easily vulnerable on this topic but we have to be realistic this particular model is extremely overpriced and you have to be totally blind to invest your money in it
Apple,iPhone 16e,and whats this nonsense about xiaomi doing horrible these days and getting lots of negat more another proud user who has used all kinds of smartphones in his imagination good lord how many fake shit we got here gsmarena
Apple,iPhone 16e,bla bla bla same old antiapple shit and then you realise that sb sent you message in more we speak about technical factsif you contest be as precise as we are youre answer is bla bla bla what an sharp argument ignorant hasnt argument and is easier to be fooled but its easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled mark twain

Apple,iPhone 16e,bohemia mar hz screen in is like walking aroud unearthed without the priest knowing oh my goshso scary
Apple,iPhone 16e,youre fooled by logo you see an apple you think its better not only appl more dont cry

Apple,iPhone 16e,its pretty easy to complain and whine if you havent actually seen and compared these devices more youre fooled by logo you see an apple you think its better not only apple buy cheapest technologies but doesnt pay related licences too its the same with the cheap wifi on iphone pro max httpsyoutubecomshortsjayepdlcdaisidpnwsmtjxebntqd is this quality youre just fooled and as youre an apple fan you will say you dont need this wifi speed yes but apple sold wifi you paid it high price apple bought hardware from cheap provider to maximise profits and didnt give you the promised performances you defend this its stockholm syndrome
Apple,iPhone 16e,stop talking shit the phone is typical iphone with all the bells and whistles no magsafe more your comment simply justifies that you are very unhappy with your choice of purchasing iphone now venting out your frustration here by defending the product silly you
Apple,iPhone 16e,there are phones that are bad but this one stands on top
Apple,iPhone 16e,yup never gonna buy american products again after oval office meeting too bad theres no alternative for pcs maybe armbased or something
Apple,iPhone 16e,lmao usb and anyone are fine about it meanwhile it is android anyone will put their finest complaint
Apple,iPhone 16e,eat that overpriced and noob specifications you afflers slave hahhahah
Apple,iPhone 16e,why is nobody talking about the most crappiest camera sensor they used
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple cmooon poor display poor battery poor camera poor everything for just look more the display is better than galaxy
Apple,iPhone 16e,lol definitely not budget chipset is up there among one of the best chipset currently more its not budget chipset but remember gpu wise pro and its cores are close to last years dgen with cores im not even sure this light beats the on poco pro
Apple,iPhone 16e,iphone ewaste
Apple,iPhone 16e,the price starts with euros in my country paid plan on straight talk website only have pay month service for days unlock after activation since its verizon
Apple,iPhone 16e,biggest downfall is the dark screen about the same nits as iphone and no magsafe
Apple,iPhone 16e,take battery capacity here httpsyoutubeyxmnibxttfat
Apple,iPhone 16e,whats the geekbench result
Apple,iPhone 16e,really eye of rah
Apple,iPhone 16e,battery capacity is officially bigger than galaxy galaxy rated capacity mah more now its even more official that it has android makers would market it as nicemah
Apple,iPhone 16e,no magsafe no dear sir it does not have the magnets and its at
Apple,iPhone 16e,iphone has small sensor size from years ego when sensor is small cant take lightthe mp aperture and night mode can not help small sensor to see in the dark even dumb people can say that has small eye on the back compared to eyes
Apple,iPhone 16e,charging speed
Apple,iPhone 16e,no magsafe
Apple,iPhone 16e,ok so youre comparing budget phone chipset with flagship android chipset this smok more for is not budget its upper midrange why are you being so disingenuous plus the oneplus is the same price for gb and it is the same or better in all performance categories
Apple,iPhone 16e,its actually mah as same as said on at gsmarenacom got it at
Apple,iPhone 16e,the diagonal for this sensor is mm even the poco pro has bigger sensor mm apple
Apple,iPhone 16e,
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple copy his own phone iphone and se gg
Apple,iPhone 16e,is the future
Apple,iPhone 16e,that single camera is enough to destroy most of the phones in its segment but other than that more yeah it destroys but in camera performance not good looks lookwise its an eyesore mobile cover with more faux cameras that dont work can enhance its looks
Apple,iPhone 16e,suspect that sect will soon form that will explain why it is completely normal and acceptable for small one camera gb phone with bathtub in the screen to cost
Apple,iPhone 16e,extra for additional memory internal is scam
Apple,iPhone 16e,even budget android phone could run spotify and youtube just fine why would you waste suc more name name it could be gb ppl still pay it buy it in year when its
Apple,iPhone 16e,yes even my android does lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,the camera looks goofy
Apple,iPhone 16e,the single camera killed itplus its too expensivethe single camera is nothing great too judging from samples
Apple,iPhone 16e,the performance of this iphone is poor it only has gpu cores even the performance of the more ok so youre comparing budget phone chipset with flagship android chipset this smokes everything in its price range when it comes to performance
Apple,iPhone 16e,lol bro no compere to this android phone on this phone is trash just core gpu even on iphone basic cannot reached dimensity and snapdragon elite performance
Apple,iPhone 16e,hi guys does this phone have nfc and support apply pay yes
Apple,iPhone 16e,biggest piece of trash bro you can get vivo with that price tag lol bro no compere to this android phone
Apple,iPhone 16e,it is another flop after iphone who are the target audience iphone is better value than this
Apple,iPhone 16e,guess iphone with just only usbc can support display port just like ipad entry level which also uses usbc meanwhile most android phones with usbc does not support display port but requires usbc and above
Apple,iPhone 16e,very bad mistake to downgrade from to usb bc usb dont support display output this is no more profetional phone its like cheap android from and guess what for its price its fcked up
Apple,iPhone 16e,charging in
Apple,iPhone 16e,iphone experimental this product will have advantages in software this price is focu more no no no we should call it ewaste
Apple,iPhone 16e,its really good play gta and it run smoothly even helio can run gta unless if you mean definitive edition from netflix
Apple,iPhone 16e,they do lie in bed with them though bruh
Apple,iPhone 16e,its amazing phone can run spotify and youtube without issues camera is suberb even budget android phone could run spotify and youtube just fine why would you waste such money for that reason lol
Apple,iPhone 16e,apple isnt chinese dear sir they do lie in bed with them though
Apple,iPhone 16e,hopefully yes dont think so im getting one it reminds me of my xr and dont care if its hz or it has only one camera as far as it has night mode cant careless my xr was one of the best phone had back then and thats why love the iphone good battery new chip so id use it for abother years and
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),wish you guys would consider the old db levels at least for ring tone and loudspeaker levels this new method isnt practical for those very important need to know items imo thanks
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),works well to me and love its shape very sad about phones nowadats bad shape for hands more only complain is idle battery drain drain like for hours at night too much apple forcing bluetooth scan for their smart devices tags and sht even you disable bt also suspect wideband network management scan is bad otherwise battery is perfectly fine if not stuck all day on phone if relevant for anyone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),very fast gaming device works well to me and love its shape very sad about phones nowadats bad shape for hands heavey fragile and ugly use it with care sure wont spend hours browsing or gaming small battery and tiny display am happy lowering my usage in the end was browsing and doodling around too much with phone using it oustide at home maps commuting little browsing textmessaging apps perfect few hours day of use and no more no problem also configure it carefully disable as much as cloud and backgroup siri and gps and stuff as you can do that with any phone in my mindset its like having all the lights on at home when you leave paying and drawing co for nothing
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),have itbut charge it with xiami wat adapter and mfi certified cablehowever it takes more if you have enabled optimized battery charging the charging speed slowed down dramatically after try disabling optimized battery charging and see if that improve your charging time
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),ferrari engine with gas tank from fiat very fast gaming device
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),bought my se second hand in april and had freezing issues that nobody could figure out and last july after software update the hotspot feature quit working so phoned my carrier and they couldnt help and upped my rate by so cancelled realized apple dropped support for older wifi versions and now only supports wifi phoned apple but things are still the same the carrier contacted me last nov with an offer for savings so accepted and with the new sim card the freezing issue totally stopped found there are now wifi adapters that support all versions that say usb so dont know if the cost may be waste on my older usb laptop
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),after update vibration stops working on my se phone tried changing all the options more turn on vibrate on silent in sound and haptics
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),oh my goodness this iphone is terrible this other iphone is so much better in compariso more yeah apple gave this phone the battery capacity the iphone had but why not the im little bit confused
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),those portrait photos samples are perfect miss that model
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the bezels and battery life remain big joke and disappointment thanks god my boss didn more oh my goodness this iphone is terrible this other iphone is so much better in comparison so everybody should buy this other iphone notice how you consider apple as your only option when it isnt
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),please give suggestion on should use iphone back cover is it prone to slip you should definitely use one because one drop and the back will most likely be cracked and if that happens you cant easily repair it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),buy this phone yesterday refurbish condition think cause the rear and front camera abnormal also touch id may be changed when check on utools so far the performance is very well playing gamepes cm work smoothly charging fast with watt fast charge the battery drain fast when gaming beside that think it still hold up day time charge if you just use for daily task like chatphone calls and hour gaming
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),hi thanks for the wonderful review just comment on low light photos you day but for single ycan only do so much please explainis there any phone that other cameras helping the main with liw light sure not and am sure you are also tired reviewing midranges with tone of useless cameras
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),have also experienced the phone heating up and connectivity issues store representative off more there is none of heat sink is it getting hot more when you use it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),dynamic range but single camera can do only so much portraitbut ok for single camera device what thus has to do with dynamic range or even with portrait mode which you know doesnt need the fake depth sensor just observed that statement complaint about using single camera while we all know you neither like the fake sensors especially when you have in mind google pixel maan give some positive feedback to courage them do you prefer useless cameras on midrange phone and then complaint about having fake useless sensors just for specs common with love speak and you will never read it anyway
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),to be clear the iphone se cant do portrait mode on any subject like the others because more actually now every brand are using ai potrait instead of secondary lens it relies on bionic chip to make potrait possible
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),does anybody know if the iphone se has connection so you can plug earphones in to it more from the iphone on up they no longer have separate earphone jack but you can buy splitter dongle that will allow you to be hooked up to charger and use your earphones simultaneously
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),since its small display the resoloution and pixel density is quite decent id ra more like always great lcd is better than low or mediocre oled oled is the hype now among some other features but personally would still prefer top lcd to mediocre oled but yeah the resolution has to be good enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),its pretty impressive the battery can last that long with such little capacity ive used samsungs with and mah batteries and even though they last day or two with medium use in the first six months or so they lose capacity rapidly as even though they had high capacity like mah they arent as higher quality as you see on more expensive models like the flagships which boast good battery life without extreme capacities
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),why low battery life ive read post of other phone with about mah up bu could someone enlighten me on this please
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),yall complaining about small screen and im here with an original se when you grow up to more this is the best comment
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),however display and battery life is just garbage display on inch phone is like display on inch phone not the best but good enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),now im sitting here with an iphone se everyone thinks its great and more however display and battery life is just garbage
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),no one oh them were working one speaker is under device right speaker holes and one spea more no they are both used as stereo have the phone with my and both are used in music and video
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),iphone se have two speaker under is there two speaker were working the one on the left is the microphone and the one on the right is speaker
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),prefer having bezels myself with my mi keep accidentally touching controls when reaching for something else on the screen im also worried that with tiny bezels the screen is more exposed to damage if dropped putting on beefy case kinda defeats the purpose of getting such slim phone in the first place right
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),want to buy an iphonewhich one is best the or the se think you know the answer to that really
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),phone se having two grills below but iam not getting sound on left one the other grill is the microphone not the speaker
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the official apple assistance sent me new iphone se unit received it yesterday setup it as new unit lost all data weeks of runs recorded with my apple watch gen thinking some random errors in old watch or iphone backup this morning had new run with my new unit using watch and nike run on iphone the battery was at when back home after min the battery was at and overheated when is overheated and its only in idle battery drain another before stabilizing had chat with assistance technician call me and we have did remote test test is ok we agreed to wait until next week didnt have this issues with my previous iphone se gen had fast drain battery only with very cold weather or very heavy usage am using it very little because after these experiences am really negative everything drain battery and overheated after simply old call too bought this phone with economic sacrifice because my old one broke and need new iphone for icloud but im truly sorry to have spent for this unit and no less in old refurbished unit the authorized dealer of my country does not provide for any refund and im very tired
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),agree on battery and screen other then that every else no the is beyond any android at more phone se having two grills below but iam not getting sound on left one
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),androids dont lag have phone and have been having it for years never lagged more absolutely true even have dollar android phone which im using right now to reply your comment great mah battery inch display
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),an iphone se or samsung series which should get advice to go for the samsung
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),piece of junk if you are in weak service area we need phone not glorified object
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),only bad thing is poor battery life thats huge draw back for me my old samsung has hrs more poor battery life this phone can hold more battery then my old ss and mi mix and mi battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),ridiculous inch display forget it backwards down grade not everyone needs behemoth sized phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),if it means anything im loooong time android flagship buyer and the se is my first real iphone like it enough to have given my oneplus to my sister this thing is perfection its small very powerful and finally great camera that doesnt take whole lot of effort to take amazing photos with if they hadnt have made this phone no chance id have spent on to find out
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),ill advise you to wait for the iphone almost the same price as the se but with tons more no way in hell that apple will sell their regular model for cheap even the basic vanilla iphone will be priced thats more than times the price of basic se for that price better buy any flagshipkiller android which have several times battery longevity times display resolution qhd better audio quality expandable storage as well as dual sims yet you still have some change even after buying it unlike iphone where have to buy the charger separately
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),with screen and small battery it looks like it was designed as replacement for more have se and selected it for two good reasons one due to storage capacity and the other it is small to easily be kept in the pocket
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple deliberately designed the se unattractive or so so it wont attract kids or yo more it is attractive though and this is for the hands of the youth not suitable for elderly people as the screen is too small you are way too behind on this hahahahaha
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),conclusion phone for kids ddddd apple deliberately designed the se unattractive or so so it wont attract kids or youth or the young market elders will like this though its the sole purpose of using year old design for fashionable phone as its purpose to get the more fashion aware to purchase the more expensive iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),younite jun oh yay we have sides of people here people who like the phone and the people who hate it more totally agree also if one needs good compact phone would go for se or just wait for iphone which solves all the problems you mentioned bad lcd low res display very weak battery lack of wide angle and night modus in camera it will be bit more expensive but am sure it is worth the difference after all people dont get new phone every month with iphone an average use is good to go at least three years
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),how about iphone se with iphone se in body but with both face id in notch and touch id in more lol no
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),as for as am saying that will buy one plus pro with almost gigs of ram and also the more you do know ram doesnt really matter on ios right ios isnt as resource intensive as android meaning they dont actually need that much ram gb or gb ram iphone can compete with android device with double or triple the ram
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),hello everyone know that we all are tech lovers we cant stop fantasizing about more ram more agree with you there people need to understand apple doesnt make phones for everyone its only for like you said of the market they dont care if you would rather android if their products sell and the users like it not people who think its bad device mean an actual user then apple are happy so what is xiaomi is cheap but has big battery and zoom it doesnt concern people who want reliable phone that lasts years unlike with xiaomis devices doubt apple cares about any of the chinese brands expect oneplus and huawei and obviously samsung
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),sorry but you sound like an apple fanboy trying to sell the iphone se as the best phone more and why does it matter that heshe is fan of apple let people be happy with their products maybe they liked so much they think more people should buy shouldnt mean anything to you
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),hdr dolby atmos visuals and great camera decent
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),those greedy little bastards took out the mm jack even tho they had enough money to install touch sensitive home button then they had the audacity to sell separate mm jack adapter to profit more money what about the other people like me who still use headphones with mm jack its just money steal
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),worried se due to old design concept but it was totally wrong really wonderful harmony between original and new fashion trend now its difficult to me to decide my daughters present se or velvet
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),picked mine up because of size and price as my first smart phone and technically it seems more im glad that you finally know how to use the phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),gb black iphone se bought it online on my birthday may th its simply the more sorry but you sound like an apple fanboy trying to sell the iphone se as the best phone ever wait reading back your comment you really are fanboy arent you
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),nice but im not buying it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),oh yay we have sides of people here people who like the phone and the people who hate it here is my opinion on it speed what more do have to say on screen simply amazing display butthats where the fun ends screen with ancient bezels lcd and hz this is quite bad in and honestly this is literally an insult however the brightness is decent and the ancient bezels are needed to bring back that home button and touch id overall camera first of all this is single camera so no ultra wide telephoto or depth sensor second wow this is actually quite good good photos with nice dynamic range however notsogood photos in the night but you get the best video at this price point with ois camera is no multiple lenses is bummer and video is battery painful painful painful in mrwhosethebosss battery test it got measly hours of sot and in this review it got hr endurance rating for comparison the se got hours the charging speeds arent any better charger comes in the box only saving grace being wireless charging audio and build quality these are pretty good of course coming from apple the audio is great and the device has ip water resistance and very nice build wrap up the iphone se is weird device its for person who wants compact phone wants ios on budget isnt super techy wants the best speed at the lowest price needs good camera at the lowest price if youre none of these the iphone se is probably not for you if it is lets consider some more options before you swipe that credit card samsung galaxy se better screen way better battery life an extra ultra wide camera and is still compact my personal pick if you want compact phone worse video and speed although they still are pretty good huawei lite better screen way way better battery life and more cameras but no gms which is big bummer oneplus this phone has gone down in price so so much and is honestly way better than all the other phones right here not compact though so do keep that in mind bunch of xiaomi and realme phones none of which are compact though overall the iphone se is really niche option good but not amazing there are better options for compact phones and phones at this price point but it can still hold its own with its speed video and audio thanks for reading if you disagree thats ok just reply and we can discuss
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),my se was yrs already and still on ios but really dont have complain of how still smooth it was it even fall to salty water and camera doesnt change like my android phones was planning to buy the version but was still dissapointed of the batteryi love how handy it was to my hands
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),who in the of population cares about native file manager there is one app called files when you download file in program api you can save it to files app from there you have the possibility to share or use any other app to open
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),because youre ignorant at keeping up at both ios and androids developments over the years more who in the of population cares about native file manager
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),you know what there is no point in arguing in you android fanbois all you guys do is support more because youre ignorant at keeping up at both ios and androids developments over the years simplest example which ios version finally had lol ffs file manager thats right ios good two years after android marshmallow had its own native file manager and dont even get me started on notifications even ui implementation from china called miui beat ios by years apparently without android ios dev team cant even figure out which core features to bake in
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),hi all think the best small phone now butyou need to know that there are lot of bugs more apple doesnt lag at all
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),most complete review that ive seen yet
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),its graet phonme
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),can charger be used to charge iphone se the website has only conducted tests for
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),fast charging isnt problem keep your lies about battety degradation to yourself apple more you know what there is no point in arguing in you android fanbois all you guys do is support random android companies by bashing apple and saying bla bla bla no fast chargin no ultrawide and telephoto cameras no good software no flexibility no no no no no and yet apple is doing better then ever in terms of sales and profit seriously who in the of non techy people actually care about the latest features of software so remember we need you android fanbois to keep on bashing apple cause it only helps sales so keep up the hard work and no years later ios is far more feature packed then any android software years ago you know what lets compare ios with android ios is sooo superior
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),lol fam you are such funny android fanboi would you rather loose your entire phones capaci more fast charging isnt problem keep your lies about battety degradation to yourself apple is using inferior fast charging tech dont worry youll get fast charging on your iphone in software support lol half the year they keep fixing bugs since they roll out half baked versions of ios and android from years back can do more things than current ios software support being better exists only on paper in the real world ios is simply playing catchup with android what good is that software support when you are getting latest features in the tech world years late what good is that software support when your battery and cpu are being slowed down deliberately with each subsequent update
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),well they are known to slow down older phones with subsequent updates battery degradation th more lol fam you are such funny android fanboi would you rather loose your entire phones capacity and software support in yearfast charging is the problem or would you rather get slightly slower performance for sustained battery life and actual software support even you fanboys talk all day about cant notice difference in realworld usage stuff yet hypocrite yourselfs by talking about apple slowing down their phones for battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),joke of the year from the greediest of firm that battery life is laughably awful in should have at least had mah but then again its apple and their intelligent audience so its fine guess
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),am big fan of your site am checking the daily updates from about yrs wants to work with the gsmarena team thats the dream and only thats why had opted for etc
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),no need of proof ask any top tech youtuber or ppl in tech community theyll tell you how ve more have se phone just year completed both phone cannot on same time new se launched and old model automatically our old phone will start problems it seems they are trying to insist the customers to purchase new phone by cheating way
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),proof pls no need of proof ask any top tech youtuber or ppl in tech community theyll tell you how verge is joke laughing stock you must be casual
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),everyone knows verge is laughing stock which makes any statements you further make less cr more proof pls
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),lol why would the verge be biased towards apple its not like apple is paying them unlike hu more everyone knows verge is laughing stock which makes any statements you further make less credible
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),that would mean they have to remove home button theres still lot of people who want more how do you know alot of ppl prefer the home button compared to bigger screen did you do survey then why are latest proper apple phones small bezel without home button on your logic you can say alot of ppl still prefer nokia phones smh the only reason the se sells is because too many ppl wants the apple brand but could not afford the price tag hence they buy the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),this review is joke if you removed the apple branding it would get stars also cant more exactly just look at the low quality photos of the se they are on par with low end androids today the author better check his eyesight
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),verge is totally biased towards apple biased doesnt mean theyll give bad reviews to other more lol why would the verge be biased towards apple its not like apple is paying them unlike huawei and other chinese companies paying dxomark for good scores and no the verge actually understands that their main audienceprobably americans want an iphone and lets look at the shortcomings low ram who in the other of people who arent techies actually care not edge to edge amoled display with high refresh rates around of the people in this world dont actually care about those things either gaming triggers if your actually want to play serious games dont do it on phone no periscope zoom or superhighresolution ultrawide camera of people dont care either
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),please use innovative headlines oneliners like you used to in past it was fun
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),small battery life small screen with wasting home button and header it would be good if no home button and header change to full screen it is completly the same as iphone nothing change android phones are better compair to the price apple its time to change dont be stingy
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),for its price what do you expect show me better lamedroid phone at its price all those phones are better than this niche midget screen device most ppl wouldnt touch the se with foot pole
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the samsung is cheaper in the uk even ignoring the need to buy faster charger for th more as for as am totally agreeing to buy samsung rahter than the phone se
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),is such bad compromise its too small to shift ones hand comfortably to use onehanded like and not near comfortably like software is too small anyway so might as well have went with
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),will it support if not will phones in present maket phones be relevent to connectivity
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),if only the battery would have been more than mah would buy this iphone se
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),its phone with big bezel year old camera and tiny battery that takes too long to charge whats to like
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),excuse me anandtech but the verge no they gave excellent reviews for samsung more verge is totally biased towards apple biased doesnt mean theyll give bad reviews to other manufacturers but they will cover up for shortcomings of apple devices heck even their pc build videos are laughing stock for the entire tech community
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),phonearena verge cnet anandtech are super biased towards apple excuse me anandtech but the verge no they gave excellent reviews for samsung phones as well and oppo phonesfind pro got and bunch of other phones the verge actually thinks about what nontech person would want and gives reccomendations based off that gsma is more based off valuemoney and features
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),oh god that battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),but they will be target for many laughs either way only by you the actual public seems to like them
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),great phone for haha would be better
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),no wonder why you cant have true daily experience with android fyi apps stability speed more good day to you too but did use xiaomi mi for about weeks as daily driver as my iphone was broken for while so did have decent exerpeince with android and like said before did have solid android phone not too ling ago
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),it depends exynos runs hot and battery life is pretty bad have se with exynos in it more even with exynos it will hold better than iphone se with mah battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),like said it doesnt matter what phone the android is the apps always turn out worse then more no wonder why you cant have true daily experience with android fyi apps stability speed and compatibility varies on different brands and models of android ill not dig in too deeper as your insights looks so inclined to iphone good day and enjoy your iphone experience
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),and also can assume that you dont have an iphone but you also dont have new flagship co more yes dont own any iphone but bought iphone pro max for my daughter last november when did ever tell you that own samsung had very bad experience with when shifted from mate fyi my current daily driver is still mate as mate lacks google support why should lie read and understand my comment before assuming anything
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the four stars dont do this justice this is the most revolutionary midranger since the nexu more yes its so revolutionary that apple has managed to convince that garbage battery in phone is still great bargain
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),to give this phone fair review from android boy whats good cpu apple support lo more battery life even with that small capacity expected more than what we get mean it scores lower than iphone can gsma redo battery test might software update improve that dont know sorry to disappoint you but nothings fixing the performance of the meager battery once the applauded kicks in as in when playing game the battery will drain so fast that even plugging the phone in wont help
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),oh wow was wrong about the battery endurance maaaaan that could be deal breaker to me uu could
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),reviewers from gsmarena can you please explain hours endurance from iphone is pretty good hours endurance from motorola moto plus is pretty underwhelming and very dissapointing please explain because dont get it thx
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),you are right it is not phone from still think that many people will usebuy it nope it is phone from that outclasses every android phone in performance sells for the price of midrange nokia and will be supported for half decade at minimum incredible value will still be using this in to look at my investments which generate more monthly income than you pajeets make in year
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),reviewers that get review units write nice things as they want to get them in the future as th more exactly they are also barred from talking about shortcomings of the device as part of the contract very few reviewers out there these days who give completely unbiased reviews whether its android or apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),surprising cry baby cant handle it maybe you should just write iphone se more reviewers that get review units write nice things as they want to get them in the future as they bring them views and they earn money reviewers that bought the phone by themself write the exact truth
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),phone arena gave lol phonearena verge cnet anandtech are super biased towards apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple sales usually consist of brand boys wholl buy anything from apple blindly theyll ev more apple sales usually consist of brand boys wholl buy anything from apple blindly theyll even buy sht packaged in box if it has an apple logo on it and more childish insecure android boy comments if thats true why homepod isnt selling or why most apple users doesnt have apple tv heck why dont even by far most not use mac those people who you think dont buy apple blindly they buy it because they been using apple products for many years and knows what they get thats called brand recognition bought ipad because it had apple logo if you want to put it like that mean didnt had any idea what im buying it was completely new product category except it does mostly same stuff than my iphone which already been using years and liking it so what can go wrong homepod with apple logo doesnt sell because its not product most really need so yes your comment is just typical insecure android boy comment only after the purchase they realize that they have been fooled into buying an iphone with chip sure sure of course can almost feel the anger you have reading that reddit post personally have lot of fun reading it it just big slap in android boys face like you
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),you do understand that screen size can be fit in the same physical dimensions as se more that would mean they have to remove home button theres still lot of people who want to keep that physical home button who like the old way theres already phone like you describing its iphone xs and pro no need to do another one this se is how it is because theres still big market for phone like this sales are already proving it this se is selling really well and most funny part is how many android users are switching look this reddit thread with almost thousand comments iphone se already seeing strong sales android switchers httpswwwredditcomrapplecommentsgdvutiphonesealreadyseeingstrongsalesandroid must be painful read for insecure android boy like you
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),come on would be super phone with android without bezzels it would be great compact ph more you do understand that screen size can be fit in the same physical dimensions as se people these days just blindly look at screen size and throw hissy fit not taking into account physical dimensions of the phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),hes problem like many other android fanboys is the fact that they think everyone wants same more dont understand also why they dont buy this most gorgeous jewel in the world they jelous of our phone has apple logo on it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),no one you said love the small footprint of the inch phone that can use single ha more hes problem like many other android fanboys is the fact that they think everyone wants same than what they want which of course couldnt be any more wrong
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),mega hate is against the tiny screen size had it been between which can be ea more come on would be super phone with android without bezzels it would be great compact phone those bezzelless fake renders from iphone se were beautifull remmember when bought htc one after htc dezire and was thinking what big phone it is then had also nexus lg and it was one of the greatest phone from construction point of view is enough for daily bussiness even with ppi it would be dream phone with fhd display with smallno bezzels and not curved sd and gb ramstorrage put some better dual camera and make it global with more nettworks make it dualtrio sim and it would be best manager phone in world
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),some people look for smaller phone despite the resolution this phone still have ppi fo more lmao imagine buying phone for logo truly sad
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),sorry but you should compare it with ultra or pixel xl as their prices and specs suggest and also can assume that you dont have an iphone but you also dont have new flagship correct me if wrong and please dont lie saying you have samsung ultra cuz by the sounds of it you dont id like to hear what phone you have if you dont mind so can get my point across
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),today you find some huge screen mid range androids for the same price of the se or cheaper but more good luck using the phone for five years with mere mah battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),you propably didnt knew but iphone with that tiny screen was sixth best selling smartphone more you do realize that the galaxy was best selling android phone with inch screen size way back in see how that works no one wants tiny screen after getting accustomed to inch screen size only fruit logo brand boys be buying this blindly bet if apple shts in your mouth youd call it yummy
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),ok you are right with the price my foul those phones are cheaper but imagine if it wou more mega hate is against the tiny screen size had it been between which can be easily fit in that form factor no one wouldve hated it no one would buy sd android device with tiny screen since everything from content consumption gaming web browsing even normal texting and typing becomes cumbersome on such tiny display atleast with battery you can carry power bank even though thats inconvenient but you cant just increase the screen size on the go
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),night mode is overrated feature imo just get neuralcam app and youll make amazing bright and detailed night photos even in near perfect darkness was hoping for night mode to come to iphone xr with ios given it still has neural processing unit but it didnt then found neuralcam and got night mode on xr so im not really missing anything on it and given hardware specs neuralcam should also run on se easily same ram faster cpu
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),nailed it nick am so close to giving up on gsmarena as community reading all the cry more why do you care what anyone says the actual customers will talk with their wallets whats so bad about it class leading sales chart will shut all the naysayers if this phone has it in it im symbian fan and understand that majority is not always right was on screen uptill now im on although on android and no productivity wise everything is going good
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),yes compared it to my honor but did also compare it to girlfriends phone samsung se more sorry but you should compare it with ultra or pixel xl as their prices and specs suggest
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),wow thats huge leap from honor to iphone pro max which costs more sure you sho more yes compared it to my honor but did also compare it to girlfriends phone samsung se now that phone is somewhat recent but again there were more problems with the android versions of the apps it is simply just worse not bad experience on android for example reddit was just plain bad on the samsung though it did get bit better in the recent update snapchat looks like it takes screen shots of the camera doesnt even take proper photos our tesla app is horrible on the se but compared to the ios it is near flawless in fairness most not all most are near identical on both os but devs simply put more effort into ios because off apples requirements unlike on google play store all you have to do is pay google and boom you can upload your app with all its bugs and possible malicious software to be honest it is fact that apps on ios is simply just better than android at this point
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),yes ive been an android user for good few years my first phone was an android my last ph more wow thats huge leap from honor to iphone pro max which costs more sure you should be getting better experience for that huge amount of money since you already shifted to iphone then just enjoy it btw iphone se cant be comparable to your current daily driver
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),old specs boring system and same old design major pass
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),camera was made in
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),httpswwwgsmarenacomresultsphpnyearminndisplaydensitymax dont be ridiculous those phones are not midrangers these are low end models moreover most of them are very cheap in my country xperia is about usd realme costs usd iphone se costs euro so yup this is apple premium pricing and now take look at new xperia mk ii it has much bigger oled screen much bigger battery and costs less than iphone se ok the soc is much slower but it is fast enough for mid range drvice
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),too bad apple already redefine retina iphone resolution is not longer retina not true
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),neither your nor my eyes have got higher resolution since if you have ppi above re more too bad apple already redefine retina iphone resolution is not longer retina
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple want everyone to think so but if ppi is enough so why ipro has more can you exp more apple want everyone to think so but if ppi is enough so why ipro has more can you explain it oled screen have to be higher in resolution to look as sharp as lcd its how the pixels are build with the oled when iphone xr came compared it to my and both looked very good really couldnt see any noticable difference in sharpness maybe if would really have tried to compare them together but overall both had great looking screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),httpswwwgsmarenacomresultsphpnyearminndisplaydensitymax which one is more expensive or even at equal price point with this phone you have more expensive phones with such display resolution you clearly stated that name one which is more expensive one you cant at most as checked few of them they cost half the price some cost less than quarter than this phone im aware that phones with subfullhd and many even less than hdp displays are still made actually like this phone but it has some setbacks for me and im perfectly fine with my current phone and android they arent best but satisfy my needs
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),ive just bought one love it such little powerful thing
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),isnt exactly mid ranger are for you can barley buy normal phone not midranger am from europe and if you want or not apple is still considered as premium brand where you are also paying this desktop laptop headphones it is not as easy to find such phone it has body of ca what is nowadays considered as small phone you have enough power to work with it and it has ordinary camera not good not bad it is not bad phone and lot of people will buy it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),name one httpswwwgsmarenacomresultsphpnyearminndisplaydensitymax
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),it has over ppi it is enough for midranger you have more expensive phones with such di more name one
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),there are android phones with inches above screen size in similar form factor most will more but then those phones that are similar to iphone se in form factor but have larger display will be running on android which may become dealbreaker for people looking to buy se to break down what said earlier about the target audience of this phone people who wants to make switch to apple ecosystem obviously no android in this case kids whose friends also use idevices noniphones dont benefit from imessages or facetime their friend use to communicate with each other so android isnt an option those trying to replace their older compact iphones iphone se will provide an identical usability form factor and the display aspect ratio as iphone and basically they dont have to change their habit in any way to adopt to this new iphone android phones with taller aspect ratio might give you more screen real estate for the similar form factor but everything else including ui will be different so unless they are sick of small display and ios then android will be unlikely viable option for them android users who need iphone for various reasons why bother getting another android phone when they need ios and again time will tell if youre making correct guess or not
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),do you know how small inch display is and it even come with hd screen only this phone is more youre missing the point of this phone its not for people who care about all the new tech its for people who want to enter the apple ecosystem or simply want to upgrade their older iphones like iphone setc its also aimed at app developers who just need cheap iphone with the latest processor it is simply refresh just like last years and trust me there are thousands of people who prefer the older design
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),owned ios until last year but started learning the confines of ios so switched and now hate ios may ask why you have come to hate ios personally prefer it over android any day but do like android due to customization
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),were you even for once an android user who also download apps from google playstore which is more yes ive been an android user for good few years my first phone was an android my last phone before my iphone pro max was the honor loved the phone but as was comparing it to my iphone there are lot of apps that were badly optimized on the phone considering it had then huaweis best soc the kirin for example instagram was horrible compared to the ios counterpart it relies on java for its apps and java as programming language has its limitations owing to its resource intensive nature ios on other hand has its own native runtime and the apps written for it are written in swift which is based on objectivec unlike java theres no virtual machine layer between the system and the app when your run an app it runs on the os utilizing native runtime libraries so theres substantially less resource overhead also android apps are more likely to get infected from bugs and malware as compared to ios apps because one main reason behind that is the approval process for developers which is pretty fast and insecure in google as compared to apples policy lastly app devs simply prefer ios over android behind why app developers prefer ios platform than android in which one of the biggest reason is that its much easier to develop attractive apps on ios then android because design plays key role in ios apps app developers can earn more profit from ios apps meaning they simply put more effort in to the app am not saying that all apps are bad on android but it is fact that lot of apps and games simply run better on ios rather than android and there might be cases of it being the opposite but in android there is just too much hardware to optimize there is too many variables on androids side of things to get it very nicely optimized
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),two main issues for me small screen no dual camera for almost euros european price more thats why its only bud
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),its hilarious that many of those in this website can be this negative towards this new iphone more nailed it nick am so close to giving up on gsmarena as community reading all the crybaby android fans on every single apple article is getting very tiresome and they do not comprehend any of the points made when argued with they just continue barking out the same tired cliches that every other android fan baas out work in it and am tech enthusiast this phone is absolutely perfect for nontech enthusiasts as well as tech enthusiasts its certainly on my radar if my current iphone se dies unlikely given the far far superior build quality compared to any other phone manufacturer sans sony
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),so ppi from iphone very impresive indeed neither your nor my eyes have got higher resolution since if you have ppi above retina you only waste processing power and battery ppi is at the limit of what your eyes can perceive at inches there is web site called is this retina which you can use for comparing different devices resolutions
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),so ppi from iphone very impresive indeed ppi is more than enoug more yeah my iphone is more than enough iphone or whatever se is rubbish
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),no average user apple or android wants to downgrade to inch screen think the time wi more but when you retain the body size while downgrade to smaller screen is downgrade
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),this is atrocious the screen size is barely watchable typeable and on top of that battery life sucks are we in
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),is hd is full hd when size is not being compared you would compare the re more so ppi from iphone very impresive indeed
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),high quality screen lol not even hd come on crapleyou can do better its so sad is hd is full hd when size is not being compared you would compare the resolution in ppi
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),despite the comments and ire reviews from folks who were not going to buy it anyway its good enough replacement for my dying se from its too easily forgotten this phone isnt supposed to be compared to the pro or the latest oneplus phone its supposed to be compared to the old se because thats what its replacing
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),dear gsmarena staff dont care about ihone ses audio test because it doesnt have ja more indeed not every headphone output is equal some phones could have usb ports and an included dongle that emits analogue sound other phones require dac in the dongle not every headphone is equal higherend headphones require more power and different dacs are not as capable at driving those even if the average headphone output is pretty good there are some that are significantly worse than the norm and we consumers want to know which those are
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),exactly compact phone doesnt imply small display prefer as compact phone somethin more most of the parts are from leftovers they simply dumping them into so called new device
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),let me tell you one thing being tech enthusiast and not looking at this product from av more no average user apple or android wants to downgrade to inch screen think the time will prove you otherwise not everybody considers smaller form factor inferiour or downgrade
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),for future proofing the phone so it can last years before needing to be replaced and since it more but its like when you run hp engine car in room with view you or anybody else wont need that absolute power to perform daily common tasks imho the newest iphone se its just for show just to demonstrate others you have the most powerful chipset on earth built on years old phone has no logic behind absolute power must come with right features if you want to harness it properly bigger screen higher dpi longer battery life etc let me put another example could you properly and happily do your job on latest state of the art imac or mac pro with screen guess not
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),agreed bet of the comments here have not ever owned and iphone unlike android apple de more were you even for once an android user who also download apps from google playstore which is also providing regular app screening and updates
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),mah battery in lol so you expect to have mah battery what joke
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),gsm arena reviewed this phone as flagship and thats not what it is for its category except in screen size resolution and battery capacity this phone is practically unmatched sometimes wished people said the truth especially when its staring right in their face
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),if people can convince themselves that they dont need the latest most powerful desktop or laptop they can do the same for the cell phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),most folks are not spec sheet sniffers nor have the means for phones would wholeheartedly recommend this phone to them and they will be happier than ever
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),poor bettery
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),retest after weeks just to be sure agree with you because after cycles of charging the battery lifes seem to improve usually that is when the battery is capable of peak preformance
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),would rather get se or slightly used oneplus or pixel for the price pointthey ar more think that you are missing the point this is not new phone just refurbishment of the iphone it is made for people who prefer the older design and want new iphone for cheaper price that will last long would definitely recommend this to lot of people who want to get new iphone for cheaper but agree with you on that would rather get an oneplus or something similarly priced
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),yep apples phones are so well optimized compared to most androids that those who have never more agreed bet of the comments here have not ever owned and iphone unlike android apple devs and the app devs for ios put lot more effort into the apps unlike in android yes the big companies like google might put lot of effort but lot of the smaller app companies dont put that much effort hence lot of bugs
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple are you kidding me are you trying to sell iphone with different name lack of innova more chill its just refurbished iphone with better soc this isnt something the company are showing off as their new tech its just allow people who prefer the older design more to buy new iphone that will last long as you can see apple didnt even have an announcement so its not like they are showing off how cool and innovative it is anyways this phone is and iphone but cheaper and faster like said just an refurbishment and recycling old parts
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),because apple fan start to bragging its the best phone in and how magical it is nope more disagree think that its just android fans more specifically people who love xiaomi opporealme etc basically any fan who like android phones from chinese companies think that they are hating on it because there are better android alternatives personally think the se is great option considering its just an iphone but future proofed at lower price dont see any apple fans boasting about how great this phone is because it isint you what is great iphone the trio but this is just an iphone at lower cost not aimed at the xioami nor realme just regular cheap iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),mah battery and hours screen on time in seriously and years old desi more some people look for smaller phone despite the resolution this phone still have ppi for normal use without tele and wide the camera will slay most of sub budget phone thanks to apple tuning some of the smartphone at bracket will be able to compete tough for the most part you pay for the apple name and mostly for the soc which is on par with basically current flagships which are rather unfortunate considering this phone have sucky battery and hour to charge that sucky battery not sure whether the charging rate is enough to charge the phone while you game on it on powerbank while the current xseries is full day battery phone this is half day battery phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),please add headphone jack this is only the good idea to this think get cheapest to all
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),if you consider buying this phone first think about what you want this is great phone but has its shortcomings you should buy this phone if you want good build quality want wter resistance on your phone dont need long lasting battery are fine with single camera setup want an iphone but are on budget you should look for aomething else if you want long lasting battery life to last you that extended usage use ultrawide and telephoto cameras lot watch videos or play games lot on your phone have problems typing on small screens love your wired headphones better mean sony headphones have better sound quality than airpods no one can blame anyone for not wanting to overpay your other options are higher priced iphones upper midrangers or flagship killers or older flagships not every phone is for everyone get your priorities right
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),english please english please
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),so you hate so much display you hate so much poor battery life any yet mah sot more english please
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),yes indeed the honor is lightyears ahead and it doesnt even have the google services pr more inlt doesnt matter for me am happy without google apps services can still use by browser and rd oart apps hate apples file system restrictions over anything in android
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),redmi pro for overall usage and honor for camera experience are light years ahead more yes indeed the honor is lightyears ahead and it doesnt even have the google services preinstalled no gmail no youtube no google chrome whatsoever
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),remember the battery although small is optimized much better than any android my se lasts more read the endurance section
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),se is apples cynical taunt at its buyers it stands for six and eight its there to remind you that you keep buying the same phone and keep telling yourself its bargain
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),in germany this iphone se is euros exactly in europe price of this phone is ridiculous or insane over euros for obselete small screen small memory capacity and worthless battery apple should be ashamed google nexus had better screen in at least it had apple hahaha
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),why even bother to get this junk when oneplus xiaomi mi note samsung note lite and huawei are about the same price as this
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),after using mipro im never gonna consider small battery phone again and coupled with slow charge is unthinkable
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),thats one thick phone actually dont mind phones to be thicker so that they can house bigger battery phones nowadays are too obsess with thinness until they forced consumers to accept ugly camera hump as normal
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),what about something called people with iphone get through full day of usage so why cant more lol literally apple fanboi
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),in my country where the biggest mobile phone retail chain is still selling iphone gb vers more poor people they have to suffer with such terrible phones after months with iphone got at work say never more apple and the se just confirmed it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),clearly clearly clearly you have not used phone before are you still living in wake up this is thick bezels arent the norm now thats an ancient feature which doesnt suit phones coming out in
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),sony xperia xz compact also has screen but it comes with mah battery and it lasts more thats one thick phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),finally an official review ive been refreshing daily just to find out your lab results for the battery life thank you gsmarena big hug
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),speed and camera is good but not so good when the battery life is poor and turns into brick afterwards
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),mr may another overrated under performed outdated phone from apple take galaxy over this any day galaxy is an underpowered outdated piece of junk with its super laggy os and severely weak quad core exynos chipset its also made from cheap plastic if android is must then the outgoing redmi pro or realme pro wont dissapoint both are fast phones and their quality is dependable not the best though
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),highquality screen and impresses with camera performance even if it misses feature or two lcd with something ppd is now high quality and no the image quality doesnt impress looks like something out of phone and it doesnt miss feature of two lol it misses ton of features no telephoto ultra wide macro tof etc battery backup is hilarious by standards and why the skewed alternative suggestion there are two great phones costing around which gsma didnt even mention the pro and honor both are better than the se and pixel in every aspect except the processor shame for not recommending those too
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),like all the features of this phone like the fast processor the premium built quality the gorgeous inch bezeless amoled screen the large mah battery the telephoto camera oops am in the wrong section
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),why such hype for an old iphone it is just skipped delayed old iphone nothing else
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the only valid criticism here is for the battery otherwise it would be great daily driver for lot of people not people who read or comment on gsmarena though this phone might not be for you but still great for many general users and it will show on the sales number average users wont care about the design or bezels as much as you do the smaller screen size would be good tradeoff for compact lightweight phone if you own an older iphone and were waiting for an upgrade this might seem straight forward choice without spending lot of money people who are attracted to ios ecosystem but couldnt afford will consider it too years of guaranteed updates excellent camera for the price ip wireless charging for this price is welcome addition too charger is meh but support for means you have an option if it bothers you too much if you are light user you can just charge overnight and use it for the day
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),that is why do not believe newer cpus are that power saving compared to old ones more dont know how true the random number they throw every year less power consumption is but it is supposed to be power used for similar performance so while they have lower battery consumption they wont last or times because they have better computational performance
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple doesnt compare to the cheap chinese phones flooding the indian market once you try an more can you please explain how the bezel is helpful
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),huawei and honor chinese phones no google play support
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),another overrated under performed outdated phone from apple take galaxy over this any day
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),bezel bezels bezels ugly ugly ugly the notch in the video screen is stupider
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),unbelievable that this phone gets stars first of all its not all that cheap specially in more apple doesnt compare to the cheap chinese phones flooding the indian market once you try an iphone you might start demanding better too this is great entry for many the battery is fine for full day since most charge their phone every night and bezels can be useful to many
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),part screen resolution screen is in ppi which is good for human eye how many more im glad you mentioned the lumia battery life as current longtime windows phone user so can agree with you have lumia and also lumia xl even with both phones running the very last build of windows mobile still can get nearly days of battery life despite heavy use that said still remembered the day when my was running windows phone it had more than days of battery life since started using windows phone my power bank is now only reserved for my old backup android phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),have looked at all the photo samples and the photo quality is exactly the same as any iphone models no thanks never like the photo quality of bionic iphones it oversharpens so much that you can even see it on simple pc monitor or tv think may buy the iphones maybe the xr would be better buy
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple will easily sell more than million units of this device
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),that was time remember not only samsung but also others phone screen size in ra more remember the battery although small is optimized much better than any android my se lasts the whole day even with heavy use it manages to last at least till the morning the chipset is extremely efficient and therefore lasts much longer than my android with bigger battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),and if you want more memory due to not have expandable memory up to euros for the gb more easy fix dont buy it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),ah when samsung managed to squeeze mah of battery into body that was time remember not only samsung but also others phone screen size in ratio like this one se battery mah inside tickness about only mm more than se it will be great for the se owners that this phone have at least mah battery endurance ranting will be then hope iphone will be better compact iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),galaxy for example but its even older than iphone that se is based on still you more ah when samsung managed to squeeze mah of battery into body
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),what joke of review fast processor put in yr old design with low resolution screen more but iphone with screen size more compact body than this one bigger battery oled screen higher resolution of the screen looks promising
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),battery life sucks whats the point in this phone battery life for the last apple phone unbelievable first se was much better for all in
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),endurance rating of is lower than that of iphone and so the battery life is supposedly worse than all of them am reading that right
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),my suspicion is that it was deliberate on apples part to have large bezels and small batter more how is it deliberate when apple was still selling the iphone for just before the announcement of the iphone se hits nobody made noise when apple was still selling the for but slap an bionic chip on it reduce its price by and suddenly everybody is harking on how bad deal the new se is
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),oddly feel like the best market for this might be lighter users perhaps older people who more older people have eye problems that will be exacerbated by the tiny screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),while this is bad phone the rating is the same as the ultra stars so the more haha you ate the biggest samsung and exynos hater on this site samsung dead in your dreams pal it will take years for samsung to be dead httpsyoutubeqaagk
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),think gsmarena should post an article with explanation oneplus pro gets hrs web browsing with battery iphone above gets over one hour more with battery for iphone video test gets only hrs usually video time web browsing time but fun is ahead you phone call which doesnt use screen hrs my question is how will be look battery life on mobile data during on line game when you use screen processor and mobile data will be there hrs if stupid streaming on wifi which doesnt involve to much cpu took results hrs many people also have questions about battery results on oneplus and oneplus pro think its time for some additional tests and explanation about results in all phones
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),battery life that will become less for each year they could have simply improved that without increasing battery dimensions but know its possible to make it larger ill burn through the battery within day with lte and some gaming in typical work day
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),part was just going through all comments since the announcement of iphone se criticism is specifically for few things as listed below bezels in this trend of so called bezeless design iphone se has ugly bezels but reality is every phone has bezels but those are smartly hidden by extending the screen on sides popularly called infinity display this gives an impression that its bezeless but in reality its just an illusion bezels are structural requirements which cannot be avoided and most importantly those using bezeless phones can tell about increased efficiency due to low bezels to increased due to bezeless design design of iphone yes they have recycled design of iphone people with an eye for design would tell you that most of the phones in market today have more or less the same design specially oneplus phones are more of oppo vivo designs recycled oneplus fans will never comment on design same may apply to many brands only motorola apple blackberry and sony have unique design identity camera cameras are helpful functions iphones have always been amongst those good ones in terms of picture quality if high numbers and high megapixels were the only criteria then nokia pureview or huawei quadcam phones would have been the only bestsellers camera of iphone se is good as it should be and if cameras are the only thing that buyer wants then they have options of pro and promax for those who can pay for it those serious about photography will always prefer professional camera rather than mobile camera
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),so the year old camera setup and and display get star rating
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),why the battery life is lesser of iphone while the processor is newer
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the phone isnt bad at all if the bezels were made thin the starting price would have jumped to
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),mise can offer much more than this
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),wtf with the battery endurance though this phone can become my list but unfortunately not apple still love to do milking their consumer for premium phone will pick xperia ii for sure its gorgeous for premium affordable phone will pick rog or zen for sure its the most worth in its price point
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),how was the not mentioned in alternatives better in every way except cpu and camera
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),how funny battery score just
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),mr anonymous may in europe one can buy samsung se for the same price would choose it any time of day ins more it depends exynos runs hot and battery life is pretty bad have se with exynos in it the battery is really bad half an hour video call eats of battery cant get the whole day with single charge fortunately am at home because of coronavirus so dont have battery dead phone otherwise it would be painful for me everything else is good though its fluid display is awesome one ui is great fingerprint sensor is fast the phone is comfortable to hold guess the camera should be better than se lite should be better deal even if someone pays euros more
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),irrelevant in small screen battery outdated design
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),endurance rating failed
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),which phone has mah galaxy for example but its even older than iphone that se is based on still you can get se for close to now thats very similar in size but with much bigger and better screen and mah battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),ill totally get this once lockdown is lifted in our country
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),go back and read again its hrs hahaha hours is still awful would have bought and switched to apple if the battery endurance would have been in the hours range like the original se was even then that doesnt compare well to android midrangers but this phone was never going to have good battery life sadly to be fair battery life is the only compromise is very strong package still not enough to tempt me from upper midrange androids
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),im sad and feel sorry for apple if were tim cook would never have allowed such very dated low end ugly looking phone with low quality screen and ugly exterior design bear the iphone branding and logo it kills the prestigious luxurious iphone brand image that steve jobs have worked very hard for the iphone se looks like counterfeit iphone wannabe its as if apple is so desperate to attract android users that it had to make heavy compromises in the cheap iphone se design and construction this is not premium phone apples iphones are known for spend lot more for an iphone if you dont want to be discriminated by the richer iphone owners who will most likely call you pretentious trying hard social climber who wants to blend in with them that or just buy better more premium android phone theres plenty of excellent choices for that asking price of the iphone se buying the iphone se is like buying sony lcd tv instead of an alternative uhd tv from other less known tv brands that cost the same buying it just because you must have sony brand name rather than devant skyworth tcl or hisense in your tv
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),not wifi it is equipped with wifi
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),they didnt count display resolution as cons very bad gsmarena
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),was considering this phone but was suspecting the battery will be disaster unfortunately the review proves it is indeed
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),in europe one can buy samsung se for the same price would choose it any time of day instead of the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),finally received mine have it on the smart battery case and man does the battery drain fast went from to in hours using the smart battery case on my iphone pro lasts from to in hours with the same usage am just talking about the smart battery case percentage if am correct add times the hours when adding the phones battery had better battery life with the same smart battery case using my iphone dont see this phone as an all day travel phone still love it though but barely gets through work day
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple sell worst battery life that lose to iphone while retain the same design scr more lol doubt youve ever been close to an iphone if you say this for many this is the perfect phone with the best support in the industry and ios is starting to tempt me to move over to apple hardware
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),in other words apple will never sell tech garbage like many android oems apple sell worst battery life that lose to iphone while retain the same design screen and camera
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),seems lot of people doesnt like big screen anymore and suddenly they like big bezel
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),there are some good looking android phones at the same price range as the se but think after year or so will be too slow to use or if usable the overall feeling will be on the negative side the iphone se has outdated looks but it looks nonetheless beautiful and more premium than most androids at that price but find the an irresistible offer considering that fact that it faster than some top end phones know the choice is hard but think no other phone will last as long as the iphone se and still performs fast like to hold on my phone for as long as it still fast enough to use and think only the iphone can offer that so for me at least the se is the best can get to last for years
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),if only it has inch screen and bigger battery like mah which phone has mah
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),endurancei dont need to read more go back and read again its hrs
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),meh thought this could be good alternative for android except for that year phone battery life feel bad for apple fans buying this will have to carry chargerspower banks with them
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),you dnt bcouse you have xiaomi redmi ak with bloatware junk and cheap plastic body pretty more xiaomiredmi phones around the same price as the iphone se are the also made from glass and metal have similar performance have twice the battery endurance and pack in other niceties too like notchless displays and headphones jacks not sure what youre on about
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),dat battery life is so much like decade ago when smartphones could do better than it
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),iphone surplus edition
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the specification of this phone does not meet my taste so let me stick with my android phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the perfect small compact mobile with decent specs and the first apple phone that would serio more good inspiration and very good comment on android oems both in favor of this masterpiece lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),with or not it will still sell like hot cakes waiting for sale numbers it will be hit think it certainly will be the best selling phone of apple quality build latest ios compact form factor excellent sound quality impressive camera performance and overall performance makes this phone unbeatable for given price and current situation in the world google pixel should cost at least less to be as attractive as iphone se
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),the camera is probably the best camera for its price range dont care if it only has one camera as long as it does good job this camera has ois which like and fast chip to process it better this phone beats out phones with multiple camera in the same price range
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),another disappointment from apple according to this review thanks apple but you are losing more your comment are funny since iphone se best rated phone in gsmarena
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),poormansocial climbers iphone lol better buy an iphone xr regardless of the specs especially the chipset cause in reality its just bit bump up the marketing side is just for the convincing part or iphone if you are into landscape photography and have good budget
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apple should be ashamed for selling phone with such bad battery life in
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),think only the buyers who want the apple logo in their phone for showing off will buy this the only positive can see in this is the powerful chip but what is the point of using it on this device think apple is not selling phones but their logo
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),am noticing only android fans here none of you is suitable to post comments yet since none of you tried to use this great cheap phone you want bigger screen buy other iphone model not everyone want to drag their tv with themselves most of your comments are about the battery like you are going to work on it which is stupid and last thing you are all forgetting to comment about the greatest thing about this phone what about the processor oh yeah it has the latest technology so please stop posting ridiculous comments
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),shockingly good rating ive expected worse will still insist on an xr or thanks tim apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),omg fair iphone se review that doesnt hail it as the second coming of christ well done gsmarena
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),lol at the reviewer trying to stick up for the battery life by calling hrs respectable ma more what do you mean by stamina king pixel has hours of endurance rating as compared to hours mind you that pixel is proper flagship whereas iphone se is budget and compact phone also compare the price agree iphone se has mediocre battery life but bashing repeatedly dont make it any better also apart from meh battery and old design it is as much good as flagship
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),not sure what it is but something about iphones intrigues me even knowing that its probably not the right ecosystem for me im also quite sure that would sorely miss the tall aspect ratio here you might call and taller stupid for media viewing but find it very nice for just about everything else
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),for that amount of money both vanilla obviously better on most aspects except of course performance on specsheet both phones still considered as compact in but if stuck in the ios world obviously theres no other choice lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),wow if your not going to include fast charger in the box at least put charger like normal human beings hmin to charge mah battery what is this
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),battery bezels ruined this phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),hr endurance rating if any android had battery life this pathetic it would be getting more sot pathetioc for low end crap gb ram mah battery for garbage
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),at least we got some fun
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),it is apples way of saying if we rebranded old devices people would still buy it why because people still think that apple is still better than other makers
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),like small phone like this but this phone not like what expected first issue which left me behind was the battery mah this isnot enough for the people in second issue is big bezels because now the trend is full display the notch on iphone or above are far greater than this phone my final decision is not to buy because battery life and design are not good in im looking forward to get an small iphone like this size with full display and indisplay fingerprint sensor
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),oh that battery life good for browsing only
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),apples products are counter productive they boast about years software support but then imagine having such tiny battery like this ageing for years then apple is gonna throttle the performance they boast about best processor performance but then majority of their users use it for tik tok imessage and facetime my god
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),year old design single camera system shitty os with restrictions uses recycled componentsshitty battery life and costs the same as oneplus in india its new wine in old bottle which any sensible man would straightaway refuse to buy
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),they say battery will last longer than iphone was hoping for hrs in gsmarena test this is no go for me now right now am using lite
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),if the screen was lil bit bigger atleast wouldve seriously considered it hope apple releases more phones like this in the future
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),weak battery plus obsolete and dated design pathetic
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),that bettery life though lmfao
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),battery make this phone dead on arrival
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),wow what terrible battery life this phone is ridiculous just buy used iphone for way lesssame phone you know you dont need an chip for display
Apple,iPhone SE (2020),hr endurance in is simply unacceptable irrespective of the price
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),got my iphone se in like new condition the other night no flaws and for only on more well said brother the only reason why im not too keen on this se is the screen resolution currently still use an plus red gb which bought back in but its starting to get bit dated as more and more apps require ios or later was hoping that apple would make an iphone with the plus bodyshell and updated internals someday but it looks like thats not going to happen unfortunately dont know what my next phone will be im not in rush to get new phone but know ill have to get one at some stage maybe itll be an iphone dunno
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the apple iphone se is the only current iphone model you can get today with the more haha old school the frames these days with the sharp edge used to be the way before the old school rounded frame came and took over
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),love this small beast for the nostalgia lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its great compact phone it just works well
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yes most iphone users dont like android anyway because it looks so cluttered so if you more less cluttered though if you consider nokia and occasionally lenovo
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the se is good size to fit in your pocket with years of updates and every other iphone waa more expensive than what wanted yet it has the chip and if was to get reasonable up to date android that is small without being the size of backpack you are looking at times or more the price of se fit into the dont need lot of frills category and dont want to live on the phone so no brick size for me and want to keep it for years battery life lasts day if you are not heavy user people are very precious now and expect everything from the world
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),newer soc also means better secure enclave features than nd gen se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),has this model feature allowing taking pictureselfie without touching phone some hand gesture voice recognition or something
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yes thats what am looking for dumb phone used only for verbal and text communication
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),phone camera apps download
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you mean the widget almost lost about of my inheritance funds to self acclaimed broker met through reddit and promised me of return on every of my investment including bonuses quickly invested cause was seeking financial freedom not knowing was only trying to enrich someone else was denied withdrawals after already invested demanding for more fees beforei could take out my profit and my capital then knew ive been cheated immediately came online to find an expert who deals with fund retrieval then found cryptoreversal atgmailcm who was able to get back my funds completely without hassle then got toknow legitimate recovery team still exist cause ive read reviews of the fake ones avoid been burnt again and get connected to michael now the best fund retrieval team
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why the hell no nubia red magic pro or lenovo legion in the performance compared charts here samsung galaxy phones are really slow come here too see if iphone se is faster and better at gaming than the very best android has too ofter instead see iphone se vs android slowest flagship phone with only mid range like performance
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),am sure that the people who buy this wont be buying it for gaming it is targeted at more yes
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),for tasks that make use of larger screen such as gaming browsing the web and reading long texts find the larger iphones just not large enough so this little iphone makes lot of sense if you intend to have an ipad for these uses
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),maybe to get hardware upgrade just like thermostat you wanna upgrade after time has passed ive been using android since the beginning for the past years ive found how to remove any google related software google sucks now be great wout the bs of google apples file structure is fabulously awesome ppl dont like change but sometimes its good thing now if people would start using linux or ubuntu os for there computer they would be lot happier
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone se buyer will never consider zenfone yes most iphone users dont like android anyway because it looks so cluttered so if you like zenfone go for it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and the battery percentage has been moved permanently here because there is no room left for more am using the iphone se after trading in the model at istore the battery percentage button in the settings under battery is still there and you can use it to switch it on or off it seems that your phone has got problem or you did not set it up correctly this iphone se is fantastic in terms of performance and is very portable the battery life is even far better than for iphone once charged lasts me almost two days with moderate to heavy use
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it is literally the same phone even the color options are identical that is not true the midnight is slightly blue instead of blackgrey the starlight is somewhat yellowish instead of whitesilver raw aluminum and the red is deeper preferred the se especially the white which much reminded me of the iphone the se had the iphone xr colors and the se has the iphone colors
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),give me one good reason why normal person not power user will want to upgrade from se more maybe to get
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no matter how good you are to them it doesnt mean that they will treat you the same way have been married to my wife for years with no idea she was cheating suddenly started noticing changes in behavior suspected something was wrong so confided in friend who convinced and introduced me to remotespytech he was able to hack into my wifes mobile phone text messages call logs ig browser history deleted messages emails and whatsapp it seemed as though my life was spinning out of control getting to find out she has someone else filed for divorce just could not continue with lies if you feel you are been exploited in your marriage and you need proof suggest you contact remotespytech gmail com reach him for your spy and hacking job and be free just like me today
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yeah it will but apple may cancel it just like rumors that the mini iphones will be cancelled more iphone se is currently being sold instock by carriers
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well mean if that is within your financial means then more power to you im more of one more yeah it will but apple may cancel it just like rumors that the mini iphones will be cancelled but its just rumors
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yeah people who arent enthusiast but just need smartphone that works listen my who more well mean if that is within your financial means then more power to you im more of one phone type of guy can get on with either android or ios equally well just not simultaneously it seems and im not going to disregard what you say about the se not being good deal with caveats though there is certainly better value to be had elsewhere if considering hardware and specs alone but for its target market if those customers are coming from say an or earlier do not want to spend more than they have to and are not interested the newer design philosophy then these people are in all likelihood not going regret picking up this device since there is large enough demographic out there to support such market and apple can produce such device without having to worry about competition then the se line will continue
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no it isnt and sorry but somebody whos felt the need to purchase two of the premier and mos more yeah people who arent enthusiast but just need smartphone that works listen my whole point is that the se is not good deal but that doesnt mean people wont still buy itcause its apple anyways and the reason why have two expensive phones is beacuse love both android and ios and need the best of both worlds
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),know people like that for one just go to store and ask for apples latest iphone and bu more no it isnt and sorry but somebody whos felt the need to purchase two of the premier and most expensive smartphones on the market isnt really going to understand the point ive been making you are obviously smartphone enthusiast there is no other reason anybody would believe it necessary to simultaneously own both an iphone pro and galaxy ultra well other than being professional tech reviewer of course but the target audience for the se is the exact opposite to you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),regardless of which device they are coming from im not sure can provide you with good more know people like that for one just go to store and ask for apples latest iphone and buy iti am currently using the pro nd ultra but still they will always see options its inevitable
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this phone reminds me of the harley davidson bike one of my friends had for few years he had to stop and fill up the tank every km the motorcycle was more expensive than any other brand but it was harley davidson and that was all that mattered
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),my apologies as dont quite get your post here do you mean to say that no other brand more yes thats truei agree answered me right
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),difference to be sure and you wouldnt be incorrect doing so the irony here is that if appl more give me one good reason why normal person not power user will want to upgrade from se to se hell even from an old iphone the only way that is possible is if the person is unaware of options and come on people around always know when want to upgrade ur smartphone so advice and options is certain
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont understand in one post you say this phone is disaster due to battery life the more thats why emphasized on being deep in the apple ecosystemnot caring about battery life can still find the se in and the is not super huge from the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),deleted post true
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),which android manufacturer could create such smartphone with such body would love new updated phone with the bodydesign of edge se note plus etc
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its back to the past
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),true the zenfone is million times better if asus sell service it in your country more iphone se buyer will never consider zenfone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),as if apple discontinuing model means it no longer exists lol you can buy it more sure market dependent im not going to bother going over what ive already said though and why does everyone fell the need to stick lol at the end of everything these days are you really all that easily amused
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),zenfone ram dump issues were blown completely out of proportion and while asus did poorly co more true the zenfone is million times better if asus sell service it in your country heck id go as far to say that even the se nd hand ofc is better deal overall superior display wider colour options more and arguably similar cameras mm hp jack microsd slot usb and better battery life etc
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery performance poor
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery performance
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),recommending the zenfone with its ram dumps and nonexistent customer support lawl zenfone ram dump issues were blown completely out of proportion and while asus did poorly communicate it that is pretty much the only issue that existed since got mine one other did too but that was on the android beta so nothing the normal customer would have issues with also customer support isnt that bad they react quickly in the forums and asus phone service is pretty good unless youre in third world country guess the phone itself is superior in pretty much every way sure it wont get updates for as long but other than that it wipes the floor with the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the version currently costs for this one considering the minimal upgrades more difference to be sure and you wouldnt be incorrect doing so the irony here is that if apple were still offering the version at discounted price then thats what the target audience would probably go for anyway but apple have discontinued it and as said before the type of customer this device is aimed towards is looking for minimal fuss during the whole process of securing new iphone that means quick trip to their local apple store or phone dealership the murky waters of the used smartphone market are likely going to be just too much hassle for such people to willingly navigate and that time will be better spent doing anything else other than looking up smartphone specs and pondering over used handset conditions this se as with its predecessor is for the person who frankly just doesnt give sht about all this smartphone stuff they have an old iphone and want new iphone and they dont want to spend any more time or money than they absolutely have to in order to get one
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),pls word of advice but if anybody that is invested in apple ecosystem and doesnt care ab more dont understand in one post you say this phone is disaster due to battery life then in another suggest people should instead look to the sewhich has even worse battery life the se is no longer being sold by apple and you are not going to save life changing money by considering it on the second hand market as for the iphone that is physically much larger device that doesnt appeal to all look this is going round in circles now but just understand this people on here can post all day long about how they think the se should be avoided but you are talking to no one as the kind of customer who is likely to consider it wouldnt be reading site like this in the first place
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),can say this support speech to an android because if an android brand did this it would be more my apologies as dont quite get your post here do you mean to say that no other brand could ever release device like this se one that seems on paper to be so behind the times if so then fully agree with you they could not this however being primarily down to fact that not only are android oems facing the uphill battle of trying to coax users away from apple but they also have the added burden of competing with other android producing brands in short if you want to use android then you have to choose between plethora of different devices from competing brands each trying desperately to get you to decide their own particular take on an android device is where you should be looking to put your money however if person is ios all the way then its apple or nothing this gives apple the freedom to produce device like the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why to what end ton of costly rd purchasing of new components and retooling assemb more can say this support speech to an android because if an android brand did this it would be crucified
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),right if by research you mean some simply go off their prior experience look you seem to more pls word of advice but if anybody that is invested in apple ecosystem and doesnt care about bells and whistles then the best offer is seexcept its out of stockwhich dont think yet even the iphone is there the thing is the se made sense this one doesnt make sense
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),whatever always stars
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),answer his question dont go off topic he spoke off truth indenial at its finest he basically insinuates im some dumb child and you demand give him the time of day dont need to justify his bad attitude with response thank you im in my and have children of my own one of which has the se and is very happy with it when this person learns to grow up and talk like somebody over the age of ill treat them as such till then they can jog on
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cost mainly but also as has been pointed out here repeatedly but some still somehow fail to more true
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),we can discuss whos dumb or not when you learn how to spell properly kiddo until then som more answer his question dont go off topic he spoke off truth indenial at its finest
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thats the questionwhat parent is stupid to get iphone for their children with such poo more we can discuss whos dumb or not when you learn how to spell properly kiddo until then something about those in glass houses not throwing stones comes to mind
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),even the iphone mini is better than this why and who would want this over mini cost mainly but also as has been pointed out here repeatedly but some still somehow fail to grasp there are those out there that even now prefer the older design
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its rubbish battery life is very short and it is not recommended to buy absolutely true better off with mini
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),argue what simply explained to you how people do when they want to buy something not trivia more right if by research you mean some simply go off their prior experience look you seem to have trouble grasping this very simple concept so ill go back to my original points and dont worry ill try to make them as clear as possible for you the se is not repeat not aimed at those who frequent sites like this neither is it for anyone who wants hrr displays multi cameras or the has the slightest inclination to look through plus android options that all sound to such person like they pretty much do the same thing anyway it is for somebody who is familiar with ios invested in that ecosystem but doesnt care for all the bells and whistles of the latest and most expensive top of the range iphone models they just want something that will allow them to continue to use imessage facetime use safari to browse the web link with their apple watch if they have one and all that apple stuff they know and trust you can ramble on to this person about the motorolas the or so xiaomis or the dozens of samsungs and so on for as long as you are willing to waste your own time once they learn it doesnt do what they know how the way they know how they will loose interest then and there parents who use the ios ecosystem and want to get their children iphones at as little cost as possible in order to share their investment in said system are another good example or those wishing to get their elderly parents phone for the same reasons being another for such people the se will be just fine for everyone else by all means shop around
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its interesting that for years the android faithful nonstop on this site have been arguing th more argue what simply explained to you how people do when they want to buy something not trivial people who walk into phone shop and say that they want to buy specific phone are people who did some research regardless of whether they call it that or not
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),not necessarily it could just mean you have need for it bought toaster the other week more people who are interested to buy phones dont necessarily visit websites specially for phone reviews but its very unlikely that they buy phones blindly people dont walk into phone shop and tell the seller to give them any phone they just dont do that if they do that the seller will try to sell them the most expensive phone or the phone that is the most profitable for them to sell its very normal that they will do some research most people dont call it that but that doesnt matter maybe by searching online reading user reviews checking average user ratings or asking their friends or their family members people are interested in specs even though they may not call them specs for example when people want to buy tv two specs they are interested in are the screen size and picture quality they can judge the picture quality by seeing it themselves regarding phones the screen size and battery life are among the first things people are interested in when they want to buy phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well we cant all be as smart as you like to think you are now can we and apparently ha more dont understand what you mean if you want to buy phone or any product it means that youre interested in it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),all youre saying is that the target audience will blindly buy this despite being terrib more youd be amazed at how many people still prefer this design and touch id over the new designs with face id
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),quick comparison to the iphone battery life stats on gsma says otherwise hr more browsin more id take gsmarenas battery stats with grain of salt to be honest they once praised the galaxy ss battery life and wellthey were somewhat off base on that one can tell you as for all those points you mention yeah you could waffle on about them for as long as you liked to the target audience for the se you only end up achieving two things you bore the pss out of said se perspective buyers and you waste however much time it takes you to realise your wasting your time see they are most likely only going to be interested in one thing is it an iphone right after you say no youll have lost them now know what you are going to say something about them getting clue levelling up their tech game and going android etc oh youll be waxing lyrical about hrr and multi cameras and custom rooms and all that jazz all the while theyll have done that glazing over thing mentioned earlier and be stood there hoping youll finally just give it rest at some point those to whom the se sounds like good deal just arent interested in the stuff you are going on about not really sure why that is so hard to understand they want an iphone as cheap as possible simple as so cant you just be happy with convincing yourself that they have made mistake going for the se and you have somehow actually achieved something buying an android
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),after seeing the battery life test results nothing else needs to be said you really have to more youtube battery tests showed battery life on par or slightly better than iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ommmgghh again apple iphone and milions comments like why what is so interesting about this phone from year
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),exactly man if only samsung could take this note from apple instead of removing jack sd car more your probably not going to like me for this but was always fan of the earlier galaxy series used and loved all phones from the original to the fell out of love when the dismal hit the stores now did continue to buy at least one versions of all the series right up to the just always ended up quickly returning them after the something had changed all that being said an fe style device based around something like the with the latest snapdragon or exynos could be interesting just not sure how much of market there would be for it given the plethora of choice in the android mid range the se doesnt really have to compete with anything else in the ios space know there are those saying to get the xr or or one of the minis etc but that entails either higher cost or going second hand the target audience for the se are probably looking to walk into their local phone dealership and walk out with something as similar as possible but new they are probably not interest by being bamboozled with ton of alternatives the details of which will bore them senseless neither are they likely to want to take the risks and uncertainties associated with the second hand market let alone the time it takes to find good deal no they just want to walk in to that dealership hold up their current iphone say give something as close to being this but new then pay for it and walk out asap in order to get on with their day this is who the se is for its not designed to win over the android faithful that was never its purpose
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),love all the this is just an iphone with new chip and oh the battery life wont some more all youre saying is that the target audience will blindly buy this despite being terrible value and pretty outdated outside off the new chip well you prove everyones point this is phone bought without any research
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lol no you have iphone for that better everything even iphone xr will still receive upd more yep xr overall better choice
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),bro physical touch id is better than any under display one those are just for smaller bezels more touchid is slow inaccurate and does not work with wet fingers because apple uses still the same ancient technology as the first time they introduced it any under display reader works better and especially has no problem with wet fingers use both so know by myself not just reading about it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),redmi will blow any flagship this year very poor choice of words lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),price tag for this phone is fine considering the tiny but major updates dont forget that this phone is gonna last you for atleast years this phone has separate audience which some people dont seem to realise and complain about it being the worst phone but yeah in countries like india where the price tag is above its not worth it even for the audience of this phone is specific
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),deleted post seriously why do you think anyone cares that you have an iq of
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),we already have winner in the category worst smartphone worst battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),huawei nova is better thn this and cheaper nova is garbage and has no gms get the samsung as should be discounted well by now
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),know right under display scanners are still pretty useless love these gsm arena idiots more lol just go to another website if you want to bash gsmarena
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),they both use the same old sensors and same lenses which is probably the reason why they dont get night mode despite the vast amounts of processing power available thats wrong the reason is that this isnt apples flagship
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),imagine getting this or the edge pro gt pro pro sfe etc for similar price in india lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well the design is really outdated so are many specs and features for one thing the te more bro physical touch id is better than any under display one those are just for smaller bezels just like under display camera less bezel and less quality
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),se is still the best compact phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),absolutely no idea how youve given the device anything over youve literally only listed negatives in your conclusion positive of group of people wanting the cheapest iphone which isnt positive by the way even showing the for essentially being problem but you just sweep all that under the rug and give it crazy youll happily rate android phones with lets be honest better all round specs and features yet get and similar poor marks yet being of the price of the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the heat is willing ios but the body so out dated cannot
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),on basics the most powerful single core soc helps you keep the battery more stable for instant more so se has basics how bizzare you guys can swooping
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the minimum brightness we captured at point white was nits an impressive one for an lcd screen gsmarena you have bad continuity sometimes apart from picture scenes feel you guys dont remember patterns well in how displays perform from time to time in your reviews minimum nits is actually very unimpressive for an lcd panel your very own reviews have objectively shown that lcd panels have the lowest nits brightness the realme measures nits and overall lcd panels youve reviewed mostly hit nits and under this is given because lcd isnt calibration nightmare like oled
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),for some people is all they need and even more for me that dont like android and have never bought one is better than any android
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),had the se and the mini prefer the size and shape of the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),now youre getting ridiculous find me phone with chip ok fairer request more dont want pseudo nm chop which dont last half day use
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),aside from pure performance standpoint iphone se is still worse than galaxy released more so hows ur
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),phone thats simply terrible but is still being defended by its fans if you want an apple phone get mini or an iphone you can even get an se if you want an apple that badly but this phone is just not it and dont get how people can defend it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),better than redmi note pro also better than upcoming redmi note series to be announc more are you really comparing specs besides chip everything is literally big flop comparing to redmi
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),all those drawbacks and with that terrible endurance this still got stars come on gsmarena it got two extra stars to not have to deal with apples fanboys yes this is terrible device in im sure few will buy it though just like few would buy refresh of sgs with snapdragon series but come on just buy second hand iphone pro max or instead
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),aint buying this shit even for dollars lol reminds me of my friend using iphone with his power bank lol and those bezels this is apple not pls apple fanboys will still buy this pos not my cup of tea lol iphone with there overrated shit yet again if love apple and wants to join there ecosystem just get the older iphones like mini or even the original iphone se cheaper and better not sticking with crappiphones tho so goodluck
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont think the battery has improved lot last time also se gave similar endurance rating
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),that battery life lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you people who are talking about resolution have never used these phones side by side there more use both and of almost the same size displays everyday the difference is pretty obvious
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so if you already have the apple power adapter or similar usbc pd one you should be fine only hardcore rapple fanboys have these as they dont give them away lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont be fooled by this crap if you still want iphone there are still cheaper and new iphone its probably hard to find but theres few in my country new not repaired for euro less even cheaper iphone xr and xs then you have iphone iphone and mini euro cheaper than this crap se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),interesting that your test shows no real battery improvement when others ive seen say that th more no no look again they show an overall hours improvements they even have the se for comparison
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this design was first introduced all the way back in when it debuted on the iphone it more you people who are talking about resolution have never used these phones side by side there is no quality difference they look the same which is good and the poi makes absolutely no difference
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),who needs powerful chip when battery drains quickly fans are clueless followers on basics the most powerful single core soc helps you keep the battery more stable for instant open please learn to think before you write
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this is becoming classic design for those who want the easiest smartphone to use
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no night mode at this age is such crap move whatever the reason budget be
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wonder why there are no or testsg is obsolete nowptobably turning on new se will smoke his battery in an hour
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why even bother to make this review really we all know what it is iphone with new chiptset not interesting at all
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lol and yet the fans will still praise it with world class chipset but weak screen battery more who needs powerful chip when battery drains quickly fans are clueless followers
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),actually nothing wrong with xiaomis software support or lack of it my mi max is stil more and you can tweak it with custom rom to get latest android
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),did you forget that game doesnt exist on app store anymore did you forget or not understand the reference to like the comment game like fortnite
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),crappymi note pro is widen your myopic mind and see the prices in asia the gb iphone sameedition is at least usd more expensive than the gb note pro in most asian countries unless you also failed math like your geography
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),xiaomi software support lol good luck with that actually nothing wrong with xiaomis software support or lack of it my mi max is still functioning well as my file downloading device act as my hotspot or emergency third backup phone when needed despite last security patch dated aug
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),welcome back the iphone with clear stock of housing frame and other
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),rip for people who are optimistic about new more power efficient chipset is jo more lol and yet the fans will still praise it with world class chipset but weak screen battery average consumer will prefer all around phone not this very unbalanced phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its good to know that the glass panels arent ceramic shield why is that good thing well glass is glass after all
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),imagine how the iphone se looks like are they still using it like this from and maybe more why not
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),all that power for hour sot max most likely less if push it with game like fortnite did you forget that game doesnt exist on app store anymore
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if they only waited couple more years to make se an xr with they wouldnt have looked this stupid pushing their luck with how well se performed
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),how can trust geekbench if it increase numbers on iphones and on antutu the iphones are lows than android flagship for me ended trusting geekbench results
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),sure you can expect that every game to come out in the next years will easily maintain the maximum quality and fps atleast watch some tests before you write review if you cant be bothered to do one yourself
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),terrible battery life another overpriced junk iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lmao nope this iphone se price is double that of redmi note series in my country while the on more crappymi note pro is
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),comically large spoon but replace the large with poor and replace the spoon with battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),outdated design lack of any major upgrades expect the chipset the chipset upgrade is more xiaomi software support lol good luck with that
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),looks kinda cool and retro like it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),looks like the the phone escaped from the museum
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),small screen lcd weak battery life better go to android side than this outdated phone looks
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone mbps galaxy mbps
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone iphone iphone iphone iphone se iphone se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),that endurance rating oh my god it might as well be landline
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so you criticize it for not having the thing that it doesnt need to have high refresh rate but you didnt put the pathetic battery life in the cons also its not that of positive thing to be mentioned of course the soc doesnt throttle much since its downclocked version otherwise the battery life would be half of that
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the bezels the battery lifeits all just not bad just horrible value you have to really love ios to like this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it had potential but that battery life is un acceptable
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),sabir sep presently im using iphone all white color device from rd march my device is still more dude what do emean iphone se is so easy to find they are going tfor less than half the price because people are addicted to bug phones so these ones get big discount
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),presently im using iphone all white color device from rd march my device is still fresh and looks like new one as im using this device my secondary phone my main phone is samsung ultra when my iphone will expire im planning to buy iphone se product red model as feel that it has the same uniqueness as iphone all white colour both are very rare to find in hand at present
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),was worried about me getting it must swear its one of the best device that ive ever bought so far
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),phoneandcarguy aug its alright but the homebutton will make you think it is iphone or someting but with more the simple home button with touch id is nice though like it my iphone plus wouldnt be the same without it dont know if itll be easy or hard for me to adjust when finally get new iphone im thinking of maybe getting an iphone next year and this phone has the apple bionic which is probably fair bit better than the apple bionic in the plus
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its alright but the homebutton will make you think it is iphone or someting but without the apple bionic chip it will have low sales
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),your image view nowadays is garbage can not zoom in high definition as before cant even flip it from under instead browser scrolls up thought its my phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it can but not always even perfect phone is not always perfect on one side it can be perfect more righteo
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so theyre not the same thing ones perfect spaceship and ones best of manufacturer flags more it can but not always even perfect phone is not always perfect on one side it can be perfect for on other side it can be perfect in everything also many flagships are best from manufacturer but are not suitable for or are worse then competition
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yes spaceship is perfect phone flagship is something currently best of manufacturer so theyre not the same thing ones perfect spaceship and ones best of manufacturer flagship cant phone be both
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so spaceship and flagship are two different things yes spaceship is perfect phone flagship is something currently best of manufacturer
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no but performance yes so spaceship and flagship are two different things
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),flagship lol no but performance yes
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),switch to android for has poco pro which is spaceship for this flagship lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),problem will be as long as apps stop working at your iphone ios is far different from android for now many apps stops working on older models for example ios and many apps already dont work on those versions so as long your iphone gets oldes sooner or later many apps will stop working and since se has the well this iphone will last longer
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),managed to understand what he was saying heres translation in english looki more yes version is here its the
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),pro it has faster soc thats why spaceship minimum gb memory minimum gb ram more yeah probably should consider android but im so used to ios now and its all ive used too may not like android compared with ios cant afford to buy new phone outright at this point in time eventually ill more or less have to say goodbye to my plus
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),or pro and what do you mean its spaceship you mean like its really advanced and stuf more pro it has faster soc thats why spaceship minimum gb memory minimum gb ram ufs lpddrx ram mah battery charging speedhz screen with dolby vision and hdr plus android upgrades and years of security patches it is also ip sertified and version with gb can be found for maybe camera is better on iphone but thats it should consider android definitely
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),suppose its alright if you prefer smaller phones and dont mind having lower resolution more switch to android for has poco pro which is spaceship for this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),poorly made hahhahahaha lol thats the point of this phone its supposed to be cheap and works as phone nothing else and yk what it works as phone surprised
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),disagree with all lmao most of what stated were basic specifications that this more what mean by poorly made and want sd card slot why comment on an iphone they never had it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),performance is useless when everything else sucks its poorly made just hd lcd screen more poorly made hahhahahaha
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),nobody can even comprehend what mess of comment you just wrote managed to understand what he was saying heres translation in english looking forward to the se but expecting the usual poor battery and laughably small screen it really should be priced at hopefully version will finally have proper inch screen which is the minimum size needed even for compact phone now
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),bring on se awful battery size screen joke lol phone they will get right scre more nobody can even comprehend what mess of comment you just wrote
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),best sensible phone you could buy get it while you can apple wont be this sensible going forward
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its extremely seamless today unlike years ago you can use airdrop with nearby sha more dont know bro but wont lose lot of my apps if move to android have about apps on my plus at the moment
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),youre probably right but switching from iphone to android and vice versa is not seamless is more its extremely seamless today unlike years ago you can use airdrop with nearby share use the prospective brands file transfer app samsungs smart switch shareit use your icloud account on both devices bluetooth works only on handful of android devices effectively especially nokia devices due to eu legislations or use lightening to thunderbolt usb typec cable most effective of all the above
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you might as well get the nokia xr which is one of the last massmarket consumer phones wit more youre probably right but switching from iphone to android and vice versa is not seamless is it like when went from my plus to my plus it was seamless everything transferred over via bluetooth
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the gb version fills up very fast one hour of kfps video takes up about gb of space on this phone and then you are sol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this is great for secondary phone and use this and also pro max as well like how comfo more actually have ultra ive got almost all the great specs mobile can provide except the bulky body consider buying this se for its handiness and processor speed besides to get the chance to live in two kingdoms android and ios
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ill also be saying goodbye to the full screen of my plus apple should make an iphone thats full screen by using an underdisplay camera and they should also add touch id underdisplay or to the power button other phones have these features come on apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),please dont even think about such upgrade owned se for months and more thanks for your advice yeah im gonna stay with my plus for now ill possibly get an se and finally say farewell to the home button and touch id ill guess ill get used to it and if not well dont really have choice in the future
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ill need to upgrade from my iphone plus at some stage but if get an se like this one ill more please dont even think about such upgrade owned se for months and then sold it replaced battery in plus and still using plus now so what can say about se pros works really fast latest updates for ios new functionalities for system and all aplles apps so for example books app has new features really liked better photo and video quality gps works faster and more accurate better gsm connection for real have bad signal on subway with plus se is better handy size light weight cons terrible battery hours on cellular network hours on wifi and mostly use cellular so charging it twice day no heavy usage btw small screen gave me eye strain hard to read text because of small screen some apps are uncomfortable to use for example navigation apps phone got heat so stay with plus wait for se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this phone genuinely is the worst phone you could get for the price
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yes think its good upgrade cause it will get updates until and you could get hrs sc more note apple doesnt officially promise software support periods unlike most other oems that said they do have decent history of long software support for older phones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dxearthling nov currently have an iphone xr gb and im thinking to switch it up for this one by the end more yes think its good upgrade cause it will get updates until and you could get hrs screen time before it dies
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),previously used iphone mini loved the design and the battery life but the camera wasnt good as it was supposed to be and found it hard to use thats why was using an android phone as my main phone back then but android phones are so hit and miss then bought nd gen se for about and it was super easy to use however with battery health already at wasnt good enough as daily driver then swapped out with brand new se rd gen battery is actually great camera is great enough and no glitches like lagging or overheating it goes easy whole day and do play game check facebook regularly on internet and check many youtube videos those days dont watch youtube videos it lasts days all did when set it up were to turn optimised battery charging on close all apps when not in use and leave the blightness about battery health is still at after months
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),currently have an iphone xr gb and im thinking to switch it up for this one by the end of the year gb it is actually good idea
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why budget phone should have bad battery this is dumb and inacceptable for phone in they need to make iphone se at least inch and with at least mah battery and for shipset its ok to put older ones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why must you commenters use the wordliterally so much use what word
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),im not old and wouldnt say need touch id ive just always had the home button so guess more use samsung galaxy core years old midranger switch from samsung galaxy even years old midrange android smartphone model had trendy super amoled with inch hd not even fhd aspect ratio large but not large as smartphone nowadays mah battery and mp camera
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),camera on se has same quality as the but lacking night mode hdr which is unique compared to iphone with the old hdr battery is very efficient due to nm processor ios extra gb ram for multitasking and photograpic styles with portrait
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),good for months then said screw you speaker breaking noises also gets hot while gaming
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),has iphone outdated design which is barely different from the iphone has iphone more im not old and wouldnt say need touch id ive just always had the home button so guess like it rather than need it ive only had two iphones so far though plus and an plus havent really tried using the newer iphones so dunno if id miss having the home button or not
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its technically an iphone mini in an iphone body has iphone outdated design which is barely different from the iphone has iphone terrible display lcd hz tiny inch display not even fhd the worst screen of any phone of the market by far and its not even comparison has iphone terrible battery the worst battery of any phone by far has iphone terrible camera setup mp main camera mp selfie camera and not even ultrawide camera is the biggest joke for phone the only thing that shares with the iphone mini is the bionic which is easily the best chip in phones but even then you cant do too much with that terrible screen and that terrible battery the iphone se is by far the worst value for money phone that exists right now except for the chip everything of this phone is way worse than any android phone supposedly this phones niche is for old people that need touch id but literally any modern android phone has fingerprint sensor and face recognition if you need it even in low end phones and some of them have better fingerprint sensor than the iphone se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),have this model too the battery is very bad
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),new its basically an iphone with more mah and better chip its technically an iphone mini in an iphone body
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),name an android that has this performance with this price pixel
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),think space isnt big deal because it is the cheapest phone with this chip bionic so if more pls can the iphone se download up to apps in and will there be space remaining fo pictures and videos
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),bought mine from fb marketplace for pesos battery is not that bad mine last day with remaining battery health is at
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),still iphone se was the most popular apple knows how to keep its home button legacy but using the same model from the previous is something else looks like car which got modified hence making the power level stronger
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),purchased this phone new week ago the one major issue have noticed personally is that more have this model too dont have this problem but the battery is very bad the interface is slow like all iphones ios is inconvenient if you need something more than just calls and browser id rather buy the oneplus
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lol youre comparing with non true tone and true tone display true tone adapts to your more no not at all had true tone completely switched off on the rd gen the screen on the st gen is better in my opinion except the size which is definitely too small for me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),love the same thing love the fact we waited years for this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wouldnt mind if they kept this design around for another or even more years its comfortable and light design and fits in the hand perfectly after the se that looks like is out they could keep this as lower price option like ipad when ipad was announced then just update the internals soc ram storage every now and then while lowering the price make it like muscle car classleading performance in retro design
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thanks interesting compared the screen against my st gen se by putting both phones sideb more lol youre comparing with non true tone and true tone display true tone adapts to your surroundings making display colors look warm and cool randomly
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),checking in after years this device is pretty solid gb is too low for base storage wo more think space isnt big deal because it is the cheapest phone with this chip bionic so if want one with the power but different space buy the gb one it is avalible and there is gb too
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),interesting my screen looks too blue with true tone disabled id suggest comparing it more thanks interesting compared the screen against my st gen se by putting both phones sidebyside on the settings menu with white theme enabled the st gen actually looks slightly more yellow like this whereas the rd gen has very noticeable reddish hue the weird thing is when return to the homescreen the st gen se looks far more natural and clearer it doesnt look yellow hardly at all whereas the rd gen has very noticeable yellowreddish tint to the colours the st gen feels easier to look at and less straining on the eyes ill see if can find another rd gen in the store to compare it to
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),also notice the screen on my se has yellowreddish hue to the colours even with true to more interesting my screen looks too blue with true tone disabled id suggest comparing it to other iphones if you can find someone with another iphone or live display model in store it sounds bit like bad screen or maybe the color temperature of your st gen se is very very cold and youve simply gotten used to that
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),think nokia is the best phone ever jk lol too bad we need to point it out on apple more because the market is full of alternatives and the nokia has comparable camera hardware with higher resolution display etc its available at fraction of the price of this and nearly better in every aspect its compelling option to those who love this design and dimensions and not many people take their phone underwater there isnt anything to justify this phone and being interested in ios devices only isnt an excuse to purchase this over every phone available at this price in any market simple
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),youre better off with nokia instead same camera optics better display similar or more think nokia is the best phone ever jk lol too bad we need to point it out on apples comment thread where people asking for help which iphone to buy guy is obviuosly interested in ios devices so why bring an android device like nokia dont get it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),im planning to buy its phone hows its battery backup low lig more youre better off with nokia instead same camera optics better display similar or better camera performance far better design smaller bezels louder speaker and far cheaper the only reason why love this rather mediocre applebranded huaqin product is none other than its design because always prefer displays to tall giraffes spamming the database daily
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ive been using it for almost year now bt never had such always heating issues yeah somet more
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),can confirm overheating in basic tasks battery life is terrible using cellular gg network more ive been using it for almost year now bt never had such always heating issues yeah sometimes it would get hot bt never for always or for unknown reasons even in mobile data battery life is actually bad in ios ive to agree in ios and early it was best do miss ios and battery backup
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),probably got an iphone sold as se no iphone but se shaped
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),challenge you to find an ipad mini with gb buy mini
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),still cant reach all four corners its possible for me to do just not very comfortable but on other phones its impossible without serious phone juggling and hand gymnastics using taller screen like iphone with one hand would be fine if ui elements that need interaction were always or at least most of the time at the bottom within reach but neither apples ios nor apps or websites are there yet
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone se when you can actually reach all four corners of the display while holding it with more still cant reach all four corners
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),got iphone se because prefer touch id and because it is in my opinion the most comf more you probably bought it refurbished by amateurs
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),se rd generation for me love it my hands are really small and fit in my hands the performance is great and it runs genshin at high settings and ive never liked the notch especially how the newer notch is literally taller than the older one which gives me ocd the battery is also way better in se compared to se and speed is also generations ahead vs bionic chip even pro max and standard has same chip
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),garbage cant cope and paste text overheating alone freez almost all the time got more how exactly does that happen is it new or refurbished it has the same performance as the iphone pro
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),your iphone is outdated too for you can buy good mid range android phone or secc more dont reply to them they are just blind people that blames someone saying that iphone wasnt their cup of tea no matter how you told them they dont even mind if they infringe the rules
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),outdated design your iphone is outdated too for you can buy good mid range android phone or seccond hand flagship
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),please do not buy mediocre charging speed slow wifi bad battery problem
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the bad outdated design mediocre rear camera poor battery life the okay decent selfie more outdated design
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont screen is too small want to say something but rules prevent me from saying that something
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),which phone phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the person wants small phone and you say they should not buy it because it is too small do more want small phone boi
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),im not mobile gamer and love small phones with great specs planning to buy new phone th more dont screen is too small
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),got one with bh now its at and on ios this phone is heatfest ht gets too hot
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),transferred from my iphone to this and liked that phone watch videos and play games and its very nice
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),just bought used unit in the productred color for looks like new except some minor scratches and its gb model love it so far
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),am very sure have an iphone and and that phone is very similar to mines but has
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),had this phone im getting new one for christmas its good tho especially on ios tho its extremly fast
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),og se beats the crap out of this shbox thing is fast as hll on ios tho
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont agree with tablet choice ipad mini gb would suffice well challenge you to find an ipad mini with gb
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),havent seen physical home button for long time on phones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),they already did all ses gone out of stores dropping teabags and pills is the new norm more what do you mean you can still buy it from the apple site
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hope apple never discontinues the se series its not good for heavy user but my mai more they already did all ses gone out of stores dropping teabags and pills is the new normal they even dropped one on macbook with inch screen with bezels the agenda here is clear sho sum lve for big bro watchin ya
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),peace deal team iphone se as daily driver galaxy core as backup and radiomp player more dont agree with tablet choice ipad mini gb would suffice well
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),only if apple make iphone xr clone and call it se then will take that as success please more just buy used iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this seems like the most doably priced phone in the apple series for its value
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ios kill its battery the ios did not kill the battery in my iphone se please try and switch off background app refresh by going to settingsgeneralbackground app refresh also switch off wifi if you are not within wifi hotspot area if you leave the wifi on the battery drains while the phone searches for wifi signal to connect to good luck
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),se has become my favorite iphone of alltime just went back using it as my daily driver be more thanks as user and owner of the iphone se fully concur with the views expressed by you shared similar views about the battery efficiency portability functionality of the fingerprint reader turbofast performance etc for me the iphone se is the very best of the best compact phones on the market since it was launched hope that apple will maintain the production of this particular device
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),honestly love it the fact that this still looks like phone is something ive more se my dear
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),gave iphone chance again having loved but couldnt stand ios back then dont care about bezels not having them on previous android phones had little impact on my life really dont care how old the rest of this phone is all previous androids used had worse camera screen is perfect size making it perfect pocket smartphone cant make out the pixels couldnt care less and no my hands arent small theyre cm long aka huge love touch id wouldnt have gotten the phone otherwise anyways seems like will be going back to android once this dies and new ones wont be manufactured anymore finish my day with over of battery so if you dont live on your phone dislike phablets and require touch id this is could be the last best iphone for you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple doesnt even need to try people buy apple stuff
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),idk why everyone hates this phone atleast apple made cheap phone that everyone can afford because the only good thing is the bionic chip and everything else is trash mean lcd inches screen with hd screen hz old design with screen to body ratio battery that doesnt even last hours and gb base for in every country that isnt the usa phone chip but of everything else
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),first thise its not cheap phone and his specs are not value the battery have just more you are lucky if you poco get even one update
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the gap between flagships and midrange phones only gets wider an chip is nice but mah battery seriously
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if apple is going to go for budget iphone atleast make the bezels thinner because right now more id prefer an series phone that looks like the compared to what we have now smaller and lighter build aluminum frame easily outdoes the current
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it sounds like youre trying to find problem with carpenters hammer because it isnt sl more agree
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),my phone has problem with the proximity sensor it works slowly bought the phone new on does anyone else have this problem
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),batterie is jock
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),monster performance well the chip inside the iphone se may be performant but that weak batte more ios kill its battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it also depends on which citytown you are in and therefore which bands tmobile is usin more this should be posted and raised in all social media platforms like what the hell right
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),have no issue with whats going on it also depends on which citytown you are in and therefore which bands tmobile is using in that city town believe that when connected to mhz on tmobilled network its really an lte instead of despite being shown as this phone clearly doesnt have antenna lines on side of the phone like every other iphone has this phone clearly has issues when connecting to tmobiles mhz band anyway already know that no major tech site will cover this issues with this iphone they get paid by apple and therefore will not bring up any major issues that iphone might have again its perfect fast phone when connected to only but has undisputed issues with connecting to certain bands because of the lack of certain antenna strips that are suppose to be located on side of the phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the last good iphone when the next se no longer has home buttontouch id its over true
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wanna buy this se but im worried about battery drain and especially overheating when more mine only overheats if im using it while its on charge but thats given really had it over year and all good
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cant stop laughing xd this is the biggest absurdity of smartphone in the world histo more how so im glad they have smaller more basic phone with real home button as an option wouldnt buy any other iphone this one is perfect for my needs
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),se with bionic chip and can play genshin impact on high settings is bargain rn the only downside is the battery and the camera if youre into photography but if you use this phone on daily basis its fine but youll need power bank for extra measure hope in the future we can get se with iphone xr body
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the tap to wake feature should be available in the se as well whats wrong with you app more home button
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),which is best for few more years of usage se brandnew vs pro gb used bh sure new se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),se or samsung camera phones in term of photography and videography
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),think se will hold up very so recommend you to get se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),pray god they wont stop this series se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),got this small beast last thursday and its pretty awesome believe its the last se so you better have it for the nostalgia lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),we need an iphone se with iphone body accompanied with perfect lcd display waiting fo more well theres the iphone itself that can still be found new although the battery might have gotten weaker by itself the phone being around since and will get software updates only till from now
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),please advise iphone se or asus zenfone need small phone with monster performance monster performance well the chip inside the iphone se may be performant but that weak battery isnt going to let it perform for long have owned it for less than year and the battery is already noticeably downgraded if use it for forty minutes of browsing video watching and video call itll get very warm and the screen will force dim dont think its good design to have that chip in that chassis with that battery my previous iphone in its prime didnt have those issues im gonna sell the phone as for asus dont know
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),in apple land gets you very basic smartphone sure it was released with the latest chip inside but the darn weak battery doesnt let you perform but basic tasks throughout the day watch youtube browse twitter prepare yourself to charge the phone twice day ive had it for less than year and the battery is already noticeably downgraded and dont want to carry an extra external battery gonna sell it and get an iphone instead was even considering samsung to save money but dont want to go through the headache of finding the right apps all over again if the ones already have arent available on play store and perhaps what is free with limited features on apple store is paid on play store or contains ads also how would that phone perform with everyday use over time
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone se or iphone xr in need best advice se obviously
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),se is far better than xr
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),choose the os you prefer for battery life samsung but without lag choose iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hello everyone which is better samsung galaxy or iphone se choose the os you prefer
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),neither buy xiaomi or oneplus nord youll thank me later but if you must choose between the two id suggest the with caution it has the battery capacity much larger and higher res display more ram more storage in some aspects better camera and just overall more wellrounded the battery on this phone really is bs compared to the only problem is that think everyone here hates one ui it is notoriously buggy and stuttery and id also like to say that the chipset of the se is better vs score in antutu although both are enough for daytoday use and casual gaming just because of the display and battery id suggest you to pick up the
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you may use it even longer than the before because it wont get black spot as it is not oled agree the only thing miss is the double tap to wake up feature
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),did you replaced iphone battery in between no could have used the for another couple of years just exchanged it with the se se is good minimalistic everything want in my phone the best thing is it has fingerprint scanner the only thing miss is the double tap to wake up the screen feature
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thats lie im sure that you dont own se real sot is hours maximum more think you are talking about se with se you can get easily at least hr hr is my assumption draining last backup from if not doing heavy task normaltextingsocial media browsing and yt it can easily last up to hr at least idk why you are getting hr sot although still havent updated to latest ios and my bh is currently
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),tbh dont think its pathetic you cant expect pro max battery from small device more thats lie im sure that you dont own se real sot is hours maximum from to battery charge so dont spread misinformation
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),mine is coming today am changing my year old iphone to this one only because dropped more did you replaced iphone battery in between
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well tbh had iphone before along with my android phone poco and always loved how clea more mine is coming today am changing my year old iphone to this one only because dropped it on tar road and it got black spot on the top feel the spot is keep on spreading across did not want to spend lot of money so went for se im sure it wont disappoint me plan to use this for another years at least
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),how you liking the ecosystem vs android whats best feature in ios do miss these sizes more well tbh had iphone before along with my android phone poco and always loved how clean simple yet more intuitive ios is mean android is better if you are customization freak like using theme storelots of rd party appsroot and install custom rom and so on bt im the type of user who really wants clean simple ui with longer support mostly im using social mediataking some photos here there maybe play some games like efootballalso im student so cant buy new phone every now and then and dont get much free time also so the se seemed very neat option to me and it didnt disappoint me at all again its all about what type of user you are android is more independent but it is not like you cant find any apps that already in android play store bt not in appstore or you cant download anything you can still do those stuffs bt not the same way as android also sharing with shareit to android has made things more easier for me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),inch display in an iphone body would sell like crazy for apple if they go that route in
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),nah its not thats like size but not se might be worth waiting for looks
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),have come from android yet not having issues because love the smaller form factor how you liking the ecosystem vs android whats best feature in ios do miss these sizes wish android made another
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its too small it has good battery good processor everything okay but the size it hur more you need to get new glasses not as an insult but from experience thats the real issue and it will make daily life easier too
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and apple has cheek to ask haha ill give for it as spare phone bro im an android user myself but if you think that this is worth ur trippin it has last gen processor thats better then most phones and rlly good camera maybe its designed to be small so people who want smaller phone can buy it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you obviously cant read its just been explained and you dont even know what is tip more damn bro
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),is perfect nah its not thats like size but not
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),minimum screen these days is perfect
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),very nice but poor battery performance minimum screen these days
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why people are bashing phone lmao this is really good device that targets very specific more because we hate corp greed
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),very nice but poor battery performance for my day job
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),whats the battery like what do you use it for screen on time sorry use the version it has about screen on time
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),replaced with se its good same feeling just better whats the battery like what do you use it for screen on time
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),can this guy leave already im just interested in replacing my aging iphone with se more replaced with se its good same feeling just better
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),please my friends can buy this phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you obviously know nothing about smartphones you just see higher numbers and think thats better also ngl pretty toxic if you ask me saying that my paragraph was not based on numbers but on actual videos taken of said devices and numbers can be better if you had mb of ram and have gb of ram whos device is better
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you really hate this phone so much that you have to write comments about how much you hate more bro you cant even count not all of my replies are hate
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),st of all small screen my samsung has larger screen nd camera yet again my sa more you obviously know nothing about smartphones you just see higher numbers and think thats better
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what in the world do you even mean by stereo jack also im sure you can liv more headphone jack
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),larger screen and bigger camera resolution does not equal better image theres no way an more and better yet the resolution of the screen on the se is only how are you gonna see your image if you dont have the resolution to cope thats just space waster at least the does not go above its screen resolution camera screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),then name them dont see any crappy specs st of all small screen my samsung has larger screen nd camera yet again my samsung has higher resolution rd battery the battery is the equivalent of phone from bet samsung has bigger battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),his points are valid though this phone has some really crappy specs for phone then name them dont see any crappy specs
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hr sot lately
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),deleted post ok
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),nah flagships wont have these crappy specs other than the processor you really hate this phone so much that you have to write comments about how much you hate it get life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its flagship now nah flagships wont have these crappy specs other than the processor
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cant help but wonder why model iphone have lcd display the lcd here is goodquality one
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no card slot and no stereo jack means no deal what in the world do you even mean by stereo jack also im sure you can live with gb its big enough to suit most normal people
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),had it felt like it was yr sold lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it should be illegal to sell phone with battery this awful in hours of sot maybe more bezels bigger than jay leno
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well thik the battery capacity would just be mah so as to march its year of release
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no its not the chip is underclocked because the mah battery cant handle all more copium
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),fake no its not the chip is underclocked because the mah battery cant handle all the power from the bionic chip the battery life is still pretty trash and besides im pretty sure you dont own the actual phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so just got this phone today since lost my pro after drunken night and must say have missed the size of smaller iphone hope the battery will be good enough for me or else will just buy battery cover since the phone is so small dont think it would make it to big anyway and since it got the it is bit faster than my pro dont mind not having ht enewest camera since it got decent camera for everyday use
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you sure you ever used the same iphone for more than two years yea years to be precise
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),bro its underclocked fake
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no actually its not and every single review in the world proves it some reviews are done by some people who actually dont own particular device and makes false reviews so reviews isnt actually percent legit
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),stop spreading misinformation bro its underclocked
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),underclocked nope dude wrong have to say that this phone has some serious power so you ca more it is still underclocked
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yea but the chip is severely underclocked underclocked nope dude wrong have to say that this phone has some serious power so you can run everything without single problem do have the pro max the oled screen the monster battery but this iphone se is rocket in the pocket
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wrong not wrong
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),gsmarena can try again for the battery test think you wrong because have exchanged my no more yea but the chip is severely underclocked
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),touch id more convenient in darkness touch id more convenient for apple pay touch id more
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),while waiting on my iphone mini to arrive from amazon im currently using my backup iphone which on the surface is the same as the se and its real pleasure to use its simply designed and fits easily into my pockets and my notsobig hands when placed next to an iphone equipped with and amoled display you certainly notice difference in colors and slight difference in resolution otherwise out of sight out of mind the colors and resolution on the lcd is just fine performance on my is still good for typical smartphone activities with its specs so the updated ses specs is nobrainer because im photographer and an aspiring videographer im spending the extra money on the mini for the ultrawide lens night mode and cinematic mode other than that id definitely be getting the se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),se lost its beautiful shape it was so beauty
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),will se be the last iphone of its kind touch id home button notchless lcd more hope the next se either stays the same form factor or changes to the rumored notched inch with faceid but keeps the rounded edges
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its like an oldtimer with new tech inside some will say that it is boring say that this more got my iphone se in like new condition last night no flaws and for only on offerup im getting the same chip as the series and nonpro if you can deal with the outdated design getting an se for under is the best deal you can find today personally hate face id as use my phone lot in the dark and the notch can get in the way when watching movies or tv shows im not big iphone fan only got the se because nearly threw away my razr by accident it slipped into garbage bag and had to retrieve it after throwing it away in bin luckily the bin was clean ill keep my razr at home for year since it isnt fully paid off se will be my main phone for year this will be the last to offer home button and perhaps touch id the se will look more like the xr had mini and just hated face id and games like forgotton anne dont play properly on phones with face id the swipe up gesture can ruin the experience as that also is the same gesture for volume or brightness for netflix its weird that my iphone se has become my most powerful phone own when im only using it temporarily as main phone for year
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this phone might be cheaper now but xiaomi redmi note of almost the same price is striking more the xiaomi is as big as the other of smartphones roughly inch the iphone se is smaller so id choose the iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),they have the same internals if anything the se should feel faster due to having less more wow lucky fr
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),have nokia mid size smartphone do like mini smartphones although would have brough more me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),take the mini better battery and screen is bigger and read somewere that the se mo more they have the same internals if anything the se should feel faster due to having less pixels to push have had the mini and now the se the se is better deal the notch started to annoy me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),everyone says this but then buys bigger phone because they reason they will keep handset for more have nokia mid size smartphone do like mini smartphones although would have brought ktouch is mini smartphone if it was not sold out instead of the nokia keep my smartphone for years
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),really tempted to buy se but the only things holding me back are abysmal battery and high eu price heck could deal with the tiny battery if it were cheaper or more
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hi seowners does this device have poor reception like the mini and what about calling quality can you hear your partner loud and clear and vice versa
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yes funny they bring the old phones back in new jacket maby the old iphone comes next they wont go back but wish they would because of headphone jack was perfection
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its very hard too find tiny smartphone but find some opinions there is jelly more everyone says this but then buys bigger phone because they reason they will keep handset for many years your choice is limited to iphone mini or fold
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),recently traded my first se for this and im happy when you finally own bedroom more life is so simple but got so complicated am glad to hear you feel the way you do about your family from an old time guy
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),update upon intensive testing this phone has severe issues with connecting to tmob more have you tried your in los angeles california if there it is slow too may agree with you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its awesome phone and why does apple supply the charging cable without the wall plug and no ear phones its not like apple isnt wealthy company
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),how to listen to music apple iphone se open your preferred music app press play
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),does se series means small or its too small definitely not too small
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),would if was still using ios yeah may not have physical button on my android anymore more if you are so desperate for dollar phone just for button then buy it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),true are ppl buying for home button only odd would if was still using ios yeah may not have physical button on my android anymore can still use virtual buttons though ios only has swipe gestures as far as know also like the boxy display panel and how its not curved at all if had to choose would like metal back while the physical home button doesnt truly press inward the haptics feel very nice and you can even set presets although only cant do that with my current android phone actually have grown to like the haptic button more because for me it never feels different over age my old iphones home buttons feel little bit sticky havent tried to clean them yet but plan to
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lol tried it yuk couldnt even type needed magnify glass and old design depressing this more bad eyes
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),for current price of iphone se one could get iphone in the upcoming flipkartamazon sale
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),may not be far off watch this video from daved at httpsyoutubegwtalnmixi ip more must apologize for my previous comment have come to review lately and the results are just like what you describe within the review the se literally achieved an average of fps under degree celcius minutes test highest graphic settings even the redmi with dimensity can only reach fps
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and yet phone has awful battery life no matter how efficient the chip is we arent at more it sounds like youre trying to find problem with carpenters hammer because it isnt sledgehammer this is not meant as hardcore gamers phone this is not meant for someone who watches youtube hours straight this is tool for someone that wants or needs smartphone that will get them through work day have ten hour work day and rarely end that day using more than of my battery this is phone for someone who makes use of most of the functions of higher end flagship for half the price it is not meant for everyone which is perfectly fine because there are several other apple devices designed with that purpose in mind there are also dozens more from other manufacturers that fit your needs we all need carpenters to build things as much as we need we need the demo guys the tear stuff down
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),youre exaggerating arent you have never seen any reviewers obtain such results more theres not the strong chipset at value for money price paired with low resolution makes the iphone se good choice for budget gamers well thats unless you play fortune the samsung ultra not the best android at gaming or value for money and performance is not the best android has too ofter iphone se gets better fps in genshen impact ultra the asu rog pro with gb ram snapdragon gen is what we need too compare too the iphone se dont know what phone would win adding fans too the back then both would be interesting and serious gamer probably do this for keeping temperatures under control and best performance would like too see the comparison between them in genshen impact but also add few other games also gamers often play more then just one game league of legends wild rift mobile legends polywar call of duty and even fortune difference games may favour different phones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),genshin impact giant bricks like the samsung ultra is fps lesser while consuming more youre exaggerating arent you have never seen any reviewers obtain such results if its budget android phone definitely possible but flagship or upper midranger hardly believe it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),which is not the case for all inch waterdrop notched uniform bricks genshin impact giant bricks like the samsung ultra is fps lesser while consuming times more wattage
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),but it can run all latest apps smoothly which is not the case for all inch waterdrop notched uniform bricks
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this design is too old but it can run all latest apps smoothly
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),phone is great but the battery and small screen are total deal breaker true are ppl buying for home button only odd
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),not for me try new one lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),there is market for every product dont buy if doesnt cover you needs agree theres definitely market for everything only buy phones generally like and would never settle with phone dont like just really sucks small android phone choose is so poor and tech reviewers dont understand us at all and talk crap and manufacturers dont make mini versions of there line up of phones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),asus zenfones are massive there nearly the size of tablet its really frustrat more there is market for every product dont buy if doesnt cover you needs
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),probably the closest you could get are the asus zenfones know the recent ones are qui more asus zenfones are massive there nearly the size of tablet its really frustrating very few new smartphone choose from anymore at small size dont understand why wanting small smartphone not popular anyone like years ago every phone was inch that was normal size inch was considered huge and is not portable enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),has any small smartphones been made that run android dont know of any the size of the more probably the closest you could get are the asus zenfones know the recent ones are quite small compared to others
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),httpsmgsmarenacomresultsphpnyearminfdisplayinchesminfdisplayinchesma more thanks
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),some android phone companies made one but they are underpowered has any small smartphones been made that run android dont know of any the size of the iphone se dont know of any new android mini phones being made that are modern none are being made what know of if you can name any it be really helpful only buy mini smartphones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),human must stop buying apple products so they improve their products like bringing back the he more dont think these are big enough reasons for people to stop buying iphones even though id like the headphone jack back but can also imagine them bringing it on the pro with high impedance sometime in the future even though rumors point to portless iphone but rumors pointed at lot of weird stuff in the past
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),improve display and battery plz
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lets be honest for second this iphone se still blows most android midranges its very sm more its flagship now
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the asus zenfone and soon to be zenfone fit the flagship android with small more zen is slightly bigger then standard iphone size mini and se are smaller
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),diss apple all you want but at least they still make reasonably sized phones all android phon more the asus zenfone and soon to be zenfone fit the flagship android with small screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),after buying this phone at your nearest retail store please visit my gotohan located at san juan batangas near laiya first fifty costumers will get an apple iphone se screen protector
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),didnt say the iphone se has same processor as the more expensive iphone the ip more diss apple all you want but at least they still make reasonably sized phones all android phone makers these days are making ridiculously large phones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you talking shit guess youre not to enlightened about the se like you have constant elect more didnt say the iphone se has same processor as the more expensive iphone the iphone se the only iphone anyone should even consider buying just dislike apple handly cap the battery size ram amount screen hz other very apple problems with specs and cooling the more expensive others iphone are just scam no processor improvement same ios os that its made for dummies apple iphone only made for social media taking pictures texting making phone calls watching videos on youtube made for basic people apple locked the iphone down so much anyone intelligent will grow dislike for ios and the restrictive nature of it and be unable do what they want on it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),poco because miui bad at least not as bad as funtouchos
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),which one do mean this or the poco poco because miui bad
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),not in good way lmao its only decent with custom rom which one do mean this or the poco
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),of course it is cheap its cheap in good way not in good way lmao its only decent with custom rom
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),need to go to usa to buy iphone and save dollars even buy another one also missed apple classic like iphone with plastic design and cheap price want to buy iphone se plus lol if it exist with same se specs and bigger battery mah under
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why would anybody discuss with troll like you in serious fashion its ok to be serious and its ok to be unserious ok
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),agree poco loco cheep lol of course it is cheap its cheap in good way
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you madlmao if you have nothing good to reply to me then just go away
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you madlmao agree poco loco cheep lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),buy poco instead of this overpriced garbage you madlmao
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),all of the more expensive iphones are pure scam the only iphone people should ever buy is more you talking shit guess youre not to enlightened about the se like you have constant electricity so why would ya care bout the battery get it straight the phone is cool the only thing you can go against is what you are using the iphone for as for me my work is great on it dont sweat it homie the phone is made well the most amazing part is it has the same processor just like the pm so whats more
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),resolution at that size would mean the text and icons have to be upscaled at least twice more the iphone se is the least bad of the iphones and only iphone worth even worth considering as at last its not too over priced personally think anything over res on smartphone screen is overkill personally or screen would be my choice given the screen size but lose people when it is said and the its rubbish because the screen resolution is too low happen but mainstream people look at specs and think more is better so would be seen as best hz people do also want hz screen would be fine yeah the mah battery would make the phone thinker but it be worth it also just run the phone at at hz most of the time only use for watching videos and hz for gaming make good choices between performance screen quality and battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),still dont see use of more than ppi the ppi on oled iphones is just because of the more all of the more expensive iphones are pure scam the only iphone people should ever buy is the iphone se the iphone se has the same processor as the iphone pro max but is priced very badly and there no way for this price tag gb ram is unacceptable paying more for iphone then iphone se is just burning money wish it wasnt me who has too say this but tech reviewers wont tell people too never over pay for iphone or even mention the iphone is one of the worsed phone you can buy it very locked down limited and console like its missing many basic controls over the hardware and software its not the full smartphone experience and probably shouldnt even be legal too not allowed alternative app stores and side loading
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),agree apple holds there phones back from being as good as they could be think ol more resolution at that size would mean the text and icons have to be upscaled at least twice as large yeah so you will need big battery to drive that higher refresh rate then you end up with brick of phone that is no better than the current one here plus have you tried to charge mah tablet using slow charger the experience is not great right but not to say it cannot be done just saying at this form factor the specs is good for it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its such shame that this device is held back by its years old technology the form fac more agree apple holds there phones back from being as good as they could be think oled hz screen would blow android out the water if gb ram with also battery are very cheap part little know fact so there no reason not too make the phone little thicker and put mah battery inside the battery life would be though the roof if apple did this running hz on power saver apple unfortunately dont try too make the best phone they can instead hold back features make people get wait for normal luxurys so you buy there next years phone dont like this selling strategy regardless of what apple do there phones sell well it be better for everone and apple sales if apple try real hard too crash android phone makers in ever possible way in specs and performance want all out flagship killer budget brand
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),might be little wrong bout this phone it isnt for me of course battery tho
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple need to make iphone budget or whatever called with inch screen and mah battery bi more you dont seem to understand how apple worksthe phone doesnt need such large battery no iphone has mah batterybut still the lineup has great battery lifewith small mah coming from the android batteryit keeps that old design for lot of people that like the classic iphone design and prefer touch id instead of face id the chip is the best in the worldit outperforms samsung galaxy ultra and theres good improvement with battery lifeplus the as efficiency makes this phone long lastingwith an update cycle longer than any android out therethe improvement in durability is also importanteveryone chooses for themselvesandroid does offer lot of value in terms of features and customisationit offers lot of choice thats why its important but apple has lot to offer too
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),outstanding phone with form factor bazel free please single big lense camera low priority
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cant wait for this form factor to get the apple with gb ram gb storage opt more think gb ram should be bare minimum ram is cheap now but apple like dont need it think if apple make inch lets say iphone se chip nvme minimum storage option or just had sd card slot gb ram hz oled scrren as cheapest iphone se ever made it be one hell of flagship killer plus add wileless changer too the box
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the thousand dollar iphone pro called it wants its bionic chip back
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),stay to apple because of their small size phones otherwise android have better options and is more optimized for bigger screen multitasking customization have try mini but dont like their boxed shape and inconvenient faceid so far so good is perfect phone and battery keep about more than my old iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),all around good mid range that is very lightweight good for the pocket but does not have power brick because environmental reason despite them having the budget to research far more environmental friendly brick
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),chip and gb ram in midrange phone like apple now
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the best mid range phone out
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yes defeats even android flagship chips both in raw performance and battery life more that is insane how the iphone se has better gaming performance then flagship gaming smartphone just add fan and power bank mental iphone wins yeah true gb is tiny the iphone is so unbalanced ram is really cheap now but apple like dont care cant have it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),am interested in knowing iphone se with maybe using fan on it vs the lenovo legion more yes defeats even android flagship chips both in raw performance and battery life flagship android have to pack more battery to keep up thus claiming more battery life however if you leave your home with similar sized power bank this iphone will last longer than any flagship androids and still charges even with small power like car flagship android will also tend to have more ram while is not known to have lot of ram ram is fast and have high bandwidth thus it shows in benchmarks on the performance it is designed to do the task fast and then rest so it save battery life this iphone is great to play mobile games most will run at full fps no lag which is the display refresh rate as current still not able to play hz genshin impact very smoothly even need to lower resolution to keep hz if you have altstore or mac this iphone is great for emulation games what this iphone lacks vs android phone is special game modes split screens but what to split screen when the size is inches
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wouldnt say any android when thermally throttled there are some high end android devices more am interested in knowing iphone se with maybe using fan on it vs the lenovo legion gb gb ssd with builtin fans how good is this smartphones performance vs the most expensive android flagship know cheap android is no match for it the question have is does the highest spec android stand chance in gaming when phone has third party cooling
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),all iphones se have cellular issues no issues with wifi period me and my friend bo more it doesnt necessarily have to be hardware flaw it might be software bug considering theyre using new qualcomm modem personally havent experienced any speed issues with verizon mvnos here near the silicon valley
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so been looking at getting new phone for past week and since dont use my phone that much more yeah like the other person says unless youre desperate for smaller device with an even smaller screen because of the bezels absolutely need sub or are nostalgic for touch id personally wouldnt pick one up the iphone should still be very competent smartphone youll miss out on night mode with the camera
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),for gaming is this smartphone performance better than any android would this make good more wouldnt say any android when thermally throttled there are some high end android devices with better cooling that can maintain better performance but at around the price range at least in the us the raw performance is just about unmatched also no it does not burn your hands like people say theyre just very heavily exaggerating
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),im using this phone powerful chipset too powerful for small smartphone even can play pugb genshin impact without lagging everything is smooth clear mp camera the weakness is poor battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if youre happy with slightly less battery worse and smaller screen then this is great ha more btw why are you replying to your own comment with two different user names we can see you are the same person by looking at your location tag
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),brought this phone omg its way better than my se so tired of google message mess up lols
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),old design overprize low bath capacity said no thank
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),much better if apple make inch budget phone instead of who use in this generation me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),online video playback time for this phone is exactly hrmin before battery runs out and no more isnt that ok hr sot
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),maybe if you saw the rest of smartphones coming out these days you would say inches is comp more seen them in shops all ipad size what is this new normal best
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dude inches is not compact maybe if you saw the rest of smartphones coming out these days you would say inches is compact because you dont see them anymore
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont even like mrwhosetheboss though all see on his yt shorts are like smashing and tortu more true true but think phone screen sizes has plateaued reached the top of the curve few years ago phones made drastic increases from to inches now most phones are at inches the only question now is can we get used to inches phone in our hand
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),inches isnt compact since most flagship device are in to inches inches is now considered compact you can opt for smaller ones but if you want an android phone that is small than inches asus zenfone can be closer option
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),inches is now considered compact above isnt inches isnt compact
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),great phone overrallbut the battery might be its biggest problemabout hours depending more xr maybe
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),is still the best size even today wish the se was that without them damn chins
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),says who used love it is still the best size even today
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),google made an excellent compact phone for small phone people the pixel which also had gre more pixels are buggy
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wow you have so many correct factual logically thought out arguments just please be bit nice was speaking my experience on android they look boring for sure all get is midrange phone while flagships was priced like to now cheap flagship phones are now out of stock so cant buy offline online shopping cant be trusted though since they might send the wrong items instead of the correct one
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),moving ios to android is disaster dont wanna frame drops on launcher even do nothing wow you have so many correct factual logically thought out arguments just please be bit nice
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the isnt there so that you can play fortnite and pubg on the bus the is on the more its basically for people who want to buy cheap phone and keep it and not have to care about buying another one for the next years typical consumer behaviour
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),tbh in apples defanse barely any dollar phone nowadays comes with jack also more well its as cheap you can get for not garbage phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),is too large not everyone has hulk hands more like almost every phone in the industry is too large its inches and almost every phone is around that size
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the pro max was pushing much higher resolution on much larger screen feeding more ram more and yet phone has awful battery life no matter how efficient the chip is we arent at point where mh batter is big enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if the battery starts wearing down youll change it officially apple stores will change more if the phone has no warrantyexpired then the repair would be so expensive
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what if the battery have bad battery health like if the max capacity is at or below it more if the battery starts wearing down youll change it officially apple stores will change your se battery for fraction of the cost of the pro max or pixel pro bigger batteries dont mean it will wear down slower lolit just means you may be able to get away with tolerating wearing down for bit longer dunno how much tho
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it time to change from ios to android moving ios to android is disaster dont wanna frame drops on launcher even do nothing
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),have you own this phone when you said camera sucks even your mp gimmick looks more agreed my mother had this phone nd gen and it was better than my bros samsung
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont tell me what to do snob did anyone even asked you to reply like this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no headphone jack on budget phone wtf even flagship phones nowadays ditched the audio jack so you have to resort to wireless headphones or if you want to stay wired get usb to audio jack adapter
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery sucks camera sucks ram sucks design sucks have you own this phone when you said camera sucks even your mp gimmick looks worse than iphones mp battery life is short if you dont use them properly designwise they look like iphone just better insides dont even judge it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple have the marketing and specs for this phone all wrong nobody who buys this kind of iphon more the isnt there so that you can play fortnite and pubg on the bus the is on the se so that years from now it can run the latest version of ios without lagging moreover you need the because its fundamentally instructions per clock lot stronger and therefore needs less power to run the tasks at the same level of performance as the or snapdragon you need the cpu to be able to perform without needing much juice if youre limited to mere mah battery this is also the reason why the brightness is so low and the resolution is so low it was designed with the goal of aging well apple knows that the people who buy these phones are very likely to keep it for even years
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so you want terribly small screen youre pretty much the only weirdo who say more how is he wrong what do you mean by weirdo samsung kept under until the galaxy and once the became they launched the se right next to it sitting at apple always has sub device and thank god they still make sub too the reason androids arent launching sub isnt because they think its niche market they are not launching those because optimizing for android is lot more difficult than optimizing for ios and smaller phone will inevitably have smaller battery the snapdragon exynos and helios are much less efficient than the and android today with its powerful set of many features requires lot of juice to run the ipcs on the cpus of android phones is considerably weaker than the therefore if you made android or soon android run on snapdragon gen on mah battery you are going to have rough scandal only google and samsung could afford to develop proper android rom for their own respective proprietary chipsets to be able to get good hours of screen on time on sub mah battery but they have already spread their developer teams too thin with other hardware make no mistake the market is hard to tackle but potentially packs the greatest yield over time
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yeah highly doubt it considering thats same sot that iphone pro max was getting wit more the pro max was pushing much higher resolution on much larger screen feeding more ram and had less efficient cpu the se is essentially easy peasy for the you put the strongest and most efficient cpu on the planet inside very basic phone you shouldnt need big battery to have more than decent screenon time
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),there are lot of those kind of people on hereforcing their opinions on others like the more their opinions are like to forcing people into buying spydroid hate the kinds of people for example if want to buy an iphone then someone forced me to buy chinese android phone that has the same cam setup like main macro and useless depth sensor and stupid amount of ram
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),weeks with this phone chipset are great too powerful for small smarphone even no lagging more buy portable charger make sure it is mah in capacity
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dont settle for less get yourself an android samsung is great choice is too large not everyone has hulk hands
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),finally larger battery mah battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this iphone se is usless phonevery poor batrary and old design
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),sot yeah highly doubt it considering thats same sot that iphone pro max was getting with much much bigger battery not to mention that gsmarenas own review says they got which is much weaker then any other new phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery life sucks sot
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thats fair but it still should be at least hz at this price think hz lcd would have made this phone perfect apple would have played through smartphone making nothing could ever top it it just wouldnt be possible
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what if prefer lcd thats fair but it still should be at least hz at this price
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),please dont motivate anorexia you could be very well fed and still fit meal on the bezels the bezels on this phone are so tremendous straight out of
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),then you must be the most stupid person that ever born in this world
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple are really push releasing new se iphones smaller sleeker designs theyre released si more he probably couldnt stand you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),best portable phone in in my view blazing fast performance very good battery life of almost two days with moderate use but with background app refresh turned off cell phone is first and foremost communication and productivity tool therefore those criticising the iphone se should first of all know what they really want to do with the cell phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),with the right kind of diet you could fit your whole meal on the ses bezels please dont motivate anorexia
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),deleted post had stroke trying to read that
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and high refresh rate and even then it should be an amoled at this price what if prefer lcd
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),we crossed year display should be atleast ppi battery mah more and high refresh rate and even then it should be an amoled at this price
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),small but greats only for casual user
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),how many hours is your sot on average at the moment got home and have hmin standby and hmin sot and have battery leftse battery is more than adequaterunning ios
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the only phone where the battery endurance rating practically matches the gfxbenchmark fps number
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thank you and am not zombie tho want to ask if you need to recharge it tho if us more go to bed at night in the for percentage and im casual light user
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if your one of those phone zombies who need it shoved in their face all day this phone is not more thank you and am not zombie tho want to ask if you need to recharge it tho if use it for spotify and social apps should charge it trough the day
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),phone not matching with looks so ugly small battery small screen single camera dont even pay buying this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),did mean the iphone se this is the iphone se version you are right my bad sorry
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this iphone does not have the chip it has an did mean the iphone se this is the iphone se version
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yes it is you were talking about home button right and learn some basic reading comprehension mate discussion does not make sense if one party switches to different topic every other moment education might be free but in your case it seems like it was for nothing
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple iphone should start working on battery life on their phones the world image gone past more what do you mean they should start working on their phones battery life the pro max beats the ultra by significant amount in terms of battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),how is that an answer to what wrote yes it is you were talking about home button right
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),move on this is you guys must be nostalgists if want physical home button besides more how is that an answer to what wrote
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery life this must be joke in
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this is its as wide as inch iphone mini millimeter wider actually just not as more move on this is you guys must be nostalgists if want physical home button besides physical home button will decrease the screentobody ratio
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),mean ik some people like small phones but find that the fact that people like more this is its as wide as inch iphone mini millimeter wider actually just not as tall but the notch eats into that same for the virtual home bar stead of physical home button look here httpdisplaywarscominchxvsinchdbxd
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),me and the millions of people who buy iphones with inch inch inch and inch more mean ik some people like small phones but find that the fact that people like in is ridiculous is already enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its just too big so you want terribly small screen youre pretty much the only weirdo who says is not small enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it aint too big its only too big
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),trash phone buy samsung instead it is far more superior compared to this trash better cameras better display microsd card support etc just the processor and number of software updates are worse
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),things like this do exist in the pc world as well theyre called sleeper pcs more this exists with cars too like year old vw golfpassat tuned with horsepower
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),there are more factors to whether camera is good or bad than resolution thats what im trying to say iphone ses camera is bad unless all using the main camera only
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),really so you want mp ultrawide camera mp is already decent you say its bad there are more factors to whether camera is good or bad than resolution
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dude can feel the added mm width on su compared to my previous su let alone whole more idk just use ultra and even thats not too big by my standards see no reason to get ultra
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),isnt it only does it really matter dont get it dude can feel the added mm width on su compared to my previous su let alone whole cm in width what are you even talking about
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),main camera photos on the se are superior the ultrawide on any android that is not flagship more furthermore se has no night mode samsung has night mode on both main and ultrawide cameras
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),only cm taller and cm wider yeah sure thing only isnt it only does it really matter dont get it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what joke am cracking the cameras are actually better in terms of versatility samsung more main camera photos on the se are superior the ultrawide on any android that is not flagship is pretty bad and the front camera is something few people actually care especially if you are phone nerd browsing this website
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ugly lil monsta those luxurious bezels
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),better cameras great joke man laughed lot those triple cams real delight
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),budget phone needs budget pricing and have the phone used it for days and returning bac more well there is better for price apple lazy lol xr body nicer least ditch those huge chins
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),funny got the iphone rd gen for free from my service provider the day it was releas more budget phone needs budget pricing and have the phone used it for days and returning back to android now
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why do need night mode if have flash
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),imagine using plastic phone that gets all greasy and scratchy over the years until it just more the only thing bad for enviroment is that you are having to trow away yor month old phone after not being able to repair the screen for lower than
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no thank you apple way overpriced for the specs and battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),all the hate is unjustified this phone is an absolute banger but the price is bit too high even more so in europe than us but if thats the biggest flaw its good phone because the price can drop depreciation used market design is subjective and like it the display is not bad at all well calibrated wide color gamut the onehandfriendly size is an advantage for me and even the battery life is improved as well as the camera in the future this will become cheaper than the mini used and when get great deal ill probably upgrade to it from my se could care less about flat edge design and small bezels my phone is an internet communication device and camera not fashion accessory
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),bad design high price need say more imagine using plastic phone that gets all greasy and scratchy over the years until it just melts in your hands ugh disgusting and bad for the environment too
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the phone itself isnt too bad and upgrades from the og version but the price is so bad that would never consider buying it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),design straight from what hideous device over lmao
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),smartphone from but with modern soc
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),is useful for those who are using their phones without wifi web pages load fast and downloads are fast too in fact did two internet speed tests on my galaxy which was with wifi and without wifi the conclusion is that the test without wifi was faster than the one with wifi which meant that the on my galaxy is faster than my own wifi
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and the rest get pixel coming out wayyyy better too big
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yikes the screen to body ratio old xperia has screen to body ratio and people scream thick bezel
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the battery in this phone is real disaster and the rest get pixel coming out wayyyy better
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it depends on what youre priorities are my man the poco pro has the better chipset more thank you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),with better processor you get better battery life because the cpu finish the task faster more are you serious please dont post absolute dribble without any evidence or anything to back up your statement gsm arena the very website youre on right now and one of the best smartphone reviewers already have comparison table of battery tests from their reviews if the better chip means better battery life explain these results iphone se hours one of the lowest recorded scores this decade samsung as hours redmi note pro hours samsung hours oppo reno hours all of the above handsets are cheaper than the iphone se whats your next empty statement youd like me to debunk publicly
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you shouldnt be having hard time at all youre comparing an old handset with more thank you so much one more thing and wont be bothering you anymore poco pro or lite ne
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what about camera and performance which phone is better overall im having hard time more you shouldnt be having hard time at all youre comparing an old handset with tiny battery lcd display with hz refresh rate charging with no charger included and nonexpandable storage compared to the xiaomi lite its not even competition the xiaomi blows the se out of the water camera wise theyll both deliver similar performance but youll have far more options and generally much more capable and versatile camera on the lite if youre looking for bang for your buck you should also consider the redmi note pro as its cheaper than the lite currently on xiaomis website this morning and punches it out in some areas
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if youre looking for good battery life you definately shouldnt go for the iphone more what about camera and performance which phone is better overall im having hard time to decide which one to get
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),nice phoneit replaced my mini which brokebattery is pretty much the same as the minii more no the battery is very less if youre not using your phone youll get battery to day end but people actually use their phones and get around hrs sot
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),used this in storeit wasnt bad bad but damn you need vision why people say its good more this is not compact this is old tech phone which happens to be small compact in todays terminology is what the iphone mini models are or phones having bezelless display with width less than or equal to mm
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),now that photo tests are available it seems to me that the image is better on the previous iphone se details are better rendered specially text and the contrast is pronounced on the new se masking some colour details people who have the previous se certainly wouldnt bother upgrading to that one unless they really want the cheapest and smallest new iphone they can get to have the maximum life span on their phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),very rough mobile see ever
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),emojis are for idiots with no imagination but we all use them dd lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),android no thanks giant phone no thanks love my se fly in this machine erm samsung sure there is some big ones about but is little
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),who still uses smilies are you stuck in the emojis are for idiots with no imagination
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),how big is the difference in camera comparing mini and se do both have night mode theres no night mode on the se the cameras on the mini are better
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),calling people idiots yet you have sucky microshaft product usernamehmmmm think il more who still uses smilies are you stuck in the
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),should have use iphone design this year
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),honestlyglad they keep coming out with these my year old grandmother could never learn to use anything more advance in design than this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what an underwhelming pos still rocking the same display as found as the iphone and only more calling people idiots yet you have sucky microshaft product usernamehmmmm think ill pass on listening to you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),my major gripe is that apple said they were going to make larger version of the se back in more when did they ever say that they were going to be making plus model
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),people complain to complain only one camera yes no ultra wide or telephoto lens but it more its downgrade from every phone in the same price range in literally every aspect except the processor only thing people use as an excuse are the updates like thats gonna change anything apple was literally caught and later said that he is rolling out updates that are slowing down phones to save batterylike cmon lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hz lsd display dont buy this for your child best apple joke in
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),so far it can last whole day im impressed the battery life specially when youre heavy user
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),not even gonna lie sort of see the design as positive third party and diy repair is going to be so cheap since you can just use an screen housing and everything heck even if you can bear living without truetone and home button
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the se was always about reusing an old design with newer cpu this one even has stil more what do you need for this small battery besides is proven to cause more damage to body better off stay out of radiation as much as possible or else theyll catch you as cvid bullst
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),adding hole punch and sidemounted fingerprint sensor on the power button while also extending the screen size to inches or more would be real upgrade but that would kill the iphone lineups
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),problem is the battery is still the same size even if its new technology batter more battery will still be problem since the phone has it wont get significant better battery time
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),but hope you have big eyes lolneed it really too much time in front of screens damages your eyes all operating systems has accessibility functions to augment the screen content unless youre professional spending too much time consuming digital content is waste of time and bad for your well being
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),disagree with everything ive just bought one find the phone fast at everything do batt more disagree with all lmao most of what stated were basic specifications that this phone has
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),havent used it because its not worth testingjust generic phone which is really overpriced and cannot compete with any phone above the price segmentthe company says they have done good job but all they have done is slightly improve the model and insert the bionic chipthe battery life and lcd display is still concern for this phone and would never recommend it to anyonethis is not something that we expect from huge company like applealso this is marketing strategy that they are tryingto persuade apple fans from increasing their budget and get the new iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its that an iphobe
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),surprising all the android fanboys attack the camera as that is the only thing they can do more performance is useless when everything else sucks its poorly made just hd lcd screen no high refresh rate no protective glass weak battery no fast charging no sd card slot no mm jack and on top of that its overpriced literally need to pay for gb version and in europe is if yiu you are lucky
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well have to disagree look at realme gt neo same price or even cheaper only cm tal more only cm taller and cm wider yeah sure thing only
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),amen find it perfect smartphone introduction to seniors who want small and bugfree more well have to disagree look at realme gt neo same price or even cheaper only cm taller and cm wider but vs inch lcd vs amoled both bug free and realme for sure comes with better battery life and fastest charging with small degradation battery even smaller than iphone itself bigger screen make elders easier to read
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),still waiting for battery review
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),new camera setup big battery faster touch id and also supports the reason it costs more more what new camera setup lmao its completely same just with filters now available or better to say iphone photographic styles which as apple is saying require the best phone processor to be available and it still doesnt support night mode lol truly disappointing
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dear fanboys really getting tired of the typical who buys this piece of garbage when more amen find it perfect smartphone introduction to seniors who want small and bugfree experience on budget unfortunately android skipped on that one for years now especially the small part for my dad for instance this would be perfect replacement for his archaic nokia still small and light but with much larger touchscreen home and mute button for simplicity blazing fast ui solid battery performer for someone who only talks and texts hell even if it drops bars its still huge upgrade since he can quickly charge it in like an hour opposed to nokia which charges for hours lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),oh my god its new model but all features and styles has nothing different than the old bu more it was expected it would keep the same design but it has the new chip found on iphone models gb of ram instead of and supports speeds bigger battery camera department it has many of the features of iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),as family we own four iphones and one android the oldest iphone plus old screen th more considered the galaxy as before deciding on keeping my iphone for while more by replacing the battery looks like solid phone but going through the pain of changing platforms and looking for the right apps because not all are available on both platforms also phone is somewhat too big for my taste
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),qi ip certificate ah the wireless charging is unavailable but not dealbreaker for that price and yes both have ip ratings
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),buy samsung it has better display better camera better battery maybe better every more qi ip certificate
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),not saying that those features are necessary its just at some point they should include some things at that price
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thechessguy mar think this is the only phone at any price in to have mp front camera like cmon apple gotta be honest dont care about the front facing camera only time use it is as mirror sometimes and for the facetime calls per year do
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),despite all hates on internet se is already sold out in my country so think people buy this phone lot
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),since blackberry disappeared from the globe had no choice than to acquire this new se whe more see what you did there xd
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),who are the people who buy this joke of phone at euro and why so expensive with more purchased one yesterday it really gives retro look like it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),in se spec correct please the capacity of battery to wh it is nearly wh more than more thats literally mah stated in the website already as apple hides their battery capacities at launch
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),little not worth but atleast the processor is much better you can go for iphone mini or iphone than this its your decision
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why people recommend grandparents they need magnify glass cmon should be at least ok giant
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the phone you want is already made they call it iphone the point of the iphone se is to have an option for either older fellow or to be used like an ipod yes it has the performance of but at cheaper price option
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the iphone se is really the best smartphone for one handed users love the and the such powerful house in little tiny body love you apple fan forever
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),honestly expected an iphone xr design not this again the phone may be faster than its pre more the phone you want is already made they call it iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you should just buy used iphone like dont buy an iphone instead
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cmon why do people have to live with apples damn crazy years updates at least ye more then ya stuck if apple release crap ios and designs change heck im bored after yrs hahahahah this big bezel make me feel like not updated in decade hahahahah friends be like you using ip
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),people with tiny hands like me thank lot these compact phones most smartphones today are more but hope you have big eyes lolneed it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),your selfies look like nokia lol front cam
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),but why so big body to screen ratio look so oldi this iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),me and swapped my crappy samsung fe for it why did you do it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),even euros for the se is expensive its almost of my month salary and usually more in the end it would have to be the case still holding on my iphone with replaced battery lets say it lasts another two years then get this iphone se which would be two years old with four years of software updates ahead then what
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),true feel ridiculous holding those thin slabs and cant handle them properly with one more even euros for the se is expensive its almost of my month salary and usually dont spend more than euros for phone but today all companies are raising prices so probably my next phone will be some phablet
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why dont they issue us economic iphones with removable battery minute ram rom more you should just buy used iphone like
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),that would be good upgrade since it will allow go full hd while having similar body more that would make it as bigbigger than the battery might get bigger but so does the size hearing that the se is gonna merge with the mini mini being the least sold is special edition on its own anyway
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),mah in se spec correct please the capacity of battery to wh it is nearly wh more than se though with also slightly jigher voltage vs
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),price about eur no its eur everywhere in europe eur for the gb model its not cheap or budget friendly purchase
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),is apple really thinking we are fools this hands down was the biggest disappointment they more apple has enough options for you mini mini if you like zenfone size then the standard and are even ok same for pro xs you all moan about this phone and dont realize that it is not made for you apple has enough variety for everyone the only thing you want is the price point of this phone listen you cant have everything you wont get your dream phone for free got it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone se is really great device but the screen should atleast be extended to just buy mini if you want that this phone if for people who want home button
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone is way better than android thats what we call an opinion round here
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),because at quick glance there is not gonna be much distinguishing it from their lineup more that would be good upgrade since it will allow go full hd while having similar body size of the xr is manageable increase dramatically the battery it can go over mah give more cameras
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this phones battery capacity is mah yall actually is mah is more considering that gives hours in in definately will be more
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone is miles worse accept it or not it is the truth lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its really outdated is useless if you only have screen looks like they had many lef more actually you can also get second hand mini which is mileeeeees ahead
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),went with an used iphn instead of this better camera better display more features and ofc better battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),maximus mar if you dont like itdont buy itas simple as thatthere are many people out ther more thats absolutely right
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),brilliant phone for the price lot faster than any android phone the same price this phone more oh you should have echoed it out and let us know on time that this apple package is far superior to any android out there but now that you are saying it so latelyi think is too tempting to let go of my android with full level of customizationenough battery to power my gaming and gallery all day long shti need your help as fvk
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),instead of buying this you can get used iphone in really good condition with brand new replaced battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),get the or over this phone they have much better specs than this trash phone just more those monsters
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ahh shere we go again
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),specification is not the only thing to buy phone getting into apple ecosystem this value more cmon why do people have to live with apples damn crazy years updates at least years is enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this is near garbage dont know why apple does that except bolding this only option just buy high range iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),increase not bad if true thats video not day on phone be much like se apple being coy lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),someone had torn down the phone and revealed the battery capacity as mah
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),damni would never buy this for yeah is perfect size
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hr sot you tube owch for better options out there to small
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),open genshin impact and then play the game for hr and few minutes lol no thanks haha have tried playing genshin impact with iphone and get like hour minutes from to with battery life yes brought secondhand and the battery life is about when get it guess battery life might be slightly improved with the new apple bionic chipset on the new iphone se rd gen or iphone se bet it can last around as good as hours of extreme heavy graphics intensive gaming compared to iphone really hope that iphone se rd gen give at least mah battery mah more than previous models know it cannot fit very large batteries due to small phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the battery of this phone remains mystery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this phone can run genshin impact at fps locked better than most flagship android offerings more for hour and few minutes
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),they had iphone plus with good screen wish screen was bigger
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),who would spend for phone that has lower production costs you can buy samsung more and extremely big size that is not practically operatable unless you exclusively use it with two hands which is mit always possible in real life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),damn you must have really tiny hands even the pro is extremely comfortable to us more damn you must have massive hands
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),main and realistically only letdown of this phone is screen inch lcd with more why is inch greed when size is preference
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),had been using inch se for years happy about it it looks like this new se is not wort more damn you must have really tiny hands even the pro is extremely comfortable to use for me at least with with one hand
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),very true what you said am glad they came up with small size personally prefer small ph more who would spend for phone that has lower production costs you can buy samsung for that money with extremely better screen extremely better camera setup and battery that is about times larger
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and its not rebranded because it actually has better technology selling redmi as poco is more yeap but he thinks its rebranded its an iphone body with better hardware
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),something wrong about the battery thats why apple hid the battery specs for now may more tests already said end of day thats fine gawd what you want for price yrs for that is good android getting sick of their bipolar updates home button is sooooo handy im buying it regardless of all the battery talk not just on se but samsung too
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),still doesnt have night mode lmao you have it on other iphone models or other phone models abundance of choice for the night photographer in you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),valueformoney is guess apple level
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone actually and its not rebranded because it actually has better technology selling redmi as poco is rebranding
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),are you sure they said it lasts hrs longer than the iphone se that should make it on par with the iphone endurance which is to say just enough for mild daily usage
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),generally speaking the iphone se crowd consists of folks who arent phone addicts they dont more very true what you said am glad they came up with small size personally prefer small phones as it is convenient and has the feature that normal phone has highly recommend for student and senior to keep up with technology with convenience to carry
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its like putting engine in camry
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),because it is design lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),make it as small as you can then get the glasses for it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no battery size info apple mentioned making the battery bigger and more optimized would love to see how much of an improvement there will be in the battery section
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),screen at least
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),also you can get so many android phones that are so much better for the same price these incl more hey stinky do you care about privacy
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the design is just disappointing
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),mah that too less battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),some people on macrumors found out in apples public legal documents which assumed to be more increase not bad if true
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),with that topbottom bezel can fit like ten jackbut none
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone with new processor this is the iphone we never saw
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cheap iphone with enabled lot more process power than most phones the same price would say its bargain for the price and also will be software updated for the next years how many other phone the same price can say that
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),like every year same phone just changing the processor it is not what expected
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),fans of this form factor will love this phone its nice to have something thin and light more like your comment
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),old ugly design with thick bezels and low quality screen except that everything else is in favour of this phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),these are honda civics with super engines had an audi bmw ferrari this will be my more updated notes apologies noticed the wrong draft posted first time user corrections iphone se comes with gb ram not gb iphone se price is for gb not iphone se is only network speed but still punches tech spec wise
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ugly old design slow charge large bezel small battery poor camera system hz sub hd screen its like having porsche engine in cardboard chassis iphone mini is much better phone if you like small phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if what youre looking for is an iphone with small form factor id pick the mini more agree larger screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),before more of you guys spitting dumb statements all over here the reason the battery size isnt stated here is because it is not yet released to the public no information on that regard is released yet not because there is hidden agenda or they expected us to discover ourselve after purchase god please stop making speculations
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and they telling us chip and ram will give hrs more hahahahahhaha
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dude if you look closer youll realize that you find no mah values whatsoever the only more then its most likely same
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),funny how it doesnt state the size of the battery on the purchase page dude if you look closer youll realize that you find no mah values whatsoever the only way for us to find the battery percentage is to open the phone to inspect the battery itself
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),couldnt care less if it squeezes hours of screen online thats all need more want iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),smartsaad im not gamer but why bother when you can get phones with better camera more ram and larger battery why downgrade when you have better options thats my point exactly there are so many options for everyone why shouldnt there be an option for people who like this type of phone why does it bother some people that there are more options they dont agree with never complained about the big screen big battery phones only complained there were no small good phones now there is one and people go mad about it why in the last at least years if you googled best inch phone there were viable options and even those were soso not comparable with the flagships but the market was flooded with over inch displays gram phones with huge brick batteries why why not more options you also say people look for everything in their midrange phone because they cant splurge on an expensive pc like that phones are used for more purposes like it too that people have more options but this is exactly what im trying to say and why you dont get my point this phone is just another option very different from the herd of the phones have no bezels over screenbody ratio between and mah batteries they all look as if thats the only allowed thing to do when you manufacture phone and then there comes this lil thing almost like teleported from but is capable to do what the new top of the line phones can do and ppl lose their mind why because its not like the rest so diversity is so hated nowadays that everything thats not in line with the sheeple must disappear hmm anonymous said if what youre looking for is an iphone with small form factor id pick the mini over this to be quite honest with you thank you but hate faceid as much as love touchid also this se costs almost half of mini can live without oled dual camera and more hours of screen online ive been waiting for phone exactly like this for at least years and seeing the hate it receives makes me even happier in world full of bigger and bigger phones apple had the balls to make decision like this kudos thats pimp move fo sho as said haters gon hate keep it up we live in unanimity dictatorship anyway you cant say anything outside the box cant have something unusual cant like or express yourself in different way cant be or act how you feel this hate for diversity went so far that it made ppl complain for product thats just not how they like it to be jeezzzz gotta love
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no dont want tablet want phone tablets are phones are still very distinct
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),for euros no thank you this phone is max euros
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple shouldve been change the design at least make it in iphone xr shell
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),love it bought it at am pst piss about it all you want it will stand on its own for hours before it dies lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),one sentencewhat the is wrong with apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),gsmarena tell the battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),not complaining but dont want to be fooled either another scenario be transparent where more couldnt care less if it squeezes hours of screen online thats all need you know why dont understand the complains because this phone isnt supposed to be hours screen online gaming phone due to low battery and small screen so then why are ppl complaining as if all the phones that launch nowadays must be used as minitablet cant phone be used as daily routine all around social mediacommunication device there are phones for gamers and ppl who want inch display and mah battery and if theres finally one phone with inch display and battery that offers hours of screen online all the gamers are crying cyber lullaby wait for phone like this for about years good all around phone with display under or around inch super fast with touchid that can get at least years of updates and now when it freakin finally launches all the whiners pick on things as if they dont have tens and hundreds of other options usually say to each his own but because since the launch the entire youtube and all the forums are full of crybabies really am glad this se is thorn in their side haters gon hate
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),because some people really really like touch id because in display fingerprint sensor is reserved for some version of iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),see the new chip as downgrade since it has combined with battery almost similar to ps controller dont see how is this phone better than se and why it is called an upgrade in the first place
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),agree is it another charge day why hide battery ram and chip wont make it las more facts
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphoney fans rocket in pocket
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),fkin hate all phones with more than inch display but never complain when ne more not complaining but dont want to be fooled either another scenario be transparent where is battery number
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),on apple has done good job for this se but this fingerprint thing must now go why cou more because some people really really like touch id
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it is meant for those who are looking for an affordable iphone but then apple never wanted to compromise on basic user experience of ios even for an affordable offering hence latest soc and latest of os in an old design it is good soc and an efficient os that are absolutely must for great user experience even the best of hardware elements like screen and battery are of no use if soc and os are inefficient yes what latest se lacks is refined physical design elements but then smart user knows how to make the best use of the design honesty dont see any great advantage of having bezel less design except that it gives bigger screen area while keeping smaller physical footprint of the device there are better offerings at the price from the android world but then it is upto user to make choice this choice can be about os and soc or something more like bigger screen beefier battery number of camera modules and so on
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well dont care what people say about this ive had succession of iphones from the original onwards and when the first se came out was hooked this is my sweet spot form factor that suits my fingers touch id just dont get why people want to wave their phone at their face sometimes want to unlock mine while its still sitting on my desk more than decent camera dabbled with an iphone for while cant even remember why think needed storage bump and my carrier had them on offer but now the se is out im biting their hand off to get one
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this for is complete joke
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),excellent cameras and screen meh what will someone do with all those high sp more the iphone se and have the same screen basically just that the se is smaller which some people prefer but those who want the iphone should just buy the iphone by the way it is not screen because it has higher brightness vs nits wide color gamut vs srgb outstanding calibration out of the factory
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yea but this phone is more powerfull than all of those devices listed only if it had bette more the iphone is still more powerful than those and has bigger screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wasnt expecting this we need to keep this design exactly happy to see manufacturer making phones at last but with the trade off of having no versatility whatsoever
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),in times of masks the touchid still makes sense why apple isnt offering both possibili more problem is the battery is still the same size even if its new technology battery wrong apple told the verge that the battery has higher capacity the form factor isnt all that bad they could have just upped the factor to the mini form that would eat into iphone mini mini sales
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),technically we dont know the capacity of the iphone se yet as apple has kept th more they wont cause it would cut into the profits of iphone mini and
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why the stone age design any ideas
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),waiting for detail review
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple should use iphone xr desain rather than old ratio
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),love iphone but this is very precious and old fashioned design
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),sounds like an extremly unbalanced phone and an bionic paired with inch screen more excellent cameras and screen meh what will someone do with all those high specs on this underwhelming screen they should have given an iphone display atleast and put in the instead of and it will sell more than any other phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its an iphone re recycled edition lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),sure mahn that inches stands out and makes me worried that inches is the best thing on this phone we already have tons of bricks with os unfortunately the size is the only good thing about this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),problem todays apps will be small facebook squint and emails need eyesite
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),do get set of steak knives with it more get
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cmon applestop geekbench thing and make out something appeasing to burn those huge cash on my little experience with ios made me vow never to make an iphone main phone but an assisting device be it the pro max or pro ultramax if at least you have spend much timeyrs on both driods and iossure you will understand better while iphones are much powerful with processing driods are much full of experiences beginning from charging speedschinese to stylus powersamsung of which non are found with ios experience but to end bragging all about get both and it will shock you ios are not daily main drivers devices despite processing power on paper
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),seems that apple cant let the iphone be matter of the past
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),next se will be rebranded iphone nostalgia
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),with this powerful hardware naaahhh maybe if its an all screen display and not this more sure mahn that inches stands out and makes me worried
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),same design as iphone from years ago less than mah battery
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wow bad phone indeed but its gonna sell like hot cakes especially with companies my company issues se to hundreds of employees guess what well be upgrading to
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),around dollars for phone with inch hz lps screen with year old design and awful camera the only reason why this could be better than the iphone se is the chip which is too much for the battery no info about battery but since its same dimensions it wont be that different from se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its actually not that bad good soc compact no notch or hole whatsoever not th more its refreshing the body screen and cameras for rd time for is awful its robbery actually get nd hand devices with fhd qhd hzhz screens and periscopetelephoto cameras with far superior main cam quality for the same price and same everyday performance chips from years ago will perform equal in standard daily phone usage im sure you could even get an iphone for cheaper better phone except cpu which wont affect every day use so yes it really really is bad
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),to get people to buy the iphone they dont want you to buy cheap more yeah ive heard that argument still as product as device this phone should be criticized understand its part of bigger plan they have but looking at the device in technical way its letdown for the price its bad deal considering the specs now if you value lot getting into the ios system at lower price its understandable think but id rather buy an iphone that costs more but its better phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no nightmode
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),that and the google pixel would be my devices of choice in android land but still big phon more the as gets software updates and years of security updates
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and its too big handlet detected
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),bad phone of the year inches displaylol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its crazy how if you put se and from side by side they look exactly the same from more at the eu were paying for the american dream its too expensive
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),over for lcd display and bezels ive just bought an as brand new for more that and the google pixel would be my devices of choice in android land but still big phones for me the would be my preferred one but would it get more than two years of major software releases
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ok it has gb ram thats huge on ios and with screen what about the capacity of the battery why is it taking time to have the full specs of that phone and not new thing with apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),bulbulitobayagbag mar because the reasoning they have is small compact phone and the cheapest iphone mean they can put bigger battery if they use the iphone plus design im guessing the battery under mah and the battery consume must be drain fast
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if se is similar except and chipset then will say to buy this is wastage of money stay on se or minis chipset is still flagship sometimes apple tries to rob its fans unfortunately
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),another rebranded iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this can never give me the feeling of nostalgia
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),who in the world thought about this atrocity cant even fathom the idea of this in not even if it was supposed to be authentic mean the price of high end midrange android just for this bruh
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),only chipset update
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),totally not acceptable for phone its what it costs in my country in europe more to get people to buy the iphone they dont want you to buy cheap iphone they want you to buy the most expensive they released this phone just to get people into the apple eco system they know the phones features are dated except the but everything else belongs in so they will push you to get the more premium phones before you apple bash me do have iphone knowing this would happen anyway
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),disappointed the design common apple is already is not iphone design maybe you more that is there whole idea just incase they dropped this phone to bring people into the apple ecosystem
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),seriously phone with hrz display in is absolutely useless dont know way are ppl so hyped about this small phone with hrz is of no use in those days apple keep disappointing every year with hi prises
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),correct the specification make it gb ram httpswwwgsmarenacomapplesnewiphonesereportedlyhasgboframmorethanitspredecessornewsphp
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),im so glad bought the iphone brand two weeks ago for yep it is still pricier here in the philippines was about to wait for this hoping for atleast an iphone xs body with an bionic chipset but no they still recycled the iphone body now so happy with my iphone will keep it till it no longer be supported by apple best purchase ever had coming from an android phones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),seriously apple this aint wrong its
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),every other comment on here talking about androids in the same price range would beat this yo more its carl any other phone will demolish se even some phones have better specs then se its cpu will be downgraded to abionic level and its mpx camera is underwhelming especially for phones with imx like nord or gt neo gw
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),getting mini instead of this one mini
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),stupid phone in
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),other specs can also make do why is the ram still gb totally should add to gb
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),theres no compact android phone nuff said
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),trust me there are lots of brainwashed people out there lol in the us there are not lot of competition really samsung is so the only brands that people buy in the us are apple or samsung and then you get guys like motorola and nokia fighting for scraps
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),better buying redmi note which is better than this yeah like redmi is sold in the us dont think apple is forcing people to buy this but they know it will sell eventually
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why apple dont use the iphone plus design instead the mini version its feel so more because the reasoning they have is small compact phone and the cheapest iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the old one was the new one is only dollar difference thats not double buddy hahaha had his facts wrong
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this has the same lcd display from iphone and the same mah battery and gb ram in
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),when they gonna change the display to oled lcd drains battery harder
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),who cares the phone is still bad ips lcd at this price makes no sense know know more this is the specs the demographic of this smartphone looks for ill list it below cheapest possible iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its matter of fact android at the same price is better than this really believe this se model should be discontinued if its continue to be like this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dumb and put into trash is it time for small display
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),see here androids at have quadruple cameras their quadruple cameras more compare it to androids in the same price range not androids they clean the floor with the iphone with hz refresh rate brighter higher resolution oled tempered glass backfront hdr great battery better and multiple cameras mm jack sd card slot fast charging truly disappointing good processor is unusable if everting else sucks
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),would rather buy pixel for the same price as this se beats it in every way except chipset
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),who wants to buy lcd panel for comeon apple you are pushing customer to buy us more my mom
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this specs makes me cry and laugh at same time how the to put an ips and that body size screen like the series from ancient times come on who want to buy this cr don give cents on iphone software until they put components in smartphone this is by far the best iphone with an
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),waaaaiiitt isnt this the same iphone se from but double the price apple more the old one was the new one is only dollar difference thats not double buddy
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it seems apple are taking phones people have thrown away but some new bits inside then selling those phones again gives whole new meaning to re cycling owned one apple phone before didnt like it within week went bk to android and android will stay
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no oled screen even for what joke very bad indeed
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hey its pixel per inch ppi this has nothing to do with the size of the screen more who cares the phone is still bad ips lcd at this price makes no sense know know its an iphone doesnt change the fact its bad phone thats absurdly priced
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),it has chip wow
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),wow is sooo powerful apple even know that the market which this phone is destined to will not see the difference between iphone and this one with case on it those people dont run behind or for them better battery would have been nice
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),ppi is good bigger phones need bigger resolution to achieve the same sharpness hey its pixel per inch ppi this has nothing to do with the size of the screen its per inch my phone has around ppi no matter how much screen you use its still sharper than retina ppi think that only reason for apple to use these low resolution screens is to be able to install smaller cheaper battery and still has decent battery life with very powerful think that battery size is the same as later se model so derfor low resolution screen many apple users do not expect more from iphone and of iphones are sold through monthly payment deals so most of them will be happy guess
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),does apple know how just larger screen would have made this fly off the shelves
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),iphone rebranding
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery is not even known yet and you already call it disappointing the whole phone is already disappointing enoughbattery life doesnt help any think
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery is so disappointing battery is not even known yet and you already call it disappointing
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),like apple too but why they have to sell this phone this phone is very unbalanced more ppi is good bigger phones need bigger resolution to achieve the same sharpness
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),leftover parts used to build this phones skip exactly
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),such design is is joke still apple fans are going to defend this galaxy as user as well as android user here would rather have plain rectangular display with no curved corners or cutouts and dedicated home buttons
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),display with corners and not notch finally display in new phone plus home button with no gesture garbage
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),fast charging but mah battery lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),there is so much negativity around this phone around here that cant understand there more how about you understand that android below this range has everything this phone is offering apart from the chipsets and updates this phone is simply recycled phone from apple that will sell only because of that logo on that back not because its amazing or due to its value might as well add the environment friendly sticker on this cause they are doing favour to the environment by recycling
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you already know thatll probably end up costing easy
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),seriously apple think this model will attract anyone something like joke trust me there are lots of brainwashed people out there lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),yeah can we get plus model you already know thatll probably end up costing
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),recycled by apple inc
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple after steve jobs left back to the stone age
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),honestly dont think this phone is bad but dont think its good either its just meh they basically copy pasted the se from and added new chip which in itself was copy paste of the with new chip yeah the iphone design is outdated now even if some people may still like it feel like it wouldve been better if apple used the xr design instead or if they just made the screen slightly taller and made the top and bottom bezels smaller removing the home button and moving the touch id to the power button yeah the inside is probably underclocked think the in the model was underclocked dunno yeah the battery life probably wont be that great even with the bigger battery thats apparently inside it would probably be better to get the iphone instead its still being sold on apples site and its only more than the current se if they made it or even like the rumors said it wouldve been better value and more people wouldve gotten it instead of paying an extra for an the reason why its more expensive base instead of base could be the but thats all can think of the screens still the cameras still mp the only things that are new are the new chip slightly bigger battery and thats it really
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),more frustration for apple fans nearly yrs outdated old design only saying for this rubbish phone think they still got much better options in this price range and they have to use all remaining dummies structure wat they got in their stock ridiculous
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),about iphones lasting longer it is huge myth they might last longer but it is not how you more youre typing paragraphs after paragraphs attacking this one phone are you sure you are not pressed about it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),still worse photo and video quality quite bit slower speed even though this phone has goo more lol dont talk about the battery in this atleast you are getting charger and battery would be good for years this phones battery would be horrible from day
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),people think its great getting years of updates on an iphone well let me tell you they slow your phone to crawl by the end of the updates cycle gb ram is not going to cut it in years this phone will be good for two updates max once again the battery is laughable as well never mind the reduction in screen size however look forward to getting them cheap and selling them to fools on second hand websites lol
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cancel se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),oh my god this is apple is pushing the belief that anything that they make will sell cause more the iphone se series sells like hotcakes that is why they are making it every year
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),display is too small battery will be mh mah almost
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this phone looks years old but also missing the best things phones had years ago eg more it has chip
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why they hiding battery spec maybe small cant see like battery lololllllllll
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its written there its so small that need microscope see it thanks
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),buy used iphone or mini at almost similar price and get better experience than this iphone se will be probably at least in my country and iphone mini is around wheres logic in this pricing of course would go for mini its literally logical decision
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),very excited to see the features nothing special just common chip upgrade and some softwares httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphonediff
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),seriously this screen colour for an iphone after so many years of its journey good god steve is gone for long otherwise he wouldve resign from his own company seeing this phone screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why would someone need charging its just chinese cheap feature to lure uneducate more one spotted
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),nothing wrong keeping this desing with less it would be nice option could have been the perfect cheap iphone if apple made it cheap but this way it seems not like good bargin at all
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),no matter what you say about it people will still buy it and this postarticle has comme more ultra has around comments what you are talking
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),xiaomi revives note nerfs lite and do not have ois on pro samsung lowers base more why would someone need charging its just chinese cheap feature to lure uneducated people into buying their phone cz honestly they dont have any new innovation same goes for hz panels anyone who is pc gamer knows hz is more than enough
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),dumb phone se
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),phones with equal specs were years ago did we really regress that far since then
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hey apple got two words for ya non sense
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hell ma edge beats this aint upgrading to this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),too tiny no battery amh and yet too expensive just because it is apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),very bad display ppi
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this is for those who want the ios experience without spending fortune bionic is at least two generations ahead of anything qualcomm puts out lets hope the battery life is better than the previous iphone ses gb internal storage is too little for gb should be the bare minimum the same goes for budget android phones not sure if the ongoing wars will affect the prices of hardware components for the rest of the year
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thought its which is no way in hell im buying it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),would buy this for dollar or maybe hundred no more though
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),that screen gb ram just get iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lmao imagine gb ram with buying gb version of this you rather get an iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),im trying to choose between iphone se iphone refurbished thoughts iphone se of course
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple is generating same profits from this phone what theyre making from their flagships reasons this phone has zero rnd what makes difference in this phone vs iphone evn or theyre same if youre doing basic stuff like mails and phone calls this processor is useless with the rest of the specs of this phone specially battery and display like no way youre going to enjoy those heavy games and tasks if any android had sd gen on phone from id criticize them same even androids had better battery screen size and charging speeds thn iphone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what shame another recycled phone
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),they didnt even mention the battery itself
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),need superior connectivity functionality security im not looking to film edit or watch the next oscar or emmy award video with this phone just take make phone calls read post messages share laugh buy return stuff scan sign document find where im going and have siri whisper sweet nothings in my earyou know just simple basic stuff
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why hide battery is it chew
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),funniest combo cofig have ever seen apple fans will appreciate this iphone had have one
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why still apple release iphone se with inch screen thought it should be come with inch screen
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),remember all youtubers mumbling they want black front black front so ugly wish they stop doing this
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),damn they still have tons of those iphone shells hanging around and now surplus of to get rid of gotta put them together and find some sheeps to buy them in the name of the environment of the people who was buying the version already wouldnt see single difference between it and regular iphone besides of having an even worse battery life so now theyre bringing the to it so that it gets even worse battery without noticeable difference all this at the price of xiaomi lite which actually looks like phone from besides not having it plastered in the name the irony
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),only bionic changed otha waste phone thuuuu can go for oneplus or iqoo
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),cmon and still lighting want to upgrade my phone but lighting annoy me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),lollllllllll nacho bears this in every possible way
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),oh man they rereleased iphone in the things apple does for money
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),same extremely outdated design same tiny screen same single rear camera same small battery seriously apple they didnt even try to shrink the bezels little bit cant really blame them though people will buy anything with apple logo on it anyway
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),that cheap is so under clocked it makes intel cpus look good
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),only changed to socomg
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),same as model only difference is chipset and newer os wonder who would buy this insted prev model
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),hopefully they will put in the same battery as in the iphone mah otherwise fear this iphone will be disaster and why still offer gb let gb of storage become the standard once and for all anyone have an idea of the price euros seems fair to me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),this will push the prices of the se down further know enthusiasts wont like it but appreciate that apple still provides fast compact phones when not even sony does anymore
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),its just like the version but with newer chipset for looking at benchmark results and it costs more
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),just bought me poco gt priced at mp cam mp ultra wide mp macro nm process more still worse photo and video quality quite bit slower speed even though this phone has good soc compared to what is available and is just asking for battery replacement after years mrwhosetheboss made good video recently where he has shown how cameras on these android phones can not keep up at all
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),honestly would just buy used mini for much better experience
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apples message is clear to who cant pay for their phones we know there ar more yes there are many android phone with camera or even cameras but commonly they are toy cameras of only megapixels at most welcome back to only the main camera sometimes is good high quality phones as iphone with of course high quality cameras are more expensive as the components used to make the phone are more expensive body camera biometry sensors cpu etc
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),heres hoping battery size has been improved even the mini has mah battery and is ph more apple advertises the same battery life on this phone as on the mini
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),they shouldve at least used the design great performance though gb of ram will bottleneck it somewhat expected the screen to be oled disappointed
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),enjoy your tablet ill enjoy phone instead baby hands
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),common apple we dont want these kind of old looking devices from trillion dollar company
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),really at least increase the screensize and add touch id do you people even think or just type
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),screen no thanks enjoy your tablet ill enjoy phone instead
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),been living under rock for the past year and half there are no graphene batteries only graphene enhanced marketing gimmicks that are just lithium based as well how about you bring up facts instead of randomly bawling nonsense
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),apple as always not releasing informazion on battery size claim its screen on time is hour more they said latest battery chemistry and internal design updates so it is possible that the battery got little bit bigger though thats not for sure
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),we miss you steve jobs those in position now are for sure still living in more finally someone said that agree with you
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),im very very disappointed in apple why
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),phone under mah battery os it jock
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what abig disappointment old screen old design why looks like they had some old ones left in storage room bringing it to the front store now
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),you know that lithium based batteries are the only technology used in smartphones been living under rock for the past year and half
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),haha hd lcd screen and lilon battery max you know that lithium based batteries are the only technology used in smartphones
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),boring
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),camera aperture it should be
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),finally apple you want me to say last good bye
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),just wait to see what reviewers have to say this is important not an apple presentation
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),everything is great lets just see how will be the battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),thought that apple would design full screen mobile but they disappointed me
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),still the same design still one main camera still low battery capacity its hard to believe that almost only the software and new processor can be attractive for the market
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),now thats really outdated se was fine but using this design now is so stupid just make full screen iphone atleast
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),honestly they couldve done better but lets see how it really does on reviews with the competition design is garbage but performance is gonna be top tier for the price
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),what big disappointment home button ugly bazel design instead of something new apple sux
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),why this who going to buy it
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),interesting phone specs wise but design from bezels are huge
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),mid fear
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),and what miliamps battery of the brand new iphone se maybe mah the same as se and iphone apple did promise better battery life so ig its from the software
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),unfortunately freak in form and content
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),give it more ram for gods sake
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),if it was dollars like your website reported it wouldve been great this way hell nah
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),battery no good
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),just can say
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the hype was too much for just the and upgraded chip
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),very disappointed expected so much more this is literally the same as se maybe bit more also gb of ram couldve been at least gb dont think gb is enough anymore even for apple
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),well lets see about the battery life
Apple,iPhone SE (2022),the evolution ended alone with jobs
