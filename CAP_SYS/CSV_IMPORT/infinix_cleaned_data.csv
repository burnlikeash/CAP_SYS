Infinix,GT 10 Pro,hey quick question will not often to playing when buy it and play the game that just more have gt pro and its good
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,man this is good phone except few problems infinix should at least provide xos update as it has recieved only major update so far other than that this is pretty great phone in terms of performance only con is the battery not going strong but hopefully it can be fixed if infinix provide xos update with much needed optimization
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,my phone has another update update version xhghuglv size gb more thats new upgrade to another android version tell if there is any difference
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,am using infinix gt pro and this phone performed very well until download game on this more real

Infinix,GT 10 Pro,im user infinix gt pro in not using but still hot
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,finally android not much has changed but at least they kept their promise
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,months after launch still no android and google wallet isnt working due to safety more my phone got updated to xos android yesterday in short the interface and feature still looks similar to xos but didnt dig deeper yet
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,its overheating it can reach to using mi its normal temperature is
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,very soon infinix will have problemshow can put up price like that infinix is about to lose more poor
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,not bad considering the price for this phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,tecno camon photography gt pro performance just from there its already more its performance too outstanding compare to gt pro heats up lot tunning and optimization did better with canon pro
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,bought in america and the phone wasnt compatible with the phone service carriers complete trash
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,tecno camon pro great alternative for gt pro just received android few days ago so more tecno camon photography gt pro performance just from there its already different segment
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,it have been month the phone is released lol lolmy bad typo released on
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,bought this phone last year on september for my birthday for me this phone is good for more bro in hibernation so dont know which year is this
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,remember one thing with gt ultra or gt pro dont see the features like mm audio jack sd card support they have omitted include flagship gaming processor along with ir blaster so think if you manage without those features which is so rare now days
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,should buy this phone or should wait for infinix gt ultra wait of ultra pro plus
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,hot bro
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,brocan you specify all the details of both your phones on my whatsapp am upgrading my more gt pro is better is has better inbuilt features that the camon pro doesnt like the power centralisation you can use the phone while charging it without it necessarily charging the actual phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,its working flawlessly using the better alternative camon pro better with build qualit more brocan you specify all the details of both your phones on my whatsapp am upgrading my phone so need to know which one is better techno camon pro or infinix gt pro
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,is this phone is good for heavy gaming like genshim impact it does for that have to uninstall those unwanted system apps along with the inbuilt game center or tool or space whatever the app name is for better stability get rid of heating also throttling too
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,yes play everyday works well but in high graphics settings consider using cooler its working flawlessly using the better alternative camon pro better with build quality and camera rest all specs are exact the same uninstall those unwanted system apps along with game center for better stability
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,received delivery of knockoff phone not anyway close to the infinix version he more man thats pretty unfortunate here in malaysia the price had gone up and cant find any with original price on shopee or lazada theyre all above usd and some are doesnt make sense to pay that much recommend finding used one which is around php seemed bit off for this phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,can use this phone for years will it become unusable after year best gaming phone long life
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,just bought it at total of myr or great deal for the specs probably the best more try playing king of fighters allstars so far its the most resourceshogging game ever play
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,bro this phone released on he meant
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,ion even care this phone is crazy good
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,who tf thought this phone would get gb ram who thought gb ram was possible
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,not for long time gaming hanging issue
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,please upgrade aod feature not only seconds
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,have the same issues mine with brand new gb sandisk sd card but when try with my old more try cleaning the contacts of your sd card it may work
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,the poco pro successor not the pro with portable hotspot chipset
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,issues of draining battery fast solution just lower your brightness and put on hz you will see difference use hz if your going to game believe me lower your brightness will make the battery last longer know some mfs put on max brightness and complain about the battery draining fast dont lie to me
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,thats the zero ultra its confusing realised that if buy gb or tb only then you will get big charger if order gb will get
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,wired charging ar sure shouldnt be with thats the zero ultra
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,also use this phone base on month experience yes this phone has issue in drain battery more depend on country the proper midrange smartphone that can take heavy duties is either poco or poco pro and the pricing is not much higher than this gt pro also poco or pro with snapdragon processor apps are more optimized
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,every thing is ok but mera infinix gt pro me ek paroblem hai connect nahi ho raha hai aur jio company se baat karne par wo bolra hai hai ki aapka headset compatible devices nahi hai only the major problem
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,someone know about the eu declaration of conformity for infnix gt pro or similar such as united statesfcc canadaic brazilanatel taiwanncc hong kongofca japanmic or chinacccco
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,my infinix gt pro battery drain very quickly been using it for about months now does an more also use this phone base on month experience yes this phone has issue in drain battery too fast common issue that most of user always time use hz display enhance your display can drain the battery actually so just edit the mode for daily purpose for hz and only use high frame rate hz for gaming optional where most game play in hz can be satisfied gaming more than hours straight using this phone can produce massive heat simple solution use fan cooler at the back or play in the ac room this phone also cannot be comparible to other gaming flagship phone where open application and above still can the battery not drain too fast so the solution just need to alert your phone only open application at the same time for saving the battery practically yeah with the current price cannot to give so high expectation but as user still satisfied with the upper midrange phone and saving lots money
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,have issue when using gb microsd it kept dismounted everytime the device locked and scr more what it means is that the phone is no compatible with the gb or maybe the maximum storage it can take is gb or gb
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,hows infinix phone durability in general dont mean whether they could stand get more can use this phone for years will it become unusable after year
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,when we charge it with the original charger the screen becomes goshttouch why does that happen has anyone experienced something similar
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,my only problem with this phone is the heating issue suggest using phone cooler and the build of the phone itself
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,heating issues hours only charging backup
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,between vivo and oppo as has the same price as this phone comparing those two with this is just miles away
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,this phone have best performance but is sometimes it heats up quickly and overhit for hot bac more this is as like flagship phoneif want buy it need buy fancooler too however performance is very good
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,can someone reply my comment is it good for call of duty mobile ofcourse bro codm is small game
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,infinix gt pro vs tecno pova pro which is actually better and they both seem to be gamin more the infinix win in many places bludamoled screenlighter weightthin bezelsbetter chipsetmore storagebetter camera and its got under display fingerprintthe tecno only wins in the charging speed tho
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,brought this phone days ago great performance heating think is normal back cover feel more hope to read more about your experience with the phone am gamer and considering buying this phone been searching about this device cause my budget is limited nowadays so need to make sure its worthy enough
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,use this phone for almost mths almost prefect budget gaming phone its back cover heat up quite easily coz the cover is thin and can improve the heat dissipating performance not bad for mid range phone with antutu score of around kquite decent for the price you paiddimensity is rebrand dimensity but still decent mid range cpu
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,using this phone from month almost it has bit hitting use cooler and battery draining issue and if you can deal with it it will be the best choice than poco never recommend poco it dies and for its cheap components but this phone is really satisfying rebranded flagship processor with dual the design ufs charging speed dedicated os no fears to update like miui no fears of greenline
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,just bought today so far great performance bro ok but where did you get it
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,where can buy this smartphone in europe or are there any noneuropean websites that send th more just bought today so far great performance bro
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,bought infinix hot note zero for my family all of them still in usage wor more nice
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,the phone is really great phone even thor dont get considering its price think this is not just fear its more than fear enough
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,for poco or for gt pro all day but dont think you can have it for its about here
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,in my country poco is so much better than this gt pro as it is just slightly more expens more your dead wrong
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,poco or is better value but despite it has gb still able to run more fps in gaming beca more in my country poco is so much better than this gt pro as it is just slightly more expensive for the similar gb version simply is nobrainer choice what mean slightly is just around being usd more expensive the rest of course is up to your choice because of different opinion
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,they said years of security patches and yr if os update only one os update
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,after updating battery train problem solved or not please tell please reply slow
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,does it has ir blasters
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,according to the official infinix websitethey promised android updates for the phonebut ma more they said years of security patches and yr if os update
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,after updating to the latest version of the patch everything runs smoothly playing genshin impact at the highest setting is also very smooth stable fps even though the temperature is very hot unless you use funcooler it is very stable moved from mi user redmi note poco pro black shark to kingfinix user now
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,ill check it when get the phone have you checked it please confirm
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,how many android update does this phone will have in the future nvm was dumb it actually said years period starting from the global launch date of the gt proat least one update to the next major version of android will be guaranteed
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,not good battery drain fast and heating problem
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,can it run high graphic on genshin impact its gonna throttle heavily concerning for its longevity if gaming is really your forte poco is better competitor
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,similar performance same with snapdragon can it run high graphic on genshin impact
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,did it work for you in the us how can get that unit here in the philippines as of now can find it in any store want to buy that unit even infinix note vip so please tell me how to purchase that in the philippines
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,tried to buy this phone off aliexpress that was linked here and after week the seller sent more did it work for you in the us
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,got my phone after importing to canada and taking the risk dont seem to be able to use more am travelling to uk so it will work outside of india on other local sim of uk
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,seems to be good all rounder phone it could be better if it had normal simple backpan more if you neither do not want that gamer look note vip is the option
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,whate date will gt pro release in ph same to infinix note vip
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,nah at idr ish its straightup robbery lmao it is still great deal though if you dont care about software updates and cameras much
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,purchased this phone for which is half more of its actual price at bangladesh yeah every products get such pricing here and though it unofficial but the phone is overkiller imagine buying stuffs at more than its actually in us and eu while there peoples has greater wages the world is truly unfair gc prices are almost double too
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,price in here very worh it
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,it heats and drains bit when you bought it new after you used it long term the device will more what nonsense very funny
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,too much heating on play game
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,does this phone really have heating battery drain issue in indonesia ppl complain abou more daily use on this would be an overkill but you will enjoy using it until it breaks depending on how you treat the phone you can expect to last longer like to years
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,yoo its only in indonesia that is more than great deal
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,battery backup is too bad at my battery percentage is and now its more also noticed that too on the infinix note and they tend to last hrs from only if youre on screen throughout with data turned on but when data is not turned on abd youre not doing anything on whatsapp or youtube just probably watching movies you downloaded it can last for day
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,too bad it wont work in the us because its region locked
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,uses mediatek dimensity mt is more expensive than this phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,processor same specs as xiaomi non pro lol uses mediatek dimensity mt
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,have an iphone pro already so the camera on the infinix gt pro is not big deal for me at all its great phone and superb creative design would totally recommend this phone for others
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,it have gosht touch fingerprint under displaynot side mounted too bad because like this more hows your experience with the zero im also considering it since its good phone with ips display
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,this is nice looking device and its well priced but honestly would just add bit more money and buy the new realme gt neo se
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,did someone buy the phone is the device good please answer me yes im using it since th august the device is really good and its performance is at par with redmi ki takes average photos device will be more smooth if you can debloat some infinix and other apps normal usage with gives hrs of screen on time with days of battery backup gaming performance is also good but not suggested for continuous gaming for hrs with device will get hot overall better device if you dont care about updates and camera and just need device for daily usage with lag free performance
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,mp depth why not put mp or mp ultrawide it would be much useful all the specs and appearance looks good on all series that came out just the camera lenses that made me not buy one
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,its only around dollar at indonesia is now only
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,anyway more notification light feels useless to me because it only works for no more than seconds for all features it cant be as long as we want
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,no ultra wide camera what do you want with that price this is make sense with that price bro this phone for user gaming not for camera
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,wtf hahaha its only in indonesia yeah its really no brainer for the price
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,so did some digging but unfortunatelly there is not lot could find however im more httpsyoutubeufspemfg it can withstand scratch up to lv
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,that many feature but no display protection at all pass
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,year infinix is known for not updating android of its phones so its better than nothing more hardly any different than any other chinese oems in the price segment
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,aliexpresss delivery is two month after payment thats too long yes but the phone is still in its first moments of release it was the same with zero ultra when got my zero pro from their store in aliexpress they took just days to ship the phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,android os updates year infinix is known for not updating android of its phones so its better than nothing for now security updates comes regularly
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,amazing phone for its price speaker just average with trebble domination bypass charging is cool and dedicated microsd card slot is available clean xos with no bloatware but this phone will only get major os upgarde is another issue tho come on infinix give at least os upgrade
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,what you have written is not fair to infinix and to yourself it shows the way your mind works you are envious of infinix the device has not been released yet you call it scrap if you are not interested in infinix phones you better leave them alone infinix phones are good and am proud of the one am using for its solid build and performance once again stop discouraging infinix customers one mans meat is another mans poison
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,its nice in the specs but yet this is infinix its not durable have an infinix hot its still rocking until today even in used conditions used as work device the screen is durable even several drops only problem is volume buttons gone missing
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,no wifi
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,no ois
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,want to know when infinix gt pro will hit nigeria market when when your prince will stop wanting to share financial schemes with the rest of the world
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,well gt pro just appeared in aliexpress for roughly aliexpresss delivery is two month after payment thats too long
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,on side note infinix zero specs are being leaked chipset aside for my more im honestly curious about the mp selfie camera zero has mp with ois which was great but not exactly perfect due to limited capacities of curved amoled display is also something only seen on ultra but it seems they will use on nonultra as well
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,it was the same store from where imported my zero pro for less than half of gt pro curr more on side note infinix zero specs are being leaked chipset aside for my preferences that sounds like better phone and if that will feature an ultrawide with af or even maybe telephoto camera it will definitely be better deal it should at least have said ultrawide with af as even the zero had it
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,deleted post it was the same store from where imported my zero pro for less than half of gt pro current price at this price gt pro is easily beaten by other brands on side note infinix zero specs are being leaked curved amoled screen mp selfie camera mp main camera gb ram gb internal storage there are mentions about the display being bit color and glassleatherlike back finish
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,can this phone play genshin impact on max settings no
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,best of the best literally considering rupee price tag bought the tecno camon pro last month which in reality is the same phone as this infinix gt pro if we look at both phones they are near identical in dimensions specs display ports battery and even camera placement it is just strategic move that transsion holding had decided to go with infinix brand to focus on gaming centric alternative of camon pro whereas gt pro comes with bigger faster storage camon pro provides better rear camera with ois so last month tecno camon pro on amazon india came with unreal offer and got the gb variant of camon pro this phone normally sells for in india this time exchanged my wifes nine year old near dead motorola moto and got an exchange value of with additional off on exchange after adding additional flat discount on any card it all came down to this is an unreal price for such device you see these deals once in blue moon tecnos hios android overlay over android is near identical to xos found on my infinix note device both comes with huge customization options like most of them but some are of no use the other thing noted on camon pro is there is hardly any rd party bloatware preinstalled hence no unwanted notifications on other hand it comes with many st party softwares from tecno itself you can uninstall or disable most of them and then it becomes clean experience both phones comes with the best soc you can ever get under am talking about the mediatek dimensity based of tsmc nm fabrication process this soc is direct descendent of dimensity so it just blows all previous socs available in this price segment out of the water in terms of pure performance when coupled with gb lpddrx ram everything you try just glides as feels butter smooth in operation of camon pro am not heavy gamer though on audio front too it has everything covered dts certified dual stereo speakers which are loud the god sent mm hires certified audio jack is also present am yet to speak about its camera performance which is one of the best you can get for this price on the back of camon pro we get mp primary camera which uses quadbayer pixel setup and hence captures mp stills by default it is the samsung skgwb sensor isocell sensor the sensor also has rgbw arrangement replacing part of the green pixels of traditional rggb array with white ones the alleged benefit from that is the better quality of light captured by the sensor this sensor adorned with total of lenses in front one of which is made of real glass element instead of plastic one here am not going to discuss about those two useless mp macro and depth sensors enough of hardware specs now about real world experience the stills taken on daylight have plenty of detail balanced contrast with great dynamic range if have to netpick will say the colors seems to be tad muted in mp mode shots have much more details than mp default ones my advice would be on bright daylight to always shoot on mp mode so as to get much more detailed images downside is we will be dealing with large files have also tested some portrait shots on main sensor and be it human or nonhuman subjects separation are excellent and the background blur is pleasing we can also do digital zoom on main camera and pictures look very comparable to their counterparts kudos to tecno for providing us very good daylight photography in the end for the price paid camon pro is an awesome device you just cannot go wrong for this device am certain the same hold for gt pro
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,good phone im thinking to buy it there is nothing you want want to tell meas far as price is concernedthis is the best
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,does it have otg no
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,super phone

Infinix,GT 10 Pro,do not wanna hear that you dont want to but have to
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,infinix should produce mini version of this unit its just dope really it wont be possible to fit these specs then
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,relax this is infinix note vip the downgrade version so its must cheaper than more ive replied before regarding note vip and the soon to be release gt pro which should be cheaper to buy because it does not have the vips wireless charging features and base and the sound is not jbl am eager to see this phone as it as touted as infinix st real gaming phone that has some type of cooling builtin
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,tecno and infinix are both the same as mention tecno and infinix because their ui looks copi more know know both tecno and infinix are under transsion holdings which is also from china
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,nope they are based in shenzen china it mustve taken you to that website because you more tecno and infinix are both the same as mention tecno and infinix because their ui looks copied from each other

Infinix,GT 10 Pro,wow youre spending tons of money for your hobby yeah thats usually how hobbies work
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,nice specs for the price yep good replacement for my redmi
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,nice specs but the price is high because it cant be upgraded redmi is better more think it is better than redmi imo
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,mr gandhi aug waitthere is no protection for the displaythey should have given some protectionalso more it does have protection
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,what the heck is mpx sensor with that small size infinix has special talent in making an more in my opinion it is quiet decent camera just not as good as my iphone pro but it is good
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,the processor is lame nope
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,may be this will be new game changer in smartphone world best smartphone of this year lets see any other comes or not with greater package
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,do you really need an ip rating for lowend phone even if your cellphone spills water it more interestingly enough it does have an ip rating actually dont need gorilla class protection this problem can actually be replaced with tempered glass and hardcase yeah good thing the gt pro comes with hard case and glass screen protector
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,so no ip rating cas of vapor chamber no glass protection no ios year security update more do you really need an ip rating for lowend phone even if your cellphone spills water it can still be used actually dont need gorilla class protection this problem can actually be replaced with tempered glass and hardcase so that the hp is safer when it falls and about ios if you cant afford an iphone just buy android buy what you can afford if you cant forget it so simple like me my budget is only so just bought poco
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,whats the glass protection gg gg victus and where we can find the claim about more so did some digging but unfortunatelly there is not lot could find however im considering buying this phone in fact will if my usual site that order from will sell it which is alza in this case after getting my hands on it and using it ill come back to this comment section with updates until then here are the things that could find so there is this site that states the infinix note vip which is what this device is based on has gorilla glass victus httpsunboxdiariescominfinixnotevipfullreviewblitzingaheadevenfurtherbeyond when searched for does the infinix note vip have gorilla glass google came up with this answer the infinix note vip has inch amoled display with full hd resolution of pixels it has hz refresh rate aspect ratio and peak brightness of nits the display is also protected by corning gorilla glass victus however this other site is stating no gorilla glass at all while many other sites state gorilla glass being present but not the version of it my opinion on the whole thing is that think its gorilla glass but for real trustworthy information we have to wait as these phones are too new httpswwwoispicecominfinixnotevipspecificationsprosandcons then there is water and dust resistance and it is rated at ip which is not the best but at this price point it will do as for the software infinixs own website says the following pure xos also includes regular security updates and patches to ensure safe and optimal gaming experience over time very vague know httpswapinfinixmobilitycomlearnglobalarticle
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,phone is epic in buget cool features and camra proosecesser and display and kp video record charge ing best in buget all are buget phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,no glass protection no ios it does have glass protection and mean of course more whats the glass protection gg gg victus and where we can find the claim about infinix update policy
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,for that price think the phone has got some decent specs infinix has done good job for budget to midrange phone in my opinion
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,nice phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,this phone has almost everything one needs in phone plus points for dimensity battery power delivery high res dual speaker and main camera ois
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,was looking at this to replace my over years old poco gt but then found out the soc on this is more or less the same or even worse than the one on my old phone
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,just basically note vip waiting for indonesia price of it
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,for eur is good but like camera seems horrible mpmpmp what setup is that processor seems decent for eur plenty for most tasks
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,does this come with bundled microscope in the box why would it
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,amazing features like it
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,want this this is the phone was looking for loooooooooooong time
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,dank look at that spec sheet and bet infinix will sell that cheaper price than poco pro
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,jack dual simsd cardchip cheap indian rupee after discount take this more its look already good to me
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,this guy is what im waiting for my expected spec and great price too im waiting its coming
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,phone is good but camera of infinix phone is vrey bad wait till some reviews come out
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,dedicated expandable memory yeah it has significance despite huge internal storage stereo speakers respectable processor mah battery distinct looks seems good package
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,for the price cant complain that much other than them having to put in an ultrawide camera fr its already quite acceptable
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,no ultrawide camera sad definitely great gaming smartphone with an ugly camera setup

Infinix,GT 10 Pro,waitthere is no protection for the displaythey should have given some protectionalso only one year updatewtf
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,great phone overall but if it had the same set of cameras of zero pro it would be twice unbeatable for this price hopefully they do that on pro and finally debut that charging with an even stronger chipset
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,hope it reaches my region
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,really its mighty thunderbest killer gaming mobile
Infinix,GT 10 Pro,anything usb is no no for me
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,my phone is automatically restart while playing game due to this have many lost my game id more did this phone have another problems like fps dropsshutdownscrashesand any other kind of problem cause im planning to buy this phone cause the back looks cool need info from user which is you my king
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,why no usb displayport this is just because you couldnt pay more not because of the problem of the smartphone itself even without this feature think not much affect daily usage
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,activate developer mode and disable automatic updates dont want to upgrade xos more my phone is automatically restart while playing game due to this have many lost my game id ban in free fire dont purchase this mobile
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,yes this brand is not good gave another shot to this brand and still the issue of restarti more well at least mine dont simply restart and stay quite cold even on moderate gaming and moderate usage yes if floor it for heavy stuff it does overheat which is quite normal for smartphone all in all of you are looking for something close to dimensity performance then this is an alternative it might not be perfect as it is already using outdated tech but for what it is it is worth for recommendation know at the time of writing this is no more best bang for buck buy at my region this brand faced strong competition from price war with poco brand where can get dimensity poco pro cheaper than dimensity infinix gt pro same gb then poco gb is also get discounted close to the price choice is yours
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,what are you do with game paly all games see lag problem in android is not good for gam more hope we can change this battery to silicon or graphene battery in the future
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,is you infinix gt pro restarting on its own yes this brand is not good gave another shot to this brand and still the issue of restarting are still there thought it was only to their infinix zero variant but unfortunately to their other variant too stop buying this brand ever since

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,noticed in android this phone finally supports photo raw capture via rd party apps like lightroom and opencamera iirc it doesnt support raw in android
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,can say its more worth it to buy poco pro for and extra few dollars and way bett more as most ppls reply to this the only reason you buy gt pro is for the looks at least the performance camera specs etc are at decent level for purely priceperformance you dont buy gt pro

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,bought this phone to use it in editing photos due to its big storage space my disappointed with its ai gallery is it only has two options of sorting out the photos newest to oldest and oldest to newest other phones have multiple sorting options like by date by name date taken date modified date created ascendingdescendingetc with gt pro the moment you photos get to the gallery they get mixed up even when they were well arranged in the previous device thats big let down

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,gt pro when gaming mode the joystick will freeze while in game off the fingers screenshot lol
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,it is smooth for games but you may encounter unresponsiveness or ghost touch and also have to mention that this phone has really weak build quality so just single drop can already mess up its performance ive been an infinix gt pro user since its release and im already experiencing the issues after months
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,does anyone know if there is legit custom rom for this
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,android release this month finally received mb firmware update after so long but there is not much info of what update and fix on this patch believe after this update it will take another at least months for another update to arrive

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,hello im looking to switch from pocox pro which was my phone for years alread more suggest you to wait for gt pro to release because gt will have better hz and better chipi hope lol but yeah just wait for the gt pro all can say
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,why get poco pro for almost similar pricing because can get more with it also with almost the same price can also get poco pro also in my country you could also top up bit mor to get gb of pro and pro moelre future proof
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,what you think about poco pro who is better why chose gt pro because of dedicated gaming display chip stable frame rate engine clean pure os
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,overall the experience just feel like poco brand of smartphone has lot of customization more to be honest rather get gt pro because its up to me
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,no new firmware for many months good hardware but the update policy really sucks it takes ye more android release this month
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,nah warzone mobile always struggled to run for android phone even some flagship device can more not all the android phones cant run warzone mobile smoothly not for galaxy ultra thats for sure hhhh
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,recently bought gbgb version for around is total steal it has almost everything midrange smartphone need to be maybe minus some premium thing such as wireless charging extra ip rating better stereo speaker which is tune by jbl no esim support nfc are all intact gesture control work really well the phone feel premium for its design surprisingly very thin bezel android auto works as it is maybe just maybe due to the mediatek chipset the wifi is not as strong just slightly worse than snapdragon then no support for aptx but still support bluetooth aac pending test on ldac all in all know there are better option out there if top up just little bit more maybe creep into or for proper poco series this one with the discounted price is no brainer choice doesnt bother with gb of physical ram dont do much multitasking
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,phone that cant even play warzone mobile nah warzone mobile always struggled to run for android phone even some flagship device cant render the game properly what did you expect for cheap midrange phone as long it can run other game smoothly fps on mid graphics its fine
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,my current phone is so old and laggy cant contend with it anymore so im saving more lag issue in just days using and screen display worsth
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,one of the best budget gaming phone true budget gaming phone its not high end gaming phone but still good gaming like how budget it is with rgb light even give mp camera have gaming mode control bypass charging for me it balance and gaming budget even give built in radio type no jack probably for long term just dont like they make this model by glasses its easy scratch and crack hopefully infinix continue making budget gaming phone or infinix gt pro
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,does this one have micro sd card slot
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,think we just need freezer app through an update pre installed as better fix all infinix phones come with it wasnt expecting this one not to
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,its been months surprisingly this very good phone for me played diablo immortal buttery smooth even if many monsters on screen the phone still performed well
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,to be honest didnt expect to be that good for didnt have any problem in gaminglast update fix that heating problem battery in holding really good around hours on pubg mobile on fpsonly minus in camera is not ultra lets be real but the videos and photos are decent and it is something different design from iphone and samsung they do the same design for years

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,and the price will be deal lol how phone with mid rang prossessor and bad quality camera will cost more than
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,infinix gt pro is better than poco because used both of the phone infinix gt pro is better than poco fin what way is it betterthe poco fs performance is almost times better than thisthe display is also betterthe charger is faster and think the camera is better too think the only thing that stays the same between the phones is the battery lifeboth have bad battery life and id say the infinix gt pros design is arguably better than the fs if youre into those mecha ahh lookin back designoh and the infinix got led light or something on its back so thats cool and you can use it as notification led or something like that
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,such good phone even at gb ram
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,after month of using this phone it very good for daily gaming play honor of kings fps drop
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,cool phone very good used it for months havent experienced lag and very fast and good fps and nice settings on heavy duty games such as codm but the only downside to this phone is overheat but overall its good phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,so far its very nice worth the price question though does it not have an earphone jack cant find it
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,great phone just basic game not supported warzone mobile and sometimes it overheat while gaming luckily come with cooler fan
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,how do you turn off mobile data on certain apps
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the battery backup is just doom it doesnt lasts more regret buying it
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,so im having thoughts on which one should get wanted to buy phone solely for gam more infinix gt pro is better than poco because used both of the phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,there is no ois this is gaming phone oriented in the official specs no ois written stop misleading people the infinix gt pro does indeed have ois its even in the spec sheet on the official site for the phone camera rear mpoissamsung hm fov lensaf mpmp
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the overheating problem is finally fixed with the latest update now they only need to fix th more bought this gt and in my observation in weeks of test in games and normal used there is no issuesyou said there is battery draining in your phone gt maybe you install so many ruuning in backgrounds appyou need to uninstall the apps that running in background even not in used as of now in my everyday use there is no issues even in gaming
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,im sorry but can you verify that this is the update version of your gt pro update ver more dont afraid it is so nice update there is no heating issue
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,theres no fps in cod im very sad
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,ever since the latest software update the phones been properly brilliant not overheati more im sorry but can you verify that this is the update version of your gt pro update version xhcfuopv am really afraid to update this thinking this overheating and battery draining problem might become worse plz reply
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,os very clean infinix no lie to us gt pro so smooth played honor of king pubg so good
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,its been one week ive used this phone the dm sure is powerful yet if your planning gaming on this phone better purchase rechargeable cooling fan especially if your planning set it to high settings in competitive scenarios if you dont have cooling fan better set it to power saver mode so the temperature will be tolerable to play with when comes to battery yeah it will last day for normal usage the charging time is pretty fast and if youre planning to buy this phone better update it first
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,wish it can support gcam
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,why no gyro eis
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,purchase the phone at first the bottom part of the screen seems not working properly but over all the phone functionality are great it pull up the apps faster than any of my android phones before
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,im about to buy phone and im wondering if should go for this one poco pro or just the regular gaming wise regular should handle it better than pro and gt camera wise gts way better than the other performance wise pro is cut above the other was originally planning to buy the regular but am contemplating if its os could keep up til at most so im having hard time to decide since both pro and gt has better os should opt for these or just wait for few more phone releases in the following months im from the philippines btw guys help me decide pls
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,how come this is somewhat inferior to the poco pro when they have similar chipsets and ram more just performs better than they are not identical is plain better assuming you dont play max game settings on both devices it probably doesnt matter much just get whichever suits your budget also keep note gt pro only has gb storage option you might want to get the other one for larger storage options if you are planning to install lot of games as gt pro owner all can say is it has good main camera and good looking design design is probably the real reason why ppl buying gt pro anyway
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,it should be able to handle those games but make sure you use that cooler for those heavy game more how come this is somewhat inferior to the poco pro when they have similar chipsets and ram choices gt mediatek dimensity ultimate nm malig mc poco pro mediatek dimensity ultra nm mali gmc im only bit hesitant because gt is significantly cheaper here compared to the pro
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,im planning on buying one and was wondering if it still includes the gaming kit no more it is sold separately
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,latest firmware update fix the corner touch area not responding some times my experience has been amazing so far keep the display at hz and the phone dont even feel warm when playing ml in performance mode it also allow you to disable almost all the google stuff only wuthering waves can make this phone warm at hz
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,it kinda good if you only want an gaming phone and if you have good temp in your area ca more im planning on buying one and was wondering if it still includes the gaming kit
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,have only used it to play mobile legends and honkai star rail and so far after one week of more never had any crashes before and im multitasking im using the latest this oct firmware updates
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,gaming poco and can be used normally but looks infinix for sure it kinda good if you only want an gaming phone and if you have good temp in your area cause this phone can easily turn the heat up you enable it to hrz so you should use it with gaming cooler so far so good not ghostouching or etc recommend this phone if you want to get phone with good refresh rate and have an good temp
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,for real the pic quality is soo good bro the phone too sharp
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,bought both phones and the gt pro is better overall phone better pics and vids as well more for real the pic quality is soo good
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,dont recommend buying this it has alot of issues when you use it for gaming especiall more which phone company you belong
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,any one playing fortnite on gt pro
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,only good infinix phone imo
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,coming from infinix zero pro want to upgrade to phone ordered this phone because it more finally got it no complain all good
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,its kinda nice with limited budget but sadly some of its features are not working at all when my notification is on mute but not the others the sounds still come until and unless mute the phone itself the sound still come
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the camera on redmi note pro is not up to mega pexl because the processor only support more nah bro xiaomi makes mp on redmi note pro because they tune the camera can take up to mp and then they tune this chipset into ultra to make the camera become mp lemme explain in easiest way so this ultra is tuned by xiaomi to maximize their camera meanwhile ultimate is tuned by infinix to maximize this chipset performance up to conclussion ultra can maximize the camera but with the same performance
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,its great phone but have very big problem have had gt in the past month because thought the first one was faulty the bottom left of the screen its sometimes unresponsive when press it let me explain it in an easier way imagine youre playing pubg and someone hits you from far away and you cant see him so the only solution is to prone but heres the problem because of the unresponsive sensor on the bottom left of the screen couldnt prone it has happened to me more than times infinixif youre seeing this please fix it cause whats the point of gaming phone if cant play games properly
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,if really want good photos just buy redmi note pro bcs it has larger sensor but if more the camera on redmi note pro is not up to mega pexl because the processor only support mega pexl hello ultra
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,hey just here to ask about the known spreading issues of this phone does it really gho more just disable fingers screenshot
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,guys help me out this bad boy infinix gt pro with mediatek dimensity ultimate vs xia more if really want good photos just buy redmi note pro bcs it has larger sensor but if want performance and videos go for gt prooverall gt pro
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,own pro and this brand could own poco if they started to use the latest chipset it has passthrough charging at this price interpolation chip front blitz with mp front camera and leds and infinix software is better especially their gaming hub poco has dumped game space to the fake it until you make it route with misleading fps counter and no realtime gpucpu usage like they had with the pro miui they removed it for no reason power user brand that did this im honestly tired of having to use adb foss side loaded apps scene shizuku just to get working fps meter only to see its not even possible to get gpu load because mtk is more closed than apple and is restricting gpu usage access permission for other apps while providing none of their own just says on gpu load with any app dont think poco has anything else than fake gimmicks left to play hyperos is half baked worse version than miui they only have arguably good cooling solutions left make infinix phone and ill buy it or same chipset vs price to the competition im not gonna lie releasing an month old mid range chipset when that segment has had the most progress the past years wasnt really good idea doubt the price difference between and is more than and its arm generations ahead id gladly pay that on top of this phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,poco pro or gt pro for gaming and normal use gaming poco and can be used normally but looks infinix for sure
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,like infinix gt pro good spec for its price but the one thing dont like about this phone is its temperature which can go up to by just playing ml for minutes to an houri use mobile data even pairing it with phone cooler the temperature is almost still the same maybe because of its chipset dimensity no hate but regreted not buying sd phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,dont forget for bypass charging
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,amazing phone gt pro can record at fps with oiseis work simultaneusly while pro cant even cant do that
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,ive been using gt pro since release so far no problem even survived drop from second floor mind that it does have case and tempered glass but for those people asking gt pro or poco pro the answer is pro is better on almost any corner charging screen asside the fact that gt have hz but most games dont even use that and alot faster chip so for gaming buy pro but if you want the looks go for gt pro also the software support of infinix is trash so if longevity is big deal for you another win for poco pro im not biased just stating facts again dodnt encounter any problem on my gt pro yet but if will choose between this phone will go for pro this gt is gifted to me so dont say then choosed gt xd
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,im gamer play last day on earth pubg new state codm mcpe into the dead and and crossy road should buy gt pro or poco pro for gaming and normal usage
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,lot of people asking whats the best phone between this one and poco pro my suggestion is if you want headaches about ghost touch with green board prefer to buy this one compared to pro
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,what should get then infinix gt pro or the iphone can you help me go for android to save money
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,go for samdung or iphone the have great network strength what should get then infinix gt pro or the iphone can you help me
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,does this unit have sd card slot no
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,what about signal reception ability of infinix gt pro in low network area infinix my place more signal depends on your network provider

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,cortex gt cortex poco pro do research
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,theres no ois ultrawide cam and gyroeis in this price range its gaming phone not camera fone treat it like one
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,for those complaining why the battery is draining please note that this is dual chip phone that means not only the soc is driving the display thats the reason why the battery seems lackluster the phone does have fast charging to counter that though
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the thing im kinda disappointed in this phone is the software not that polished and smooth unlike the xiamok phones the screen sometimes is unresponsive had to restart to fix it back the battery quickly drains the edges is annoying cant click the edges too sometimes it ruins my mood in gaming cant focus hope future updates will fix this
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,after using it for about weeks without ever being dropped or hit the camera suddenly turned more faulty unit take back to service centre
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,does the xboost ultra frame rate and hdr thing works on all games or just specific games it works actually on call of duty mobile pubg farlight asphalt series mobile legendsgenshin impact modern warships diablo immortal on refresh rate high settings with its cooler it maintains degrees celsius temperature for an hour straight playing
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,this or xiaomi note pro plus this one much better if you think of gaming only not photography
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,why doesnt this have review like the previous infinix its one of the most popular phone right now
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,this phones battery could be better mean take look at tecno pova from few years ago that has massive mah battery if only tecno supports pd that time it would be loved by fans relatively cheap phone with massive battery and gpu that works well with every day to day basics with mild gaming is actually good than having gaming one and battery that cant even support it halfway throughout the day
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,im using type to mm jack brand vention all working well include wow radio you just need an adapter like type adapter for mm headphone jack
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the auto rotation doesnt work on this phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,infinix phones have feature that stops the device from charging once its fully charged yeah just like every other phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,can leave my infinix gt pro charging overnight is safe or not infinix phones have feature that stops the device from charging once its fully charged
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,can leave my infinix phone charging overnight
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,heres review of the infinix gt pro highlighting some problems and issues after more do we need dac audio jack or non dac audio jack is fine

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,can anyone solve the blur graphics in pubg its focus mode by xboost to gain battery life and less load for gpu they split ur screen as focus and non focus areas so may see blur in non focus areas this doesnt fluctuate ur fps
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,does usb typec earphone work on this airpod sucks its delayed when hearing sounds in games use audionic earbuds for gaming am also using signature earbud of audionic with this device
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the battery is very weak it cannot be used for long according to me the battery should be be more with high wattage charger nowadays battery capacity is no longer important spec more battery capacity equals less components installed
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,so should you buy the poco xpro or infinix gt pro are you using bypass charging when gaming or not
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,agree the battery does drain bit fast when playing games secondly alot of apps cant be optimized draining the battery further the battery for this type of phone should have been to mah nothing less
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,why my gt is heating too much cant play game even charging time also its to mu more it has bypass charge option use it for charging and gaming it reduces heating as it directly powers motherboard not battery

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,ads can be disabled thru multiple methods so that criticism against chinese brands is already moot how many users are able to do that out of users either wont bother or doesnt know how to do it the ads are kinda annoying like disabled everything but after week the ads on the file manager suddenly pops out of nowhere and it is really annoying dont know why xiaomi keeps on doing it on their phones even after being able to disable them it must have been the may update that led to that crappy ad on the file manager it is like your old neighbor suddenly dumping trash in front of your house even if youve been neighbors for decade already
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,hows the battery of gt pro in terms of gaming hours it lasts in heavy gaming to hours battery backup on heavy gaming if use cooler with your power bank or without cooler it heats little bit on bgmi but it giver hours backup

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,next phone should have dedicated sd card slot as far as the camera goes it would be good if there was only one powerful camera which could take care of everything would be cool if there was flash on the front camera as well
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,week after got this phone the battery life is improving by the day looks like the phone is beginning to adjust to my usage pattern could be better but am confident that firmware update is coming to make the battery life better

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,perfect fone for gaming no doubt camera is also good very smooth fone only negative point is battery drais fast ss compared to other other infinix fones may because of hz display
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,is that phone support mirco sd card
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,even snapdragon is better than this in emulators but snapdragon guess stronger more the snapdragon came into use in
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,suggest best hone for gaming with andreno poco
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,get urself snapdragon processor theyre the best for emulationmali perform badly suggest best hone for gaming with andreno
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,temperature playing pubg compared to gt pro
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,if you guys want to emulate dont buy phones with mali gpus buy phones with adreno snapdragon way better for emulation look for phones with gen to have similar normal mobile gaming experience as yet better emulator gaming or better yet look for phones with or sg to have way better experience in both normal
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,not bad when it comes to the price but is it global just double checking
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,yes is good get urself snapdragon processor theyre the best for emulationmali perform badly
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,can you tell me how it performs on ps emulation on aethersx is it good even snapdragon is better than this in emulators but snapdragon guess stronger than both even though ot was old chip in
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,how does it perform on ps emulation on aethersx like mortal kombat shaolin monks etc is more yes is good
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,it has powerful chipsetso yes it can ty
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,anyone who bought this phone may you tell me something about the durability am planning to get this phone but im careless person so im scared that ill drop the phone and the glass will crack easily on this phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,bought one of this in malaysia works perfect but since work in cruise ships weeks later cellphone locked impossible to contact no body if you travelling often this brand is not for you all this devices has geolocking has been week since place the complain and still waiting toss in to the garbage
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,ive been use this phone for about weeks can say this is one of the best midrange phone for gaming so far right now this phone can handle any ultra ultra setting without having frame drop so far with esport mode with pixelwork this phone can manage genshin impact fps more smoothly like working in fps so far havent any issue with this phone no ads bloatware can easily to uninstall camera is okay
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,id go with the if you dont care about gaming the curved screen and the more its so hard to find screen replacements for it it scratches so easily most of the scratches is on the frame of phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,does the codm set to ultra graphics can set lowultra or very highmax
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,this or zero id go with the if you dont care about gaming the curved screen and the charger makes that worth it choice although this one isnt bad either
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,which lpddr type ram does this have lpddrx gbs
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,received the phoneoverall not bad for the price light os with hz it make it phone more does the codm set to ultra graphics
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,so downloaded the camera probe app and it says it dont support lvl but it says more yes thats ois but that doesnt mean the camera sensor doesnt have ois hardware as youll find it supports ois video in the phone camera app it just means rd party apps like instagram cant access ois of the camera sensor cause phone doesnt have level support and cant output stabilized video
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,how can get wholesale mobile infinix and tecno
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,yes snapdragon is always better than dimensity due to more optimization but the problem is sna more download speed maximum receive around gbps never received this speed with gen devices
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,very good device gb ram no lacks sound tuned by jbl hz very clean firmware no any objection purchased in ksa sr will all extra accessories game controller also
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,wish could afford this phone its looks amazing and the pubg mobile collaboration made it better infact the whole infinix gt verse is superb just wished ghanaian like me could afford it
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,can you check if this phone has level camera api support you can check with camera api pr more it says in the app lvl is not supported but full is supported dont care about its cameras much but at stabilisation part optical is not supported is that ois is absent
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,man if poco fixed their temp and battery issues they would have great gaming driver it more use too poco obviously limiting play mobile legend ultra ultra when it start heating up fps drop today receive my gt pro still downloading but so far heating issue not too much here
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,really want this phone but its not release in indonesia yet
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,really dont know what to think about this phone have been using oppo my whole life more what you go swimming with your phone on your pants
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,do you think ppl buy this phone for its camera while the phone clearly advertised for gamers more can you check if this phone has level camera api support you can check with camera api probe app if it does then gcam on this phone will go crazy cause of its powerful chip and because infinix now allows bootloader unlock like xiaomi with weeks wait think they want people to make custom roms for it cause they dont update their devices os for long
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,does this phone has sd slot no it doesnt
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,have brought one overall its good affordable gaming phone the only downside think is the camera maybe its my problem but the mp camera is so blurry have already switched to mp mode but when zoom in the picture is even worse than my old poco pro mp if you want phone for gaming and affordable this is good choice if you are aim for the mp camera please choose another brand
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,love this phone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,my opinion is your opinion
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,very basic camera destroys this phones usefulness and in todays phne market more do you think ppl buy this phone for its camera while the phone clearly advertised for gamers bought this phone solely for its gaming performance at least on far with rog phone at fraction for rog price and as far as use the home it lives up to my expectations have my pro max for everything else
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,they remove expandable storage so you will be forced to buy bigger storage phone for more more not entirely wrong in fact but some additionals to mention you can buy money too to get more cloud storage at expense of subscription payment obviously now this hate the most especially when you live in region when the connect is really bad from or to almost none once it hits bad weather or in remote areas for headset well there some excellent yet cheap bluetooth headset but you have to of course find one that suits your and take advantage of promo that might benefits you never bought factory one unless they come as bundles even if theyre subpar as it is
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,nope own dimensity smartphone too compared to comparable snapdragon smartphone of the same more developer still focused on snapdragon chipset than mediatek though some have already started focus on one well sad days to android compared to apple
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the only two reasons why companies have done away with the sd card slot money no more they remove expandable storage so you will be forced to buy bigger storage phone for more as for headphone jack so you will buy their subpar disposable wireless earbuds for more too
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,seems like its far more likely that tecno camon pro is not entering my region bit sad but that means now this infinix gt pro is my top choice as its available right now or wait for xiaomi as thatll have better cam than the gt
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,everything seems fine except for having no ultrawide camera considering they named it pr more they are so confident to use pro for this device but no ultra wide just mp macro and mp potrait wtf
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,you absolutely not read what asked this website admin already fix the phone specs saw more could care less too with micro sd card slots if phones came with gb storage variant mm jack is indeed must on gaming oriented phones like rog and redmagic which still has mm jack
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,owned some dimensity phones phone like xpro is rocking good with dimensity soc my xgt st more nope own dimensity smartphone too compared to comparable snapdragon smartphone of the same brand it does lag not well optimized on some games and apps this might not be dimensity issue as this can be apps issue the safest still choose snapdragon chip smartphone
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,bru for your problem wirelessly quick share is in android if you want super fast wire transf more that brings more inconvenience rather being stuck an sd card slot inside the phone while accessing the files effortlessly than having to find the dongle and connect it right away then you have access to your files at least its better than storing files to somebody elses compute mean cloud storage
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,to some extent mm is compromiseable because you do have good quality dongles in market more bru for your problem wirelessly quick share is in android if you want super fast wire transfer start looking for usb type smartphones with higher capacity storage better spend on ssd instead of micro sd and start using new world features in smartphone accessories dont rely only on old accessoriesinstead of arguing
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,anyone here already got this phone how it performe how is the xos
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,you seem to be still living in the update your knowledge things have changed ya dimensity improved lot nowaday not like last timehot drain battery etc soc ranking top rank is dimensity at this momentgoogle it
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,deleted post mediatek is evolving now bro mediatek dimensity will be in top in the end of
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,deleted post you seem to be still living in the update your knowledge things have changed
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,deleted post not on dimensity and up
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,it would be so freaking funny if the nearly year old iphone xs max blocked this phone from getting to the top of the popular devices list
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,nickson apr well used to have infinix gt pro which also have sd slot and have earphones jack which is more you absolutely not read what asked this website admin already fix the phone specs saw what malaysian arabian nigerian posted on facebook twitterx tiktok apps they all the same even though the accessories is different cause promoted different game ex malaysian with mlbb arabian nigerian with pubg but still no audio jack mm port micro sd card slot which is what feature in gt pro just asked here not even question or compare no the gt pro is not manufactured anymore by infinix it is wise not to buy from third party sellers in my country usually refurnished and not brand new that is why wait for gt pro knowing the cons will be good in advance therefore can start by some splintter for audio and charging people keep defend these companies by removing it yes there is ir blaster and better audio but what is the cost not everyone happy for two features to be removed but the cost will be lower it is midrange phone for budget gaming know but the reason gt pro is highly anticipated because the gt pro stop being manufactured like this one is the same as note pro note pro that one if use the splintter cant use both battery charging and listen to music the sound quality isnt smooth not even support fast charging so have to choose between charge the battery or listen to music wireless bluetooth earphone is not the solution cause have to charging again and again not last forever it cost higher than buy wireless earphone simple and easy just plug and play pubg gaming for hours non stop it is more hassle free but okay fine the arguments needs to stop will buy this phone and gonna wait for new midrange phone that comes with audio jack can careless with micro sd slot but audio jack is must for me
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,mean you did mention dongle for mm audio jack we have one for sd card reader too you kn more yes agree card readers working over usb otg exist and have them again its not solution you can use to record video from your phone when internal memory expires or carry anywhere easily at best you can watch movie then remove the dongle when you need to go however think company once made phone case with microsd slot it used usbc port but provided one more for charging data use cant recall the name that couldve been convenient except it occupied bit of space mm dongle from good qualty brand like jcally or so is so small purty it becomes an extension you can keep fitted to your earphone itself so its almost as convenient as jack although you still cant use usb functions this much compromise is bearable
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,they expect usd phone with usd specifications youll not be surprised to know mm and microsd slot are more common in segment than said not surprised because you yourself know its the truth mdrangers still have these features more right
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,you are right think we are on the same boat will only buy phone with mm jack mic more to some extent mm is compromiseable because you do have good quality dongles in market although theyre disappearing fast and fakes are plenty so an audiophile can make his journey set up even with some problems but microsd no sir no substitute at all convenience of my entire life in one card and shifting it to another phone in minutes freedom from very expensive topmemory models bottom model gbcard is enough freedom from anyone deleting my cloud because microsd is my portable cloud even in national emergency time freedom to watch stuff without depending on network signal data quota more privacy oriented overall although some companies know it all given todays devices fast enough to record video with stereo audio directly to device you cant record directly to cloud or usb memory or anything else if your internal is full huge fast memory but mighty cheap gb high speed card is going for rs just or so even cheaper in other nations reliable if if you get one original from samsung sandisk kingston etc this point is only for intelligent guys of us if youre so bugged by it anyways you have choice to leave it empty yes microsd slot gives you both choices in your hands to keep or not to keep no slot is an imposition to not keep bro ill always let you know reasons if you ask politely but the other superandroid guy saw microsd in when it was launched only in and yet he finds problem with me
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,now use it gaming phone obviously battery drain is faster the heat but that depend how you use feel the price to low for this kind of gaming phone it is cheap between others gaming phone this phone is good very smooth in overall between gt pro my huawei pro my provhave something that gt pro dont have overall everything is good the camera also nice the speaker it so nice loud have bit bass it worth it to try cause it gaming phone its cheap came with finger sleeve for game cooling fan casing glass protector cable charger
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,cant understand why do people in comment section fight over micro sd slot mm more they expect usd phone with usd specifications
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,youd be great in the early probably see the st tv and go no radio no buy more your argument sounds like like square wheels they are modern and fancy because marketing department told us so jack is widespread can be watertight and repairable sd card is relatively cheap provides backup easy to transfer between the phones removable battery prolongs the life of device and makes less ewaste case closed
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,price difference between pro is like euros in my country which one is better deal pocos main show is of course its gpu thats like faster and its faster storage meanwhile infinix has better camera and curved screen think but it still provides more power than need probably even for gaming since mostly game on low for phones any say about how long infinix will provide updates for this phone poco said they will provide years major update on pro hope infinix will atleast give
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,no mm jack no buy
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,at least lenovo pro and galaxy had sd card and they had powerful gpu for emulator not gpu with power of snapdragon from
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,woah chill bro who told you to write goddamned essay on the topic man im scared more you are right think we are on the same boat will only buy phone with mm jack microsd support things that very important for me dont need to tell why need it just need it mm audio jack is must
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,ive said some products need them ive mutliple times said that for photographers and people more woah chill bro who told you to write goddamned essay on the topic man im scared even talking to you anyhow why is it bad to suit my needs are you forgetting im customer if say need microsd in my phone need simple you dont argue youre an another customer youre free to choose product im free too mm jack is helpful so that we dont lug around adaptors to use high quality earheadphones even high impedance ones at least upto if not best earphones of the world are still on mm mm or mm not usb also each earphone having its own dac will increase costs for the end user but its all money waste your use case your more use or anything doesnt deprive me of my consumer rights you used microsd in the how they were launched in that too very low capacities in kbs and all so with this truth exposed am to believe rest of the stuff you made up
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,no storage option lower than mp macro cam no adreno gpu skip average snapdragon fans
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,fun fact apple and intel developed the usb connector in yet for some reason apple we more nay apple was forced to adopt by the eu trade commission to sell in europe if was apple id rather keep the lightning port for global market outside the eu countries if the matter is that they want your money then all companies want your money as well some of them even want to chain your money locked to them only and several of them want your money stays flowing to them even after you die
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,gt pro still better than this too bad they discontinue it fast because it has heating issue along with battery draining problem totally defective device users in india resell their phone after few days of use
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,people who watch video theres no sd card slot put the link here
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,well infinix gt pro dont have sd card slot neither mm audio jack they have removed this features to add gaming processor also ir blaster similar to tecno camon pro they did the same if you recall last series tecno camon pro infinix gt pro had this key features which we need it badly so rare to have this both features well using one of those device works amazing
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,are you blind the mm jack can be seen in the image at the top and next to the jbl logo thats an ir blaster it even has mirror gloss on it you arent sticking anything even needle in
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,wrong this does not have both gsmarena should editupdate spec description infinix more theyre now selling wireless buds so gotta remove those jacks to increase price remove sd card slot
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,mocking others wont help when you suddenly realise that everything from drones dslr more ive said some products need them ive mutliple times said that for photographers and people in those sectors need them and have been saying this for about years atleast think like you say for drones and very niche productsvery spefic product stacks so you have completely proven youre completely ignorant and ignore infomation to suite your needs which is why wrote detailed factual statement about the type port that you clearly seem to be ignoring mobile phones do not need dedicated jack or slot when the usb port is headphone jack and for portable data you can wirelessly use phone to control security cameras and drones now and sony implements wireless tech in their cameras so even they are making these redundant they havent for about years now and should know went from the and of using micro sd and jack port every day of my life to not ever needing them now and promise you use my phone far more intensively than of people on this site from creating music with actual instruments storing all my data doing worksheets and using microsoft office my main driver for entertainment from gaming to video streaming in hdr to high quality music using my usb port as jack for analog signal with my current overhead bt headphones that ive been using since again ignore this infomation right they havent removed an obsolete port or slot that only works with card or aux cable they moved it to the universal port you know the word in usb for efficiency for the end user less things to go wrong less chance of broken multiple ports better body strengthrigidity better internal part placementcooling solutions also yes laptops and desktop pcs have them because they have more room too for one and things like dlsr cameras are generally for enthusiasts who have lot of money have friends who buy mirrorless cams and full sound setups with headphones and dacs and amps with pcs so youre talking to the wrong person about this like you know more you dont also my grandad back in the used to work on computers when you had to literally walk in to room which was the computer to fix things my dad in the was building pcs and doing illegal connections through phonelines to america so again know far more about tech than yourself at this point also another fact used to build and tinker with pcs in the with extreme overclocking and changing timeing values on my gpu and cpu so very much understand what ports pc has thank you even my exs year old son understood more complex infomation than this and he was autistic is it really this hard or is everyone homer im going to go speak to wall have more intelligent conversations keep ignoring the usb port is headphone jack which use as headphone jack get cheaper ssd and save yourself brainpower and money and flexibility with intergrating it with other tech makes life way easier again to reiterate the type port is headphone jack not an opinion its factual infomation
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,well that is shame guess will skip all modern phones without mm and sd card also remo more youd be great in the early probably see the st tv and go no radio no buy or complain about the car and how horses are the better mode of transport
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,no sd slot just dual sim slot bought the phone for my wife well that is shame guess will skip all modern phones without mm and sd card also removable battery
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,what we meant by audio jack is mm port ya the device can take usb headphones been more fun fact apple and intel developed the usb connector in yet for some reason apple were the last to fully adopt it oh yeah because they want your money needing different connectors for their phones and other devices before they finally adopted it with their phones because they were forced too just like being late adopters of their own screen tech ltpo shows you how much apple really cares ive been using wireless overhead headphones for literally years now and the tech has only gotten better im glad youre the device im guessing you meant the phone tbf its something different in the sea of mainstream boredom now dont like the flatness makes screen more susceptible to shattering and more uncomfortable to hold but hey ho but it has some actual flair these companies need the spotlight more
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,good phone killed by big price for an slow charging and useless macro cams
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,upper midrange phone with mm jack sd card slot very very very very very very rare more wrong this does not have both gsmarena should editupdate spec description infinix is now following trends just like the rest
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,false the usb port can do active and passive passthrough and be used as midi controller jus more what we meant by audio jack is mm port ya the device can take usb headphones been using the phone couple of days and its been great so far
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,looks like people have not found out that this device does not have the mm jack from the more no sd slot just dual sim slot bought the phone for my wife
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,micro sd and mm good rare features no headphones jack why
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,intresting phone to look out for
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,proper flagship with microsd card mm jack almost flagship grade processor in euros more yes because youtube reviews and comments here say those two do not exist
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,yup no audio jack false the usb port can do active and passive passthrough and be used as midi controller just like it can read and write data to device like portable ssd or usb dock which can come with card readers people dont quite get this fact
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,wrong infinix has promised two android version upgrades and three years of security more im wrong from commenting that and shouldve fact checked my apologies
Infinix,GT 20 Pro,which is better infinix gt pro or xiaomi poco pro pro

Infinix,GT 20 Pro,the first phone with dimensity ultimate processor price only
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,has anyone else here experienced ghost touch and how can it be fixed only play mobile legends
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,dimensity has higher clock speed than dimensity im kinda confused its the ultimate thats why just like snapdragon series the gen is more powerful than gen
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,august security patch recently rolled out in indonesia hopefully to address fix for critical bug where the device would factory reset when restarting the phoneor at some point the xos crashes then phone proceeds to restart followed up with the factory reset this patch also fixes the issue with game assistant panel going onoff unexpectedly update version spoppfaz
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,hey all just confirming does anyone have major issues with the latest security patch july it is said that the device can go into factory reset but highly doubt it
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,now this phone suddenly has bug where it automatically restarts and resets itself that frp lock screen appears this is happening to indonesian users
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,dear infinix if you are reading this for next zero please add more powerful soc for ga more well provided you can pay double else just dont dream about it or just get from other brand
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,great phone forda price
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,have anyone noticed the rattling sound from camera module when keeping the phone on table or more probably the autofocus since it moves the lens backwards or forwards to focus on objects and this may be moved when you place your device on table or when you tap it possibly making the clicking sound
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,got unlucky with my unit the upper portion of the phone have weird clicking sound when tapp more yess same for me have also noticed the rattling sound when tapping near camera module or keeping the phone on the table as this phone doesnt have ois it rattles loud enough to be heard when tapped near camera
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,how good is the camera of this phone not bad
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,the best flagship phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,lo aug yes also faced the same issue and ive searched everywhere for solutions but couldn more oh that is unfortunate it isnt just me it seems lets just hope the next security patch fixes this issue it is quite distracting whenever youre just playing gamewatching vids
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,anyone having an issue where the smart panelgame assistant panelor probably the game mode it more yes also faced the same issue and ive searched everywhere for solutions but couldnt find any
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,maybe you bought fake one my infinix gt pro does not have ghost touch still use it today bought it in infinix official store
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,will never buy infinix phone again my gt has lots of issue like ghost touch my unit more its good for php phone got working unit no problems at all maybe im just lucky this time heh
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,is anyone else experiencing this when switch between recent apps quickly and im at the very end if swipe up to remove the last app and switch quickly it always bugs out its pretty annoying especially since want smooth experience with this phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,alright this actually very good daily driver and gaming phone just get disappointed at people expecting lot from it its budget phone worth less what are you expecting from it its gaming phone for people on tight budget dont get it why people get disappointed at it for not getting their expectations of it getting fps on genshin or other demanding titles they mightve put it in their advertising about it getting fixed fps in genshin and other titles but you can only expect that in phones with high end qualcomm snapdragon genseries or other high end mediatek dimensity series overheating every high end chipsets overheat too look at the xiaomi poco ultra it gets to temperature of cabove and other budget flagship killers also overheats lot ghost touch has also been huge problem but maybe if you let the phone rest while after gaming for time and let it cool of then care for it think thatll minimise it years of os support thats very common for its price segment no other phones on its price segment has an os support more than yearsexcept the samsung galaxy so dont expect much in xos theyre literally giving up the os for the peak performance so either way its solid phone if youre on tight budget or just dont wanna spend to much on brand new phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,only years software support okay
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,how tf can you keep fm radio cool and remove jack wifi fm
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no not so much ive used this for around month and the battery is not really dissapoi more ghost touches usually happen when the phone is really cold due to the cooler basic physics too cold electric impulses from fingertips dont register to the semiconductor
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,infinix with year os update and year security update you mean gt pro getting os sec patch
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,it will surpass your expectation but the issue is battery is the battery that bad
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,dont okay games on ur phone just buy computer or lap top good one just get pc
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,yes it can go fps it will surpass your expectation but the issue is battery
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,dont know what happened but my gt keeps on restarting can someone help me with thi more dont okay games on ur phone just buy computer or lap top
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,just one week using this and kinda regret why this phone is used to be gaming phone but why it drain battery so fast plus it can go to fps but when you play heavy game performance such as genshin impact or pubg fps doesnt work sometimes not to mention the temperature after min of playing game is so disappointed using cooler only makes ghost touch on the screen lot of complaint about the gt triggers too something its not going well thanks for the price is quite affordable need another saving to replace this phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,enable your esport mode to exceed to fps always reach fps
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,why does gt have problem of screen part not working think it has something to do when the phone is too cold
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,the worst phone for pubg mobile frame drops to fps nad lags it does not run fps smoothly
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,best budget gaming and daily smartphone hope it have good durability are you seeing ghost touches or screen part not working
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,every time play with cooler ive experience some screen parts are not functioning or its ghost touch
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,yeah its good but mine trigger is not working correctly sometimes it touches by it self more nah is ok beside dont use triggers am finger claw player all want is no lag and to fps and at least hours of gaming heating is not an issues cause gaming phones heat thanks
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,gt pro or poco am heavy gamer and pro before you answer like sd chipset have not more yeah its good but mine trigger is not working correctly sometimes it touches by it self its not perfect mean the trigger
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,who needs micro sd if you have already gb not all regions offer gb
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,anyone in africa who got their hands on it egkenyanigeria
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,just want an honest review from uses causes want to buy this phone for playing pubg and ar more yes it can go fps
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,want to buy this phone on exchange of poco gt because used to triggers but only more yes
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,not just infinix but whole transion holding unisoc crying at the corner
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,iam sory that phone note have micro sd so not complete feature phone who needs micro sd if you have already gb
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,already have infinix gt pro is this worthy upgrade from gt pro probably
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,infinix at this point just marry mediatek not just infinix but whole transion holding
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,except switch and pc emulation yes thats exactly what said
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,people say xos is bad in gt pro so he might right wanted to buy gt pro but the more just trade in from gt to gt
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,its like they are rushing to released this model nothing considered major for the device to more bro is your gt pro lagging in games after the os update or have you notice any problem so cause mine strated lagging and am thinking of upgreading
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,bros seething over an os anyway xos has significantly improved unless you use infinix sma more people say xos is bad in gt pro so he might right wanted to buy gt pro but they say after the xos update it started lagging and is full of bugs
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,its good one week of using it and like it so far though my problem with it is the automatic bypass charging which hope they can revert it because using coolerno not the magcharge cooler deactivates the bypass when the device is cool
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,why do these phones exists they have effin poor os own operating system but sucks bros seething over an os anyway xos has significantly improved unless you use infinix smart series
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,just wanna ask if its normal for my gt pro to have like soft spot in the back near the camera part im overthinkingg should like give it check up at some phone experts
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,omg have the same issue the battery drain is super annoying so far the worst have used more for me its pretty decent only single charged for whole day although im heavy user if you want longer battery life limit your least used apps to hz never use hz in this phone personally just hz is enough
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,they say it is hz sampling rate hope it does not give my enemy one step ahead think pro has hz tsp why hz tsp in this one is it update or downgrade
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,how is it outdated the highest end headphones are all wired and more storage space is alw more if need more storage why just not go for gb or tb built in storage poor people cant afford the price maybe
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,just used the phone for week got this phone for around overall priceperformance is one of the best potential performance if its not limited is very stable and easy to cool down using cooler or even fan display quality is good especially the brightness and gg os is not annoying or cringe charging and battery life is consistent well week of used tho lol theres an ultra wide nice wireless charging guess water resistence is not the best charging in theory suppose only need minute but always got minute ish even in my cool room speaker is ok as well as mic video kfps is camera is bad no ois but an ok eis whats bad is that on night time the camera is on par or not that bettee than my itel which is phone new this year zoom digital default zoom not good mean yeah its gaming phone but goddamn the camera quality is just embarassing except for the front and that too only photo not video because the video doesnt even have fps at least pfps
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,but sony and asus keep them its you who are outdated good phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,please reply does this phone allows silent auto call recording without any beep or announcement bought infinix smart from about one month ago when start recording call written message appears stating that according to the law must inform the other party of the call that am recording after press ok to remove this message the call recording begins without any audio signal or announcement to the other party of the call and the recording is completed without their knowledge since the companys policy is always the same across all its models think that this phone may also be subject to this issue
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,surprisingly gt pro offers good video recording kfps tons of ai features and full suite of gaming features triggers button
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,micro sdcard mm jack are outdated piece of technology but sony and asus keep them its you who are outdated
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,they run everything aside from emulation as well as and in some cases even better than snapdra more except switch and pc emulation
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,ive buy this phone some days ago found no problem at all except for kinda fast batte more my opinion most bgmifree fire pro players avoid phones with gaming triggers if you just want gaming phone for casual titles like asphalt or beach buggy flagship soc is unnecessaryeven dimensity or lower is sufficient for example my friend uses nubia neo unisoc triggers and finds it more than capable for cricket football and other light games for serious bgmifree fire performance poco pro dimensity is now the better choice after recent updates fixed throttling battery life and ui stability infinix gt pro dimensity falls short due to poor camera optimization and offers no real advantage over the poco final verdict the poco pro clearly outperforms the infinix gt pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no inti virus android is not windows no need for that
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,apple cant beat dimensity bro even apple can beat sd gen and dimensity
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,you gotta be on some high ass drugs to think th gen ipad can beat the gt pro lmaoo apple cant beat dimensity
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,kindly review its battery timing and drop test
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,gaming phone with mediatek chip thats hysteracial mediatek is for garbage mid to low range more they run everything aside from emulation as well as and in some cases even better than snapdragon chips im speaking from experience here dimensity user
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,well wont say the best phone or what but think we should see it from the price range does other brand have better phone with similar or even lower price than this well other than tecno cause it also member of transsion group
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,super poor battery mah battery is now mandatory feature for android bruh it does have magnatic charge on cooler fan and those chipset consume less power what you complianing about
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,why not fps this phone is beast bro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,deleted post bro you cant deny this phone can beat xiaomi this year
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,deleted post good choice bro gt pro is beast
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,gaming phone without headphone jack what waste yeah yeah you can use dongle or wireless earphones but it still waste unlike their first gen
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,wait what are you talking about lol are you tired of lagging ingame if so this phone is for you you can play any games on this phone insanely good honestly lags kingfinix hail to the king
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,if you have this phone nothing can beat you in game man so fast mediatek are the best honestly wait what are you talking about lol
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,the glazing is crazy average infinix and tecno fan
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no ois no mm they could make it their best selling phone but instead they made it anot more for all that beware ois have not option on this thing they have see the review at jagat first this device have major upgrade at video record sector so please dont judge by the spec idiot western
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,looks flagship to me mean look at the back this is the best flagship no headphone jack more the glazing is crazy
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,this not flagship looks flagship to me mean look at the back this is the best flagship no headphone jack no sdcard gb ram this thing is blazing fast this probably the best smartphone of the year
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,this gotta be my next flagship phone this not flagship
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,its literally euro or wth else you guys want
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,way too outdated no thanks atleast it can beat the gt pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,youll rather buy ipad pro th gen than this way too outdated no thanks
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,can we turn off the wireless charging when using cooler fan yee we can theres an onoff button for that
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,ois is not that important youll rather buy ipad pro th gen than this
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,im user of infinix gtpro and for my suggestions for all china phone they should take note ab more honor does years oppo does oneplus does only xiaomi who are properly lagging behind with as main chinese brand in western markets so excluding ones where youre having to really import the phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,ik its cheap gaming phone but rather use weaker phone for better software update more there isnt an industry standard for updates
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no slot micro sd no jack audio
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,dark flare support rgb backlights blade white single white backlightingx shadow ash single light blue backlighting dont wrong chosen set is small tips
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no dontbuy one next yearif you want one then buy poco pro infinix was an attractive choice but wouldnt be surprised if we see poco next year lol
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,just get if still being sold somewhere or second hand thats really weak advice considering how oneplus nord ce is available for inr with snapdragon gen and about higher performing nord ce will be launched around and both have microsd card slots as for my present phone have lg gx it has microsd slot the best audiophone of all times in the market title that shouldve gone to an iphone but hey times change
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,can it play codm on fps yes at max settings use the included gaming magcooler and magcase if you are playing for an extended duration to even better deal with the thermals and get more consistent frames
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,yesits relay suckpro have is probably because it wasnt meant to be camera oriented phone the gt pro is somehow based off note vip series if note vip was thing
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,getting this for my family member if it has microsd slot otherwise skip therere more just get if still being sold somewhere or second hand
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,lmao the design and specs remind me of gaming phones from goated love this phone lol
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,is this worth it over poco pro play with charger on so was asking if the bypass cha more well to choose the infinix for their bypass charging is only better if you tend to use the device for more than hours of constant usage it does not strain the battery and goes straight for to the hardware its like using plug in laptop when you want full power when gaming but if you are pause in between after game or low battery its better to use the poco for its fast charging both in terms of performance are great for heavy gaming but if you are in rush to charge while gaming then infinix is good choice despite the small performance difference but if you pause to go and charge then come back then poco is better and in terms of other things like camera and hardware go poco if you want extra features like the gaming trigger and other things then the gt pro will do
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,guess there will be no gb then whats next gb for gt pro there is gb version here in indonesia priced at rp and the rp for the extra bit that includes the mag case and cooler it can be bought seperately for rp in here tho we have to buy them in their official store if there is stock same method they used when selling the gt pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,it even has no ois yesits relay suckpro have is
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,such stale and cheap looking design compared to last years device it even has no ois
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,here in indonesia they put on rp for can say its only alter more guess there will be no gb then whats next gb for gt pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,specs look convincing with some additional features that some phones dont have but is it good for longevity like about years oh and im choosing between this and poco pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,eh poco also only receive two android os upgrade with three years security updates at most wh more umm not anymore after and pro all newer ones get major updates with years security
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no oiseis if want ois eis can choose note pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,for long term use poco is better infinix only get two major os update cooling system and pe more eh poco also only receive two android os upgrade with three years security updates at most which is exactly the same with infinix gt and note line of phones including the gt pro unless you are purchasing google pixel or some higher end line of phones then you are most certainly never going to get more than two android os upgrade from the manufacturer throughout the phone entire lifetime
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,at least give fast charging infinix phone almost give fast charging only its very sl more have adapter on infinix it takes less than min mins it may even take less than min the watts dont always guarantee fast charging speed but the technology behind it
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,because google deemed running an external expandable storage to run your apps on android to be more ever heard microsd express its pretty fast the external storage technology is still developing even the new nintento switch using it if it can be use for running games on switch there no problem running apps on phone the reason phone manufacturers are abandoned external storage is because cloud services they want customer to subscribed to their cloud for more money and there is the last flagship still has external storage its the new sony xperia vii and expect sony to keep it for foreseeable future because the japanese people still like external storage
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no oiseis
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,even some other gaming phones has already ois asus rog or the red magic from nubia or at lea more redmagic and blackshark are considered as flagship phone dont try to compare its functionality when the phone are much cheaper than thosed brand out there this is just midrange gaming phone gamer doesnt really care about photography they care about the performance wise even redmagic didnt have ois until and poco phone are just copycat of redmi phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,still its pretty good deal for cheap gaming phone you got charger out of the box free magnetic case free cooling fan not to mention it has gaming trigger on the side of the phone and cool looking backlit like nothing phone aesthetic could live without ois as long the camera could capture good quality in low light environment is more priority so no issue for me since im not videographer and only use the phone as daily driver if you need stabilization just buy gimbal stick for better balance separately if you really need it duh you buy smartphone for its performance design wise functionality reliability and the durability of the phone buy only what you really need my opinion just look for the phone that has better reliability and durability for long term use some of these guy just like messing and trolling around lol
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,im disappointed too still have the gt pro and it does have micro sd expansion more because google deemed running an external expandable storage to run your apps on android to be much slower and unsecure compared to internal storage all google pixel line of devices which are considered the reference de facto standard for all android smartphones in recent years have no expandable card slot of any kind and other manufacturers have followed suit anyway the era of expandable storage in all higher midrange and high end smartphones are long gone this is especially reinforced by the fact that the internal storage that come in phones are getting significantly larger and more affordable with every passing generation and that everyone wants more and more sophisticated features packed into their phone without sacrificing current improvements to things like the size weight battery display camera etc over an expandable memory slot
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,deleted post im disappointed too still have the gt pro and it does have micro sd expansion im thinking infinix decided to ditch it permanently so im sure all future gt pros wont have it either ill just stick with my gt until they stop supporting it
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,bro hopes this phone has good camera bro forgot the price of this phone is far below the flagship gaming phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,is this phone compatible with arcore
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,its gaming phone not photography phone even some other gaming phones has already ois asus rog or the red magic from nubia or at least eis which dont have either even the old black shark had eis at least heck even the previous gt pro has ois
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,does the main camera have ois sadly no ois in gt pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,only for wired disappointing at least give fast charging infinix phone almost give fast charging only its very slow hours half finish
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,great it has fm radio
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,this phone or poco pro poco pro is better
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,look at pocos phone and you will think differently yeah and think gt pro better
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,its normal that the infinix gt pro doesnt have ois because its gaming phone if you want ios just buy infinix note pro or phone that has ios as simple as that
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,compare the price not the phone
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,are you buying ios or buy performance im not getting either with this phone its midrange phone with questionable build quality
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,still poco pro better the price is cheap rm usd
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,deleted post there is gb do you see
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,you sure about that eis probably its ois but only on the main camera on the rear the main rear camera is mp ois
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,ois is pretty common to every phones nowadays so its disappointing of this phone having no ois tbh you sure about that eis probably
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,poco xpro better if youre looking for version
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no ois what joke are you buying ios or buy performance
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,but the value youre getting is good dont you think look at pocos phone and you will think differently
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,poco is way better poco phone is prone to motherboard issues better to choose gt pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,dude its gaming phone just buy the infinix note pro if you want it ois is pretty common to every phones nowadays so its disappointing of this phone having no ois tbh
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,not ois camera how to buy worst than infinix gt pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,no ois no telephoto lens where you put telephoto lens again after zero pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,perfect phone for us dollars want black and red one love wireless charger
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,price may be high but the value youre getting is good dont you think
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,gang should buy ts or just save up for poco pro save up for this its betterrrrrrr than poco pro but not better than poco pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,display mah battery watt charger if only this had been included it would have been number one gaming phone love infinix gt series
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,pretty good choice for gaming the downside may be overheating issue because of no limitation like poco
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,is more cheap than note pro plus
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,guys im sorry but have to type this we got infinix using snapdragon before gta
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,hmmm lets see
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,the rival poco pro
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,if its not that much more than the then it would be very interesting gaming phone if it comes with microsd slot the screen resolution is very high hope it comes with resolution choice mode enabled
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,watt but why thought it would be watt
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,im gonna be the first guy post the comment wanna say infinix is getting better
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,please add detailed specifications about the cooler material and size
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,good midrange gaming
Infinix,GT 30 Pro,why design is changed
Infinix,GT 30,hope flagships use ips lcd just like the one on my huawei lite which could re heal com more keep dreaming boy your lite just mid range
Infinix,GT 30,so you buy absolutely no want to get one of the infinix gt and mush
Infinix,GT 30,iqoo zx will probably be better money for value
Infinix,GT 30,same the worst ips lcd display is still miles better than the best oled display mark these more hope flagships use ips lcd just like the one on my huawei lite which could re heal completely on its own in weeks time caused by an accidental alcohol spray and the burn in was gone and hope the ips lcd on honor is the same if it really do then it is good news as it has reached screen to body ratio meaning lesser sell ing prices these words came from one of the wisest person the most mysterious un recorded by human kind
Infinix,GT 30,nope no in all ways love good lcds in high ppi same the worst ips lcd display is still miles better than the best oled display mark these words of wisdom
Infinix,GT 30,considering the price and comparing it with nubia neo gt this is actually not bad at all and it makes nubia neo gt look horrible but welp people are gonna complain anyway because that is what you guys do the best lol
Infinix,GT 30,dimensity doesnt have any powerful core like core or or oryon core gb ra more so you buy absolutely no
Infinix,GT 30,in india gb rom version is also available but not more than gb in any version dimensity doesnt have any powerful core like core or or oryon core gb ram enough for it
Infinix,GT 30,oled is good though better than lcd nope no in all ways love good lcds in high ppi
Infinix,GT 30,this is literally budget gaming phone tho well at least the chipset are better than nubia neo gt
Infinix,GT 30,totally agreed is pretty much budget phone almost entry level why would anybody make more this is literally budget gaming phone tho
Infinix,GT 30,gb is ridiculous no sd card and no audio jack is ridiculous and nobody likes oled anyways

Infinix,Hot 10T,basically changed from hot to this device because needed speed in delivering my whatsapp messages im into real estates and whatsapp is my main app market my product with imagine sending post to about whatsapp groups and it takes over hrs for the messages to deliver to each of the whatsapp groups and some will end up not delivering anytime post propertiescolleagues who are interested in any of them cannot even reach me on whatsap because their messages will not deliver until all the messages sent delivers and at the end of the day they wont have any option but to call me and have to add them on another whatsapp line to attend to their questions and feedback pls note my internet connection is ok and use mtn line seriously regret buying this phone
Infinix,Hot 10T,the mh is scam jare it doesnt last as expected my hot that has mh last long more it does last the perceived reduction in battery life believe is accounted for by other features it have which your other hot dont have such as hz refresh rate it take power to deliver such seamless operation alternatively you can elongate your phone life by reducing that to hz in your settings have the phone and think for its range its awesome

Infinix,Hot 11 2022,wish there was system update from androidinto android and please infinix community enhance the performance of my mobile phone because am experiencing lag and overheating on my mobile phone in games like pubg mobile is delaying my gyro in this game hope you notice it thank
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,still holds up for me am able to play mlbb and arena of valor without any hitches media playing is good not for heavy usage and its expected for the price range camera feels like lol
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,actually had the infinix hot for long its good for gaming example games like minecraft an more your phone is not working for the
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,draining battery even if your not using it
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,its not good keep playing games and it suddenly disconnected every time play and it is sometimes laggy
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,is it okay to update this
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,infinix hot is not really recommended have been using it only for weeks not even mon more available
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,is this information valid from other sources read that this phone has nfc which one is true
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,if youre planning to buy this phone avoid this dont buy this this is just dow more actually had the infinix hot for long its good for gaming example games like minecraft and codm its smooth and dont lag but when saw this phone sold my hot and bought this its lot better than the old one and this is an upgrade its good as infinix hot
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,its doesnt have stereo speakers only bottom speakers produce sound which is loud enough if use dts sound
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,good phone for the price it has great display performance is also good enough just use third party launcher or disableuninstall bloatware apps since ads would definitely lag it and annoys alot can run games smoothly but havent tried other then ml at high graphics but there is kind of abit touch delay sometimes only for people who want cheap phone with good looks can go for it but if want bit more performance go with hot but for me hot design aint my type so yea everyone has choice note it has gyro sensor when check it think almost every necessary sensor magnetic proximity light ambient etc
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,what are the difference the older one has bigger battery and better cameras and way better chipset for the same price
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,wouldnt be bad value but sadly its not better or cheaper than the older hot or more what are the difference
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,ive also read that infinix is putting malware on their phones didnt more malware more like bloatware lmaooo
Infinix,Hot 11 2022,theres no gyroscope how to play games without it

Infinix,Hot 11 Play,hwyy im infinix user and my brother just gave this phone to me and its was charging to slow after years
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,quality phone
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,used this phone for years and the performance is disappointing though the life span is pretty great and it can last while but for general use its great but it just falls off the expectations youll meet in gaming phone though the camera is pretty commendable but if you want gaming phone this is not very great choice
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,but the phone is fast and good for online gaming like free fire and cod right hot play user but had really bad experience about this phone its vibration is not working of sharing photos on whatsapp once click youll have to wait for after that youll be able to send camera is not so good and exactly battery is also worst in shot total waste of money
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,this phone isnt good for playing online games or whatever sht it is camera is so bad everything
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,bro this cellphone is bad only play free fire but it immediately heats up and makes lag when playing moreover when playing mobile legends its almost as hot as radioactive nuke
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,it cant run wzm mobile so if you wanna play wzm mobile dont buy this phone btw its still good the camera is just kidna trash and blurry
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,never got any ad jn my phone and yes disabled the palm store app the app sometimes get en more but the phone is fast and good for online gaming like free fire and cod right

Infinix,Hot 11 Play,use this phone since its only have one speaker but the speaker not on bottom but it on top that make me feel uncomfortoble and its very lag if play game likes roblox or others
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,honestly this infinix hot play does not support usb otg have opened every corner on its more pls how about the speaker
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,the only downside for me is just the palmstore wont stop sending ads notification remove the permission for notification but weeks later the notification turned on its own somehow tried to deactivate the palmstore app but even the ads notification still popping up and then another weeks later the app getting activated by itsown somehow its just annoying to see the unswipeable notification
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,performance is the in rate somebody say it is lagging but bruh its only in peso dont expect high graphics for your daily gamesthis phone is not made for hard gamesbut you can play hardgame like in low graphicsit so smooth and the camera is slightly ok all natural colorand this phone is overall perfect for its price in but now you have more choices in infinix better than that
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,the specs match the price of this phone so you guys are really funny for complaining serious more hot play is very smart phone with good hold up of battery but the price support to low
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,it is so bad mobileso many times hangs and so bad experience use with is it normally hangs but not all the time
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,the speaker of infinix hot play phone is huge disappointment to say the least
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,not recommended lie about otg and use about an hours and its very hot charge very slow the lied about otg it is not working just wasted my money buying this scrab
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,the speaker condition very cheap very low volume capacity speaker are very very bad rd class phone

Infinix,Hot 11 Play,buy this phone model last year and good to say it still working till now all the specs more it charges fast
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,try to buy original charger its actually nice phone great for gaming and online class etc the problem is ive been using several chargers and always bought new one just for it to charge and after it wouldnt work again its either slow charging or not gonna charge at all dont know if it had problem on its charging pin or im just using non orig charger
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,speaker is too low very heavy this phone is only good for gaming nothing else

Infinix,Hot 11 Play,whose camera is better the infinix hot play or hot hot camera is better
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,keeps on disconnecting from wifi connection and games lag too much really not recommendable really my games dont lag at all the phones run game smoothly try switching on optimization for any game you download in game zone it really helps ive been playing free fire and they have been no lags at all
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,dont really know the difference between hot and hot play whose camera is better the infinix hot play or hot
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,agree the sound decreases with time main issue yes about the sound without headphones can hardly hear people talking to me on the other side
Infinix,Hot 11 Play,for the most part it handles your everyday uses pretty well the battery life is above average speakers arent special but the position doesnt cover up when holding it during games it doesnt love up to the gaming expectation though light to moderate and never heaavy or the lags are going to annoy you the bloatwares are horrible and the built in cleaners and boosters do more harm than good the constant app notifications pester you too out of stars at best

Infinix,Hot 11,cameras on the back in this phone its only the rd hole just ai logo
Infinix,Hot 11,with the specs it should be marketed as social media phone rather than gaming phone because it has better screen resolution
Infinix,Hot 11,its disappointing to see hot is better than hot hot has mp camera and hot has mp another problem both same has processor but hot resolution was lower so it was handling games pretty well wonder how in hot wiil handel resolution

Infinix,Hot 11s,infinix hots only have gyro software so it will be delayed infinix note series start fro more how to fix gyroscope delay in games like pubg and codm
Infinix,Hot 11s,just wanna say infinix put nfc in this phone they have nfc version
Infinix,Hot 11s,was looking for replacement on my samsung galaxy and this phone looks good on my bud more own galaxy as well and considering my options for new phone have stumbled upon infinix hots due to the same reason budget landed upon this option because wanted better camera better display and better storage in this price plus also wanted sturdy battery and screen protection wanted to ask if bought this phone and how was your experience in comparison should go with it

Infinix,Hot 11s,pls clarify does it have dualmono speakers or stereo speakers dont buy this cheapest phone dont waste your money and time its all features are bad hate infinix phone buy it yesterday but had waste my money
Infinix,Hot 11s,why infinix hot didnt have fast changing because its an entry level phone and thats common
Infinix,Hot 11s,you want to buy iphune pro max in this price range why infinix hot didnt have fast changing
Infinix,Hot 11s,cheap technology not powerful at all price around tops plastic you want to buy iphune pro max in this price range
Infinix,Hot 11s,please can anyone tell me the actual price of this phone cause see different prices online and dont know the actual price
Infinix,Hot 11s,the battery isnt true mah its like mah something my vivo last longer more dean you should turn of the hz mode to as it takes more energy from the battery
Infinix,Hot 11s,lol nice fake rd camera
Infinix,Hot 11s,actually own one and think it is bargain for its performance the hz ultra wide screen is big plus definitely one of the best budget phones out there the only down side is the shell it is solid but its completely made out of plastic still love this phone though
Infinix,Hot 11s,cant download on play store how can fix this try to reset the phone or clear play store app data
Infinix,Hot 11s,according to their website they are using dinorex glass protection why does gsmarena little more actually they mentioned it on their spec sheets dont know if they updated it now maybe they have overlooked it but is their now
Infinix,Hot 11s,how long can this phone from to years
Infinix,Hot 11s,can someone confirm if this phone has gyroscope and how good it is because some face proble more infinix hots only have gyro software so it will be delayed infinix note series start from have gyro hardware
Infinix,Hot 11s,good question display to body ration is great kinda feels premium
Infinix,Hot 11s,good question you want single camera camera bump at others dont
Infinix,Hot 11s,why no specs in gsmarena for infinix hot nfc global ver its different design and be more not to be confused with infinix hot for indonesian markets
Infinix,Hot 11s,instead go for zero neo ultimate in this category
Infinix,Hot 11s,why infinix always give others useless camera even triple camera but only camera is use more good question
Infinix,Hot 11s,review pros great display nits decently sharp hz really makes difference more tf hz display on budget phone is impossible on this year bruh
Infinix,Hot 11s,overall liked the phone very much except in call noise multimedia experience on this phone is best compared to all others tried all brands one more thing infinix should note is dont make phones bigger than anything big then that and hands pain even in this device hand pain is there but kept the device purely for multimedia display camera sound class
Infinix,Hot 11s,slight upgrade from hots but like display watts fast charging thats all
Infinix,Hot 11s,isnt the storage on it available only in gb and has gb ram option or does it depend on the market and is this the best phone in this budget if the main propose is display and storage
Infinix,Hot 11s,internal memory must be not only
Infinix,Hot 11s,specs are same as redmi but cost less so good pricing
Infinix,Hot 11s,is this mistake it is written fps instead of the video rec officially advertised is
Infinix,Hot 11s,specs are pretty comparable to the redmi but bit worse no ultrawide and only gb of ram
Infinix,Hot 11s,outdated and low cpu emmc storage think infinix thinka hz is the only important thing in mobile phones and rest can be lowgrade
Infinix,Hot 12 Play NFC,it iz good and how much

Infinix,Hot 12i,its the launcher installed from store tui just in case stick with the more yepp thats nice and you noticed the device is getting stable think last weektoday being we go an update which improved the system performance and display touch bug buh the device still freeze sometimes in apps do fix that by navigating io recent section and back into the app nav gesture mode
Infinix,Hot 12i,its the launcher installed from store tui just in case stick with the default launcher and no one got to go through what had thank you thats what missed to mention in the last comment btw
Infinix,Hot 12i,thanks for sharing your experience with us real want to buy this phonebut almost got dis more this is the worst device have encountered so far have repaired this device infinix hoti not less than times this time around am planning to repair it and resale as can not take it anymore
Infinix,Hot 12i,can this brand be upgraded from present tog when fully in operations looking forwards to hear from the management so soonthanks
Infinix,Hot 12i,extremely disappointed there is no otg support otherwise works great for social media light more the only problems personal observed from the brandare the expandable rams the internal memory should equally be expandable furthermore kudos to infinix but they should also try further to improve on there product
Infinix,Hot 12i,another important update was released few days ago fixing some issues and optimizing the device but there are still some problems that need to be fixed problems like the recent apps not showing when in split screen mode of the right half also still wonder how weak this helio processor is if you notice the device forces itself to run when just switched on it hangslags and sometimes some stuffs crash but the device becomes fully ready after some seconds close to minute ill suggest that since instead of we the users to press buttons and stuffs while the device system is starting the developers can add feature whereby nothing can be pressed on the screen while everything is on startup until the process is complete it will help us to understand the device is waking and dont want to keep on trying to run my apps when the phones not loaded out of patience things crash xd im also quite disappointed when realized it was quad core device bought formerly used an octa core device with helio chipset and its much faster with no lag at all gionee lite buh anyway this device is recent mini version of infinix hot flagship device so its understandable we can expect more updates to balance and stabilize its performance its quad core ghz phone buh feel the bugs are making one or two cores work only lol the device performance needs to be boosted lot and know the developers will figure that out with time sorry for bad english
Infinix,Hot 12i,no usb otgthis is there is no otg support for this phone yea its so disappointing
Infinix,Hot 12i,yep was making my life much more difficult after noticing your comment realized its more
Infinix,Hot 12i,didnt notice any bug like that but updating your system should solve that problem yep was making my life much more difficult after noticing your comment realized its just my device that having this issue and immediately tried to reset the app preferences and the landscape recent app force portrait thing disappear working just fine for now im not quite sure what did messed up and by the way by the time im answering this ive already updated my system weeks ago to the latest xos thank you tho id probably just continued to blaming infinix if its not for your answer
Infinix,Hot 12i,do you have bug in the recent app when you rotate your phone in landscape orientation it more didnt notice any bug like that but updating your system should solve that problem
Infinix,Hot 12i,not good in mobile games you need to press hard to function the screen in online games the camera ai is also not good as realme camera
Infinix,Hot 12i,it has been as of yet the best phone yet loving the space and havent stopped downloading and my movies have never been great loving the screen and picture quality
Infinix,Hot 12i,bad phone no magnetic
Infinix,Hot 12i,mine is working perfectly no issue at all
Infinix,Hot 12i,the infinix hot is not strong but it is fast in social media mine just shut down
Infinix,Hot 12i,darn recent app feature forces its orientation in portrait so you couldnt see any recent app that opened in landscape
Infinix,Hot 12i,bad phone ever many problems facing in this phone like display touch
Infinix,Hot 12i,very bad in terms of touchtap sensitivity not good for gaming social media on the other is okay but for gamers seeking bit cheaper smart phone definitely not recommending this unit
Infinix,Hot 12i,please put screen guard if want to scroll down it will not work until press it well update update update update your phone in setting worked for me
Infinix,Hot 12i,really bad lol just had this phone for weeks and not single time it got wet fell on the ground and only been using messenger facebook and youtube on it and its not booting up anymore
Infinix,Hot 12i,this is and this phone still using micro usb port and only quad core processor big no for this phone
Infinix,Hot 12i,what its just quadcore helio no thank
Infinix,Hot 12i,nonsense phone no compassion sensor it will work little and start displaying rubbish
Infinix,Hot 12i,seriously stay away from helio it only has cpu at ghz and cortex architicuren plus that gpu better get than this if you are gamer
Infinix,Hot 12i,pls the phone is it good to go worst phone dont buy
Infinix,Hot 12i,the upper screen is giving me problem if gives problem at upper screen it cease
Infinix,Hot 12i,any one face touch issue in this phone upper notification in not working properly and sometim more the upper screen is giving me problem
Infinix,Hot 12i,quad core micro usb
Infinix,Hot 12i,well where did it came from ask ur friend
Infinix,Hot 12i,processer scrap quad core
Infinix,Hot 12i,hmmm wonder where the camera design came from coughcoughonepluscough well where did it came from
Infinix,Hot 12i,processer scrap
Infinix,Hot 12i,completely overpriced when will hot be out
Infinix,Hot 12i,looks like premium lower range phone with great specs this great specs in your dreams bro helio cant even handle android properly if android update came out for this phone itll make it worse
Infinix,Hot 12i,strong battery
Infinix,Hot 12i,helio android why
Infinix,Hot 12i,such cool looking back design unfortunatelly with the realme narzo prime being eur less and is better in every possible way this just doesnt make sense
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,very laggy agressive app killing music stops while playing games app or game crashes when popup shows up keyboard doesnt show up game often crashes cant multitask game crashes when you are using floating window pls fix this
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,king of bloatwares
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,it has problem with the brightness random change level brigtness mode adaptive brightn more problem with the brightness auto brightness even when the light is low when the light is low it become bright even the adaptive mode is off
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,agree same problem bro this is the worst phone that ive ever had
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,redmi is better than this and redmi price bit cheaper sure the redmi note minus is only no stereo speakers and not support fast charging up to watt
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,dont buy this phone such waste of money super laggy its overheating ill make you stress
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,user note dec this is competitor of poco pro same spec yeah but poco still bit better in many sectors
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,gb of ram but it has extended ram so its fine antutu goods extended ram is just useless marketing gimmick trust me
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,mrecchiwkun oct the specs are ugly overheating issues what are you talking about specs are great for low to mid range phones yeah except that minus gb ram for the last six months felt no overheating issue for example it can run pubg in smooth ultra nonstop for to hours with barely any feel of heat on my hands
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,the specs are ugly overheating issues
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,storage type emmc or ufs emmc
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,it always force closed when playing light game since the latest system update games always force closed such as clash soccer manager total football but when playing mobile legends it wont happen so weird
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,hello ive been having issues with the phones signal and internet my data keeps more my phones issue is also the data it keeps on disconnecting at first thought it was because of my simcard or the signal but the problem is really the phone
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,did anyone knows if this devices got android update not yet own this phone and no updates seem svsilable not sure if there is an image for it tho
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,find this model ok for the price paid for it the lack of ram makes it lag in some occasions and the virtual ram does not help too much
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,advantages infinix hot model is worth for money in my own experience in the past three day iam using this mobile its good and nice product in this cost of budget is too good battery charging time to its take hours time disadvantages iam only disappointed in this lcd display and water drop noich
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,bay display not good light gb ram only battery sitting abaout ig online blabla like for ever
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,so many holl in this phone but no screen protection no ip no fast charge no gyro sensor and no ultrawide sensor
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,infinix hot is using mediatek dimensity and the chipset is only support ufs storage type the price of hot is and think its not worth because doesnt has gyro sensor and gaming experience will not good in shooting game like pubg mobile and the camera sector and fast charge is too simple
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,this device is great is anyone using this in the usa by any chance what carrier are you using
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,am really disappointed with this phone dont have any other application aside from some social media and couple for banking apps but the phone is so slow hoping that can still get my refund or at least replacement
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,it definitely could use some more ram dependant on how well phone manages the ram had oneplus with only gb of ram and it was really good at multitasking
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,im happy with it so far could do with bit more ram but is ok for those who have issues with being unresponsive disable useless apps
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,does the stronger chipset compensate for the lack of ram nope phone will become unresponsive if you intall more apps am using the phone and it sucks
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,this is competitor of poco pro same spec
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,really good phone but ram must upgrade itkeep it up infinix what fantastic smart phone of the highest order for the simple price
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,smooth screen and fast network speed had to disable some notifications and apps though
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,definitely pretty cool smartphone with abilities courtesy of the dimensity like the camera setup and the smooth display as well
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,the big and smooth display and the mp camera are highlights in this mediatek powered smartphone
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,the network is good but the gb ram is smaller compared to the device
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,the ram its not okay for such device it will soon run out of users because of this ram attlis its has to ram
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,liked the phone but that ram betrayed me
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,not to hate infinix or anything but gb ram is already deal breaker for me the price tho its steal
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,dimensity seems uses ufs or ram is one of things to be compensated dimensity it self at least required gb of ram and since it only provides gb cpu clocks was throttling down to about lower than it should be
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,anyone knows what this device memory use
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,first hot series phone great chipset hzbut low ramgb is minimum
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,that water drop notch is too ugly for phone at this price
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,infinix hot infinix common
Infinix,Hot 20 5G,why not megapixel front camera cuz its too much for eur phone
Infinix,Hot 20 Play,just dont this is my main for almost years and its lagging like hel save your money for other better phone
Infinix,Hot 20 Play,does it work for high def in mobile games no
Infinix,Hot 20 Play,yeah idk why even bought this thing want to buy it but it is not in my area who sells it should comment
Infinix,Hot 20 Play,hot is better than and play yeah idk why even bought this thing
Infinix,Hot 20 Play,do not buy this thing small water damage bricks the entire thing and the chipset is so bad just playing codm will crash it the camera is mediocre and the video quality sucks overall would not recommend just buy the other infinix hot or smart models or if you want other phones from different manufacturers overall this thing sucks even for work stuff
Infinix,Hot 20 Play,mine has not displayed and most of peoples they told me it can be either mirror or circuit how can fix this problem because heard the spare is not available can you assist me it is infinix hot

Infinix,Hot 20 Play,calebility mar after comparing both and play it depends on what you want if you want phone that wo more absolutely right bro also considered both these device and bought redmi two months ago

Infinix,Hot 20S,after about months of usage the vibrator stopped working never dropped my phone now more for me the charger stopped working months in and months in the chipset just gets worse and worse
Infinix,Hot 20S,meanwhile my galaxy sii from do better well you should consider to rethink what you more have here lg and hot easily compared hot has much more detailed camera softer color overall they are comparable would not brush off this phones camera that easily

Infinix,Hot 20S,pls which is better hot or poco pro
Infinix,Hot 20S,should get the hot or hot please help huhu hots is way better than hot you should watch some vids about that in yt
Infinix,Hot 20S,the device is excellent for its price compared to its performance but its defect is that it has problems in the software and until now this is still the case from since bought it in the second month of
Infinix,Hot 20S,im thinking of buying for my graduation its cheap for that specs its pretty nice
Infinix,Hot 20S,hope they are upgrading this
Infinix,Hot 20S,hi guys ive had phone for over months and everything is great but here is the issue with the infinix hots first the screen will just randomly stop for like sec and you cant touch it its very terrible for gaming when you cant move for seconds the phone also heats up so much it will make your hand literally sweat and have more worst touch on the phone imagine playing with sweaty hands and hot phone next is the phone randomly shuts down mine just literally randomly shuts down the otherday and then tried restarting by pushing the power button and spamming the vol button and it worked right now im currently typing with my loptop because my infinixhots is broken and on black screen mins ago it works so fine and good but when opened it it wont open and stays still on black screen until now cant open it and im getting it checked tommorow on whats the issue infinix if you cant fix this sofware or whatever bug it is on the phone might just not use infinix my whole life
Infinix,Hot 20S,hi did you use the hz to get the screen time with battery level and how much hours more the screen is automatic it switch mhz according to content and used app but you can still force it to use hz the charging take maybe hours use my battery from to to avoid battery deterioration battery life is good
Infinix,Hot 20S,why would you compare year old flagship phone to budget midranger that comparison don more you dont make sense
Infinix,Hot 20S,been month using this device as my daily driver everything run really smooth the screen very adaptive outdoor and indoor the battery last day for time charged multitasking run so smooth no gaming and surprisingly in place where live the signal capture really strong worth price to value
Infinix,Hot 20S,watts max works well in charger though this phone can receive charging
Infinix,Hot 20S,is it normal for the phone to heat up to when playing outside game like pubg in hz an more yes this phone heat up easily always play with cooler
Infinix,Hot 20S,does this one has gyroscope gyro software not so responsive
Infinix,Hot 20S,the rumors about the battery runs out very quickly it is because many users including me are activating the hz screen refresh rate volume and the screen brightness is also determining factor if you guys do many things in this phone with only hz screen refresh rate balance brightness and volume the battery is as long lasting as the other mah phone comment this not because im tryna promote this product but actually use this phone as daily driver
Infinix,Hot 20S,its so good phone but think it will be the best and cheapest phone if this phone have more watts max works well in charger though
Infinix,Hot 20S,its really amazing phone with its really compatible features and outstanding performance
Infinix,Hot 20S,pretty good phone for the price gigs of ram and gb of storage good gaming performance hz screen and good charging all for fingerprint sensor is ok some software bugs that fix with restart decent camera

Infinix,Hot 20S,got disappointed my screen recording on every game at my first use it has fps smooth but when tried to update my infinix hot to the latest my screen record always got fps and no options to maximize it still waiting to have an update and fix this issue but over all its so good for the price gaming experience was smooth as heaven not much heat it depends how you use it thank you hope this complain will got to the forum of infinix hot

Infinix,Hot 30,this thing people never talked about you cant use your phone while there is multiwin more if you have the gb variant then obviously itll lag if you have the gb it shouldnt cuz mine doesnt it only lags if have game like minecraft open in multiwindow also dont turn off ai memfusion its on for reason and helps it run smoother
Infinix,Hot 30,it gives me fps in mcpe and it gives me like fps in usual it overheats in free fire with mid graphics and cant run free fire in mid graphics exept if hav gb ram memfusion
Infinix,Hot 30,using this phone rn helio aint that bad but it overheats easily it can overheat you knowsuppose you bought this mobile for gaming but you bought the variantin thisyou can play games like gamesyiu can play games such as free fire but it will heat quicklythe reason is games need much ram but if your doesnt have much ram then your mobile will give the pressure to your cpu ehich is supposed to go to ramso recommend to buy at least variant for games to work smoothly and for no heating
Infinix,Hot 30,mth using this phone my opinion here pros long lasting battery smooth bcs has big ram fast charging taking up min for big storage my country gb strong signal on lte coverage strong siganl in wife coverage cons camera quite difficult to focus especially when want to scan qr when wanna upload something from file its taking time to appear the file needed gallery app too simple thats all at moment

Infinix,Hot 30,please how about data consumption
Infinix,Hot 30,thats more of location issue and not an issue with the phone supar phone is mai fevret phone
Infinix,Hot 30,since when have you been using it one of my phone is samsung actually doesnt has many sensors like and but has good camera and and photos are better than phones with same price my battery phone is good but for gaming its slowly down maybe the problem with helio if you looking for phone that has good camera and good battery life just buy samsung with snapdragon chipsit and just remember samsung and samsung but samsung series is better
Infinix,Hot 30,what do expect from infinix since when have you been using it
Infinix,Hot 30,it already launched and in both ghana and nigeria got one already very good one am thinking of buying it also but want to know how good the battery camera is
Infinix,Hot 30,what budget phone can recommend with good camera quality phone has camera with good quality samsung and but is cheaper both has quad camera this is not about number of camera but both has good sensor for foto video and support like ois and gyroeis actually all samsung phones is good but series is more better than or series
Infinix,Hot 30,not perfect but this phone is good in her class but dont expect much with camera what budget phone can recommend with good camera quality
Infinix,Hot 30,thus compared to vivo ys which is better hot more better in charging and good in gaming then ys is has ipx dust ip water resisten and more better in multitasking more better in bettery life because it using nm chipset and both mast be use ufs storage and camera sector is simple between them to me vivo is good choice too me vivo ys is better but overall about ys its not worth because too expensive with should watch another brands before buying phone like lava blaze motorolla and samsung the three of this phone are more powerfull and more cheap than vivo ys
Infinix,Hot 30,tecno pova pro is better than this phone thus compared to vivo ys which is better
Infinix,Hot 30,is the camera really better than iphone pro max hot is the worst phone ever too fat camera is not clear laggs lot
Infinix,Hot 30,yeah the differences being the more premium back made of glass and mp selfie camera on sp more ill go for stereo and
Infinix,Hot 30,tecno and infinix are subsidiaries of the same company so the designs of these mobiles are so more thatd be transsioon holdings
Infinix,Hot 30,infinix and tecno keep on repeating this same phone infinix hot and tecno spark pro are more tecno and infinix are subsidiaries of the same company so the designs of these mobiles are so similar tecno and infinixs parent company is called transaction holdings chinese company founded in
Infinix,Hot 30,same nonsense with spark pro lol
Infinix,Hot 30,this is just repetition of tecno spark pro would have put in to make bit difference nice phone though the issue still remains lack of android upgrades
Infinix,Hot 30,both infinix and tecno are starting to be more like what xiaomi was in the past before the got more processer us less powerful also nm is outdated we need nm wich is more efficient on battery
Infinix,Hot 30,when it does have cheap phone like this is still use helio with an emmc storage enough for budget users if gb storage will be an ufs storage
Infinix,Hot 30,yup infinix and tecno starting to get better only problem is their lack of android support more both infinix and tecno are starting to be more like what xiaomi was in the past before the got famous for having affordable and excellent phones overall even their entrylevel phones announcedreleased this year offers much more than the majority of brands while keeping the accessories other brands insists to remove accessories with the environmental excuse maintaining the same final price but still releases real electronic garbagephones with or gb ram or gb of internal storage just hope that tecno and infinix doesnt fall down into the endless spiral of releasing phones per year like xiaomi
Infinix,Hot 30,tecno spark in disguise no be lieee
Infinix,Hot 30,looks good
Infinix,Hot 30,common this is great bugdet phone man with quite decent camera and an octacore processor with decent storage and price ill recommend this rather than the iphone se or iphone

Infinix,Hot 30i,typing on this phone right now nice cameras for cheap entrylevel phone great storage and pretty decent performance for its price but the software needs to be bit more polished ignore my last comment accidentally pressed the submit button
Infinix,Hot 30i,nice cameras fkr
Infinix,Hot 30i,the data file folder cannot access because the update same as my old phone
Infinix,Hot 30i,guysthere is nothing wrong with this phone but gotta say the battery has been bad after more most of the complainers about their fast battery drainage might be using phones while charging your charging is going to become slow at the same time leading to hotness of the phone youd discover that after year your battery life is nothing to write home about
Infinix,Hot 30i,the only thing dont like about this phone is that when its battery reaches below it really drains fast
Infinix,Hot 30i,bruhh this phone is so many problem
Infinix,Hot 30i,so infinix techno and itel are from the same manufacturing company called transsion so infinix more thats not what he asked tho
Infinix,Hot 30i,this phone overheats soo much even in very basic use with an wifi hotspot enabled the name infinix hot pro is hot alright just like the name
Infinix,Hot 30i,im using tecno spark which is the same as hoti network is showing lte why and wh more so infinix techno and itel are from the same manufacturing company called transsion so infinix is the top brand then techno the midrange and itel the budget one so as you go down the line you get reduced specs with the same processor same operating system and everything
Infinix,Hot 30i,it happens to me toodid know how to fix it
Infinix,Hot 30i,android to isnt big advantage just making the performance more potato wouldv more have been observing your commentsis the mediatek helio that badwill it perform bad in the hands of people who do not game
Infinix,Hot 30i,lte means enabled im using tecno spark which is the same as hoti network is showing lte why and whats the difference between lte and
Infinix,Hot 30i,most disappointing thing is no stereo speakers and when earphones are fitted sound only comes through one ear
Infinix,Hot 30i,have used infinix for months its been doing great job but experience crushing when used tiktok and the battery quickly dies dont suggest using this phone it has poor camera and the only good thing about this is its cheap
Infinix,Hot 30i,really hate infinix hot because if im playing anything wifi keeps disconnecting
Infinix,Hot 30i,most of the information you submitted are wrong camera mg processor helio not un more you seem like the type to think the world revolves around you every region has varying specifications
Infinix,Hot 30i,does the version have nfc pls answer no
Infinix,Hot 30i,what is bluetooth version of hot
Infinix,Hot 30i,does hoti support pip mode while playing video and where can find this
Infinix,Hot 30i,does hoti have split screen mode
Infinix,Hot 30i,the xd got hold of units config to review and bought separately over several mont more does the version have nfc pls answer
Infinix,Hot 30i,yesterday after updated my phone then plugged my charger the time plug my charger in it charges but right after turn it off to let it charge it suddenly disconnects ive been using my phone since early june last year tt
Infinix,Hot 30i,apparently when you make call you can not access the quick settings in the status bar when you do the screen shuts off as proximity sensor is placed in not so ideal place it detects the finger accessing the top area of phone
Infinix,Hot 30i,my battery bar wont show up after everything that ive done help me
Infinix,Hot 30i,infinix is very bad you can buy other phone people can buy whatever they want bro buy it before you give star review
Infinix,Hot 30i,which us better itel or infinix hot
Infinix,Hot 30i,good day really want to purchase infinix phones but the height of the phones are too high any height above inches is too much please try and reduce the height of the infinix phones because its my favorite phone infinix models thanks

Infinix,Hot 30i,may know is it come with nfc features the xd got hold of units config to review and bought separately over several months has nfc tested them myself by reading my beep card while the xc the first one bought with config back in may this year doesnt have nfc
Infinix,Hot 30i,yep people got confuseactually this phone infinix hoti has two type phone using different more may know is it come with nfc features
Infinix,Hot 30i,for real they used unisoc
Infinix,Hot 30i,if your country sells the variant better off with itel if available you wont more for real cuz am trying to get one this week
Infinix,Hot 30i,is that real unisoc isnt it use helio in some countries they sell either garbage wc you should avoid while in some they got the better wc is recommended always check the boxmodel check specs before buying
Infinix,Hot 30i,for starters in my country its very cheap and good choice not to say it is around dollars someone told me few days ago and it is pretty much great always keep the brightness at since dont wanna feel my hands getting burned when im playing or talking with people also used ds emulator and it went very decent even more great than thought did not downloaded this cll of dty mobile since really dont wanna spend huge amount of space have the gb one
Infinix,Hot 30i,lucky for malaysians our market uses unisoc which is wayyyyy better than helio with unisoc the antutu score is which very good for the price of rm but for helio variant its just what shame ufs storage type wasted
Infinix,Hot 30i,in philippines they sell the unisoc variant good phone for its price use it as pos more is it hood for real life usage
Infinix,Hot 30i,on my hot when enabled to show taps as developer not up to hrs the shows tap settings will be disabled this is my main concern about this phone how can fix this issue
Infinix,Hot 30i,that must be the play version and unisoc is way better than helio few country sells the variant in indonesia hot has helio even the play
Infinix,Hot 30i,it wont be your favourite mobile if it lags that must be the play version and unisoc is way better than helio
Infinix,Hot 30i,mine is not showing network onlylte am seeing pls lte means enabled
Infinix,Hot 30i,the phone good like it but hope it is not expensive bought mine on promo while real price then was
Infinix,Hot 30i,hope it doesnt lag
Infinix,Hot 30i,in indonesia this has helio which is basically with hz the phone good like it but hope it is not expensive
Infinix,Hot 30i,they advertise unisoc as octa core gaming engine im laughing so hard
Infinix,Hot 30i,do the phone come with some infinix app like yopart xclub etc yesit does
Infinix,Hot 30i,and also dont ever turn on power boost its not good for the phone it degrades the more do the phone come with some infinix app like yopart xclub etc
Infinix,Hot 30i,using the phone from months but only the problem wifi issues and many bugs like cant more the phone is good with good designer
Infinix,Hot 30i,still avoid extended ram at any cost it can degrade performance in worst cases severe cras more and also dont ever turn on power boost its not good for the phone it degrades the battery life
Infinix,Hot 30i,he probably bought the hot not hot has helio and better specs overall
Infinix,Hot 30i,yeayea it also has megapixel camera and helio instead of unisoc and mp cam inf more yeah some countries come with either or soc so better check the model or spec on the box before buying or if you want over then either get tecno spark citel instead both are the same transsion company owned anyway
Infinix,Hot 30i,my friend has it and live in indonesian the chipset is not it has gigs of ram more yeayea it also has megapixel camera and helio instead of unisoc and mp cam infinix hot is specifications is different in some countries
Infinix,Hot 30i,maybe because it was manufactured in different country my hot has chipset in it the infinix hot in india or in some countries it has helio gmn instead of unisoc it also has megapixel camera
Infinix,Hot 30i,latest mobile update join us for more detail
Infinix,Hot 30i,oh wow that sucks after researching seems like only supports emmc storage its only more android to isnt big advantage just making the performance more potato wouldve avoided hot because they sell helio variant in indonesia not
Infinix,Hot 30i,helio variant has emmc oh wow that sucks after researching seems like only supports emmc storage its only advantage is having android while the unisoc is only android
Infinix,Hot 30i,phone comes with ufs not emmc but eitherway avoid extended ram if phone has atleast gb or mor more helio variant has emmc
Infinix,Hot 30i,this model comes with ram extended still avoid extended ram at any cost it can degrade performance in worst cases severe crash and hang due to emmc bottleneck
Infinix,Hot 30i,then hot is must avoid helio is basically revamped garbage helio what is the more that true
Infinix,Hot 30i,in indonesia infinix hot gbgb has helio chipset httpslifestylekontanco more then hot is must avoid helio is basically revamped garbage helio what is the point of having gb ram with weak processor
Infinix,Hot 30i,the cameras are fake was using tecno pop plus but its cameras are good compared to infinix hot and its too expensive for nothing
Infinix,Hot 30i,am sure unisoc is better then helio even their gpu are different use mal more problem is the variant have android while only android which is supposedly better than it
Infinix,Hot 30i,infinix infinix hot is the bad phone ever use eiiiii the battery is not good at all it cant even last for half day
Infinix,Hot 30i,think its because you bought fake the camera is total trash at this time where all phone are going heads with camera quality you are giving us the wako this phone is total waste of money except for the fact that the body build is awesome everything about the hypes phone is no for me
Infinix,Hot 30i,but thought the phone is gb ram because if you check the ram is actually you have to modify and restart the phone my suggestion is that you search it online
Infinix,Hot 30i,mine its video and photo quality display is very poor what can do
Infinix,Hot 30i,mine its internet speed is too low and its segregating some lines what can
Infinix,Hot 30i,as someone who owns an old phone oppo version this smartphone is huge for me because theres so many features in this smartphone that dont have in my old phone besides this has good specs and this can play super high games like roblox without no lag and genshin impact and love this smartphone forever btw this infinix hot is in philipines
Infinix,Hot 30i,believe me this will be total loss of your money if you buy this phone please dont buy this phone
Infinix,Hot 30i,brazilian version has been released with gb ram gb storage helio chipset mp main more bought this phone and im not happy with it at all the phone doesnt go dim or dark when youre making call what is the problem
Infinix,Hot 30i,why is infinix hot is didnt support android
Infinix,Hot 30i,two points to admin please have second look at the ram there may be more than one variant to the buyers be aware that all infinix phones offer only one gps position while other phones feature or more positions for better accuracy buy only if you get good price bargain
Infinix,Hot 30i,whats real discription for internal ufs is not emmc maybe is real the ufsthe device sosogood low price
Infinix,Hot 30i,great phone it has no xos lab updates and no android
Infinix,Hot 30i,is this device for gaming im not sure but my call of duty app keep closing automatically then after reopening it restarts even after clearing data and redownload game resources it still crash after uninstalling the game and reinstalled from playstore the game worked fine for days then start crashing after download some game resources dont know for other users though wont recommend this phone for gaming
Infinix,Hot 30i,no its not dont even try might end up messing up with the device is this device for gaming
Infinix,Hot 30i,can this phone play aethersx playstation emulator with total zero lag lol no stronger phones have lag
Infinix,Hot 30i,there seems to be two versions for nfc and non nfc the nfc model xd that is not nfc mode xc
Infinix,Hot 30i,would like to know if this cell phone is better than the infinix hot or what other baratk cell phone do you recommend
Infinix,Hot 30i,the fast charging that use to show when charging has disappear after the recent update pls why
Infinix,Hot 30i,the phone deleted an important video that need to submit renamed it to keep track and did more if havent deleted the video boss just add this at back mkv or add mp it will show video back
Infinix,Hot 30i,is the second camera functional yes it uses it in portrait photos to add depth
Infinix,Hot 30i,why was the volume of hot reduced after the recent update the volume reduced after the update can someone assist
Infinix,Hot 30i,this is so true equally bought this phone out of duress when my infinix hot got broken more changing to then to and back to angin its if network doesnt good sistem will change the network to just lock your network
Infinix,Hot 30i,this phone has two version st unisoc with ufs storage type that has ability read mbps and write mbps nd mediatek helio with emmc storage type read mbps and write mbps both is good for multitasking but unisoc is better than bit powerfull for gaming but its not recommend for heavy game just light game like free fire and mobile legend
Infinix,Hot 30i,the performance is more than enough for daily usage decluding the genshin playstore version more thanks for the reply thought the ram was expandable to gb or is it just their marketing strategy well think the unisoc processor is way better than the processor tecno spark has so
Infinix,Hot 30i,gaming perfomance you can play mobile legend and free fire with well but just high graphic more can it play efootball updated one
Infinix,Hot 30i,really like iti saw some comments complaining about making it to gb but im still ok with the its really nice
Infinix,Hot 30i,its nice but make the ram atleast or because gb and gb big difference but yes it has gb
Infinix,Hot 30i,hows this for gaming call of duty mobile genshin impact pubg wild rift etc the performance is more than enough for daily usage decluding the genshin playstore version but it would obviously overheat fast if you put your games setting to high if this ever get gb variant this might be an all rounder imho in my house opinion
Infinix,Hot 30i,is star rail playable my dude gotta buy this phone for an upgrade with little budget planning to buy this too for star rail
Infinix,Hot 30i,wat kind of phone do think have the best camera an enough space with fast internet loading infinix note vip

Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,yes it is getting the android now in may or june and it is already at android actually more is it truly get android cus im considering buying the phone but need something closer to the lastest android version
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,so no update roadmap for hot series will it get latest android or just note series only yes it is getting the android now in may or june and it is already at android actually and im not sure but think it is going to get the android as well

Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,bought this for used back in july and gotta say im kinda loving it decent specs for the price and it even has stereo speakers which is pretty crazy the front camera died month in but was able to use my warranty so no big deal however this seems like common problem with this model they also included the charger which is big plus the software is okayish there are some bloat but its not as bad as xiaomi or oppo and you can actually uninstalldisable them overall its pretty good phone for the price
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,is hotpro better than vivo vpro no as infinix hot pro user vivo pro is still unbeatable why would you compare budget phone with high end phone

Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,im sick and tired of this phone cant even aim with this sith es to unstable frame fudging phone
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,infinix dont update their os phone since infinix note which is android one phone so th more def not the best option buy it because its labelled as note is the worst thing possible you should keep an eye on the device tech specs and make sure theres no regression in single place like removal of gyroscope removal of mm jack or worst gpu
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,brought phone serial number hx manufacturer infinix model infinix unfortunately this restore automatically after each two hours how can solve this problem
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,hope they add an system support to the xos because they released this in just months and more infinix dont update their os phone since infinix note which is android one phone so the best option is to buy the infinix note if you want to be on android

Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,sorry for the long comment just bought this phone in may th since cant find the infinix note anywhere near phone retailers even on tiktok shop ended up bought this one for instead although it does not have recording but in terms of chipset performance and battery life it sure does beat my old vivo the only cons is the ultra steady mode it goes pretty dark indoor it really is picky on lighting otherwise camera wise is good there are led flash on the front which is beneficial for whose to take selfies at night can be used on video calls depends on chatting app used can enjoy using this for maybe another to years just need them to fix this camera related issue gaming wise pretty good for cheap device worth the upgrade
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,does google maps work well on this phone im thinking of buying this phone but had th more its really good on this phone it locks with satellites outdoors whereas my previous phones barely tracked at max

Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,infinix note is better with the same chipset and faster charging not when it comes im camera both rear and front
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,redmi note is far better than this infinix hot pro bro are you serious they are actually leveled out hot pro is really ahead when it comes to process with helio which is like better than redmi note gets the display hot pro is cheaper and they are pretty leveled dont forget the mp main camera on hot pro which has zoom
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,its funny how infinix note pro from about or years ago is so much better than this its too laggy wayy too laggy for the specs and dont even play any mobile games on my phone
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,does the camera produce good quality videos that can be used for youtube also how is the more would say the photos and videos is pretty decent to say the least the screen is somewhat sharp due to the full hd screen resolution its not dull definitely
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,im super disappointed with the phone saved up to buy my dream cell phone this happene more take it to carlcare office maybe they can help from your experience how is the quality of videos on social media
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,the issue have with the phone is the quality of display lack of depth in the front camera and too much noise in images captured in low light phone icons and other graphics look sharp but videos on social media look too dull and almost unbearable to my eye coming from the hot pro display my phone since this was way too unusable for me
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,memory storage in sd card capacity
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,its usually dependent on the processorlike how much pixels does it support more sadly gsmarena does not have review for note pro so couldnt compare them
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,please if you use this phone need your honest review how good is the battery between more the infinix hot pro has battery lifespan of hours straight gaming
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,what does means the and the pro which is more better is the rate at which the charger will charge your phone in most cases chargers have rating of ww respectively and so in simple terms the higher the number of walltzw in the charger the faster your phone will charge think you understand now
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,infinix hot pro battery is very weak other is ok dont think you understand what mah and means
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,not pro is batter please is the camera of note pro better than this
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,omo can this phone play warzone yes but framerate and performance isnt the best need more powerful chipset
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,bought this phoneall can say is this phone is worth buyingbelow you got good ca more does the camera produce good quality videos that can be used for youtube also how is the screen display is it sharp or dull
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,for the price is okay tho

Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,redmi redmi note redmi note infinix hot infinix hot pro tecno spark pro more buy redmi guyz you wont regret it the gb versionmoreso any phone with helio is banga camera picture quality is super good and processing efficiency as well is class helio can stand toe to toe with plus you saved lot of money choosing processor phones
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,id like to add to this ineffect this phone ufs rating on the storage is which is more thanks
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,please avoid ram expansion as it will reduce performance and puts extra work into the storage chip id like to add to this ineffect this phone ufs rating on the storage is which is really the minimum rating to double your ram if you have the gb version storage can but do note the performance lag you will definitely feel it for gb version then definitely do not turn on the ram double as it will eat more of your storage as well as the drop in performance
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,how to make upto ram please avoid ram expansion as it will reduce performance and puts extra work into the storage chip
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,does still good enough in they are still capable until the fully phased out
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,im stock between cherry aqua shelio pro and infinix hot pro helio any more if you find hot pro cheaper than aqua pro recommend you to grab this phone
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,the configuration of this mobile phone can only be sold in economically underdeveloped areas but no one will buy it in more developed asian countries because the configuration is too low
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,im tired of these so called stereo speakers sounding so messy anything more hot pro sorry for the mistake
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,feb which model of tecno spark pro
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,infinix should have just stick with the infinix hot pro design tecno nailed the copy and more your point is well taken it does seem like infinix and tecno have taken inspiration from the iphone pro max when designing their infinix hot pro and tecno phones respectively on one hand its testament to the popularity of the iphones design aesthetic that other manufacturers are emulating it it shows that consumers appreciate clean lines symmetry and minimalist design on the other hand it can be bit unoriginal and even misleading for consumers who might mistake the infinix or tecno phones for an iphone in the end its matter of personal preference and what consumers value in smartphone design some people might appreciate the familiar design cues while others might prefer something more unique and distinct either way the fact that infinix and tecno have successfully replicated the iphones design shows that they are paying attention to trends and consumer preferences in the smartphone market
Infinix,Hot 40 Pro,im using rn its cool and good

Infinix,Hot 40,oh the battery is ass got this phone exactly one year ago and can proudly say since more chinese people who make stupid phones and call them infinix hot that are all very stupidim typing from one nowand even my keyboard is laggingtoo forever before the keyboard showed up imaginei bought the phone and saw video of some chinese guy while they were packaging the phonegb rami swearmy first phone infinix hot gb ram isnt this slow

Infinix,Hot 40,in minutes that should be you bought the hot instead read again
Infinix,Hot 40,just got it recently and the battery is discharging at about per hour using chrome more yes
Infinix,Hot 40,its been year now since bought this phone specifically th of december and so far its good when it comes to gaming though recommend just going in medium graphics because it cant take high and ive been able to play properly atleast but for everything else like social media its also good it doesnt lag much even hz although it will lag sometimes if you multitask when gaming and using social media at the same time but still can play behind all that is it worth it yes atleast for me because bought this with big discount during christmas sale through their official online store and desperately need new phone around that time and my old gb samsung core isnt doing me any justice in gaming let alone social media and also because this was the cheapest yet most optimized budget phone that ive found as student with no job so in the end id say this was worth the spending also ps im the andrew who commented before that was before had an account
Infinix,Hot 40,infinix hot worst phone ever bought when mobile storage is full it starts hanging what can you do to make the phone stop hanging

Infinix,Hot 40,it looks like they gave huge chin to the iphone camera bump dont understanded the vision is too low for this phone why not or this phone hot is my test
Infinix,Hot 40i,you lier infinix is the best have been using it for over years now and have the best exper more you have been using it years that dont know ow another phone is like
Infinix,Hot 40i,the same issue when am using infinix hot to play game if minimize and go back to the more same here
Infinix,Hot 40i,nonsense phone ever please dont make the mistake that made the battery is good true
Infinix,Hot 40i,exactly especially the light filter on snapchat its annoying it cant be clean dynasty
Infinix,Hot 40i,really bad in snapchat camera after making the video in snapchat and save they chnged the colour exactly especially the light filter on snapchat its annoying it cant be clean
Infinix,Hot 40i,yes im using hoti and it has nfc support nice apps for android phone infinix hot
Infinix,Hot 40i,is it true that this phone cannot be detected when you plug it in computers have experience more enable developer mode and from the system developer options enable the file transfer mode under usb thethering this is second option the phone actually enabled automatically if correct adb drivers installed into the computer
Infinix,Hot 40i,the same exact issue am facing with my hot any time minize an app drawer to get inform more the same issue when am using infinix hot to play game if minimize and go back to the game the phone will automatically close the app no matter what am doing eve
Infinix,Hot 40i,want unlock the boot loader how can do it
Infinix,Hot 40i,not good enough after months of used the volume of speaker is getting low mode ive used this phone for months didnt get any problem of the speaker being low modemaybe you should try changing the dts sound in the settings
Infinix,Hot 40i,its been months ive used this phone and in my opinion this phone is perfect for daily usage and for gaming but not like heavy graphic games but it can run on games like codmfree fire with no lag and its amazing in my opinion but theres stuff that dont like about this phone and its about the camerathe front cam feels like ive taken picture with microwavelow quality but the back camera are the top tier use pro mode for my picture and came out beautifuland video with pfps is just fine for me tbhthe battery last longer than britney spears marriage like mah is just perfect and display with hz refresh rate is perfect slide smoother than my brainthis is probably one of the best budget phone that can get for doing daily usage
Infinix,Hot 40i,was concerned the reason as to why infinix hot series cannot be advanced to have camera of mpand also advance to connectivity of
Infinix,Hot 40i,cant find font style in this phone how can get it you cant
Infinix,Hot 40i,bro this thing has the weakest game processor ive seen guys the hot is way better th more thats why it has its like the lite version
Infinix,Hot 40i,there are many shortcomings to the infinix hot device such as the pixel screen which can only be hd poor camera quality and poor software updates compared to its competitor xiaomi
Infinix,Hot 40i,yeah its slow but its quite fair for its price infinix hot
Infinix,Hot 40i,overall the infinix hot comes with lot of issues right from the manufacturing company more right when minimise app go do something else and come back it takes my back to the beginning
Infinix,Hot 40i,thats what ive been saying thank you some people here dont know anything more yeah they just stuck in the pass
Infinix,Hot 40i,believe it pixel bin so the output is mp thats what ive been saying thank you some people here dont know anything about pixel binning and claim everything is scam
Infinix,Hot 40i,someonei bought units for my kids as their graduation gift and its about months still in good condition havent seen any issue that is why decided to buy one for me but ill get the infinixpro this time also want the newest release which is infinixo but compare to pro the camera and charger are better than infinix
Infinix,Hot 40i,my flashlight is not working when scrolled from up to down why there is any solution
Infinix,Hot 40i,does your infinix hot heating up upto degrees celsius when it is being charged coz more have been hsing this for long time and yes it heats up easily like it doesnt have cooling feature
Infinix,Hot 40i,really dont really think its lie he either is trying to send fake news or doesnt take proper care of his battery
Infinix,Hot 40i,what see here is people want exceptional abilities on budget phone and that isnt pos more dude its called getting what you paid for but this guys are not giving us what we paid for the advertised phone specs dont match the actual phone specs and thats just another form of scam most people who dont have money for flagship phone are very careful when picking budget phones and make sure to check the specs before purchase so its not fair to see something on the internet and then when receiving the ordered phone get something else
Infinix,Hot 40i,use the warranty or reset the phone or go to nearby phone repair or their physical store that more rest
Infinix,Hot 40i,new mobile infinix hot only day usemany times overall touch not workingthen press on more use the warranty or reset the phone or go to nearby phone repair or their physical store that will help also update you phone to its latest version
Infinix,Hot 40i,unisoc is slow af yeah its slow but its quite fair for its price
Infinix,Hot 40i,the infinix hot its good for people who use the device for light games only like pubg and cod etc and for people on budget like me sorry im filipino so money is very valuable for me buy this brand new for dont know how much this on us dollar the design is good its like infinix smart but more design you will like design of it its look good also about the performance well it have unisoc know know its not fast but its better to have this than infinix smart because it have android and its not go edition so you find usefull feature on this phone unisoc is not strong not fast but decent for casual light gamers and games the display is xp yeah its display so its battery friendy not stunning not bad not good its fair decent so dont expect much more the camera is mp and the front is mp which is impressive for its price but the color is quite bright like when you go outside and capture thing you will see on image its wuite bright than the natural light the slowmo can capture clearly and smooth video nice thumbs up for that for that overall design fair camera for me display not stunning not good not bad its fair battery im gonna tell you why processor you know why features will tell you why problem well battery yeah it have mah in side the phone but found the battery is quite little fast draining also infinix smart have mah too but when you test both of the phone its will have different result when you test it to without background processing also the features yes it have android and not go edition but some of the features is not complete like where the phone gesture yah it have gesture but for music only music hope this help you dont forget that this phone is slow so suggest you buy pro version of this model but for low budget people like me this is for you also it have watts charger and it have fast charge features crazy
Infinix,Hot 40i,just have question for those people who have this phone if you dont have this phone more dont buy this phone repeat dont buy the phone has several issues my older phone is way better than this nonsense

Infinix,Hot 50 4G,infinix hot hd screen gb ram gb doesnt have nfc seems more like downgrade more have eyes or not
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,bro why did you buy it late hot literally just got launched lmao infinix hot hd screen gb ram gb doesnt have nfc seems more like downgrade than upgrade
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,did you get the gb ram have the gb ram variant and its flawless the ads can easil more actually got the gb variant too and honestly ram usage is still mess right from the start over half the memory is already in use dont get me wrong the phone can run fine for basic stuff but xos itself is the real problem if you dig into developer options youll see how bloated the system is tons of unnecessary background services constantly running some even duplicated for no reason many of them cant be properly disabled without adb or root its like only really get gb usable ram the rest is chewed up by the system no matter what do ive already disabled what can turned off suggestions restricted background activity all that it helps lot but it doesnt fix the root issue xos is just poorly optimized and filled with junk if they cleaned that up the hardware would actually shine
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,bought the infinix hot based on specs but completely disappointed by the software xos more did you get the gb ram have the gb ram variant and its flawless the ads can easily be disabled and the bloatware can be ignored and some of them can be deleted and disabled battery and ram management is good for me
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,does the hot phone support wifi because the wifi at my house is yes
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,best budget phone that got for helio display mm headphone jack ded more almost every phn still have mm lets talk about downside st display is pretty dull feels like it lacks density under direct sunlight it gets too reflective dont know if the screen protector is the reason also its bit too greasy might get annyoing for color anything red will become more red captured pictures lack brightness you will see more saturarated pictures because of the display might see focus issues speker could have been better you always stay above on ghz wifi speed goes upto mbps also not stable online game will suffer but with ghz it peaks at no connection issue ui is butter smooth battery is good enough if you menually optimize apps so in short this phone has thats it need only performance just go for it need everything look for other phones
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,from where you get it shopee the phone came from china and was shipped to the philippines
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,pls when did you buy it and pls use it for gaming and tell us how is the performance and batte more bought it last week the only game that ive tried so far is mobile legends all the graphics settings are set to ultra no fps drops or major overheating it only drained of my battery after game session

Infinix,Hot 50 4G,youre wrong there are only and for the version in malaysia is the more the price wrote is for the redmi not the infinix hot
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,the ghz wifi is ac so the answer is yes yes but sometimes ghz at home also run slow have infinix hot plan to buy infinix hot or wait for hot series
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,says who sd gen antutu is around and sits at how is that slower not gen thats gen do you understand about chipset
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,sds gen is lot slower than says who sd gen antutu is around and sits at how is that slower
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,its downgrade slower charge camera downgrade no stereo same old chip probably just more sds gen is lot slower than
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,compared this phone camera to galaxy redmi note and galaxy note and it was significantly better than all of them especially in low light
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,alwayson display with ips some people cant buy expensive phones and dreaming with simple features like this one in my opinion companies like infinix honor and samelike are giving the availability for poor people to enjoy also side by side with people who can buy top end phones
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,dunno why this phone doesnt have more good comments just bought it and it more is this phone dual speakers
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,the video can shoot kfps
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,you use your phone for what social media browsing and youtube in that case most modern ch more so helio is high end for you is midrange and is low end wonder whos dense
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,helio is same as and same as hots also have ufs storage used the phone fo more you use your phone for what social media browsing and youtube in that case most modern chips will feel the same to you lol but ive tested lowrange and midrange chips with gaming and theyre clearly not the same even the antutu scores show difference before assuming get your facts straight first so you wont look stupid my guy there are sites like nanoreview even if youre dense just look at the numbersthey show nightandday difference
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,im not fan of infinix but thats gotta be the dumbest thing ive ever heard so better more helio is same as and same as hots also have ufs storage used the phone for years ago
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,this is infinix hot renamed and has helio in place of helio im not fan of infinix but thats gotta be the dumbest thing ive ever heard so better chip faster storageufs is same to you
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,the speakers are bad it is too quite
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,hot pro is better than this cos of

Infinix,Hot 50 4G,can speculate that maybe you think upgrade is has to be something major qolquality of life more this phone is overpriced im just telling that would not reccomend upgrading to it
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,the camera is awful aswell can speculate that maybe you think upgrade is has to be something major qolquality of life featurecourse not have ever you guys take everything for granted regardless
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,no ones use their phone bro probably not true theres tablet kid beside can you consid more the camera is awful aswell
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,helio charger for mah lcd hz dont reccomend buying allat sob no ones use their phone bro probably not true theres tablet kid beside can you consider that maybe its good thing this phone has upgrade toward its camera not like youd need fast charge if you ever stranded to foreign property cause people are good sheeps
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,it feels like there are some drops in specs from the previous series the current series only increases the chipset and thats only slight improvement
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,camera setup looks like candycrush sugar crush
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,my last fair price is usd double that at least
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,yes sir you read it right waaaaw
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,ufs yes sir you read it right
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,ufs
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,at least this one has bypass charging compare to hot
Infinix,Hot 50 4G,not sure about everyone else but like the idea of putting htz on an lcd display
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,have owned this phone for about months the camera is not great but overall the phone has performed very well especially at the price point would recommend it
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,im thinking about buying this model so if some good soul would like to share their impressions of this phone are there any major problems after using it for long time thank you
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,should buy this phone or an itel rs buy
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,are stereo speakers bad on this phone
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,does this really have an major os update
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,they will die before giving up the garbage processor the previous gen is better than this one shameful
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,has anyone noticed screen flickering on the infinix hot pro sometimes the brightness seems to go up and down on its own
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,currently using hot pro but the successor is bit disappointing no gyroscope the pro had gyroscope for eis even if it was only limited to the stock camera app
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,just bought this everything is great display sound build are amazing it do the job just need andorid to use the jack and chatting
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,suggest me the good charger for this phone is this phone it up while charging normal my phone more normal phone operating temperatures are typically between degrees celsius when discharging the temperature can range from degrees celsius especially in pakistans climate since your phone has an amoled display you can enable the extra dim option and set it to full or half intensity in your settings youll notice this not only saves battery but also helps reduce phone heat
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,spamton apr would suggest using the charger that came with the phone and select low temp on more yes at low tem option also increase battery timing qnd life
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,anyone know if theres going to be android update the inifinx facebook page in comments say that there will be update for hot pro
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,from where we get in ethiopia addis ababa
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,just bought this for php usd from online thanks to discounts and its worth for the more the reason this phone might have better quality pictures than the pova is because this phone has ai enchancing with its ai cam making pictures look alot more bright and colorful than they actually are
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,what are your remarks about the display quality and do the phone lag while operating lastly more also forgot to mention the internet connection this specific phone doesnt support anything besides and below there is hot pro believe though but not sure with the same specs except with support but it costs more wouldnt know how much more
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,spamton mar have been using it for few months yes and it being worth to purchase depends entirely on more what are your remarks about the display quality and do the phone lag while operating lastly what about network reception does the phone supports
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,btn this infinix hot pro and the infinix note pro which do think is better overall havent used infinix note pro however from the specifications id say the note pro is better due to its mp camera and most likely has fps for recording like the hot pro however im not sure about that for gaming its also better than the hot pro however the hot pro has helio and note pro has helio but the difference is honestly too small that you most likely will never notice it when gaming overall id say the note pro is better but the prices will definitely be different as the note has cooling system while the hot pro doesnt which is sad but from specifications alone id say note pro is better however youll find hot pro phones for around to dollars while the note pro will most likely be around to dollars or more but thats just my guess as the phone is strong as an all in one
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,so is the phone worth buying have you been using it tell me more have been using it for few months yes and it being worth to purchase depends entirely on what purpose you want to use it for for an every day phone id say its worth the money for picture taking its not the best but it does have an ai cam option in the camera menu which allows pictures to be taken in better contrast and makes the images more clear than without the ai cam which in my opinion makes the camera worth the price it is sold at the camera has mp and can take pictures at full screen and ratios the video camera is able to take videos in fps fps fps and fps fps while video recording can be useful but im sure there are better phones out there that dedicate themselves to just their cameras however they most likely will be more expensive if gaming is what you want to do id say for the price its definitely worth for gaming atleast if youre on budget however for some reason cod warzone is missing from the playstore but cod mobile works fine genshin and most other games ive tried work fine with only genshin having the least fps on high resolution but rest of settings are set to low getting fps the phone might not be the very best but you have to keep in mind the price and what youre looking for in phone if theres anything youd like to know besides what ive told you so far or if you need me to go into more detail in something ive said ask away
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,you may complain about anything about this phone remember where the target market for this phone is my friend
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,this fone is way lighter and slimmer than the info posted
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,nit peak
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,spamton mar know you didnt ask me but depending on what you want new phone for could possibl more pls tell me more
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,bad device hanging issue and fingerprint scanner also irritate me thanks for this advice
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,well just one time major android upgrade and start from android this phone already like trash even this realese not very long ago
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,please kindly share your complete opinion on this phone if you already bought it im co more know you didnt ask me but depending on what you want new phone for could possibly help you determine if its worth to purchase this phone or not
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,im considering buying this phone as replacement on my yr old redmi note is it worth it strongly suggest you buy itit is so costeffective
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,my observation is about signal is weak
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,is it waterproof no however it is splash resistant meaning if you get some water on the screen or back you should be able to wipe it off quickly and it wont harm your phone
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,my honest review about this phone bought the phone for dollars which might be slightly more expensive than expected but for what it offers consider the price to be very cheap it has gb of ram and additional gigabytes of virtual ram the helio is honestly amazing some might glaze snapdragon and refuse to purchase phones with any other processor than snapdragon but the helio is quite potent runs genshin impact at fps on highest setting for texture resolutions it can run games such as deadly sins grand cross and free fire at fps the screen could use some better lighting but you get used to it quickly dislike the back not being curved as the edges hurt little but am getting used to it the special game assistant xarena has the possibility of mapping certain game actions to phone buttons however havent tested that yet and the volume buttons seem little far away to actually be worth using the phone charges fast and has options with its assigned charger lowtemp smart and hyper hyper charging fast but heats the phone while smart charges fast but heats little bit and low temp doesnt seem to heat it up at all except the charger but very little the refresh rate hz is honestly great in games such as free fire gives you the chance to react faster the storage is quite big and you can use sd cards aswell overall rating id give the phone is could be better but its still amazing wouldnt suggest the phone for those who only want phone for camera as there is cheaper options with better cameras for an all in one though its good offers great cpu speed great ram amount storage is big and has mp camera with ai assistance with taking pictures causing it to have much cleaner look would recommend for gamers or people who want an all in one phone and are on budget
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,bought it in the same price was getting realme vivo redmi note but happy bought this feels good display is good feels fast xos ui has improved have used different infinix phones in the past the oldest being infinix note charging speed is good gets bit hot overall nice package display amazing camera good charging good ui very improved now doesnt feel you are using cheap buggy ui battery backup good heptic feedback normal average backcam is good front could have been better
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,miracast
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,the only problem with infinix and tecno phones is their software xos and high os
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,well at this price point its all good specially for casually gaming and useable camera and it has good specs despite the price but no matter what people always complain if you guys complain about it being rubbish or something why not just buy high end phone rather keep complaining on budget friendly phone but my overall rating for this device is
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,this is by far the best phone have used in many years well worth the money paid for it stars
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,infinix hot pro is an excellent phone with great performance and smooth functionality ive had great experience using itits reliable and userfriendly

Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,its awesome with good specs and design
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,wish to like it but when see taaa it ok since here is not function really maybe all of specs from budget phone is ok
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,heinze oct people will always complain about any phone even if its flagship phone for me hot pro ok in terms of casual gaming it slim like specs also im fan of sd series but when im playing casual games it meets my expectation
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro 4G,ugly phone corners overly rounded

Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,for the chipset itself its true tho its only like little bit better anyway whe more the reason why device powered by the chip is better than one with the is that the gpu of the is inherently inferior to that of the meanwhile the modem in the consumes more memory bandwidth which leads to decrease in the gpu efficiency of the
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,got fe gb issue no fingerprint someone offered this phone gb to trade yes or no do it go for it asap cuz sfe is an flag ship phone check if its snapdragon version or exynos if its snapdragon version then go for it otherwise wont
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,hot pro is an awesome deal the price it is being offered everything is decent considering the price the ui ram management could have been better but you are getting more what you are paying for this gorgeous loving it worth every penny
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,normal hot cpu better than this helio for the chipset itself its true tho its only like little bit better anyway when saw the comparison on youtube the pro somehow is better in gaming than the one when it come to all over performance pro is still better they failed to optimized the performance of dimensity unfortunately
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,want this phone but im also scared at the same time because of its slim design has an more you wont be needing to worry about those because the will not be able to produce enough frames to heat the smartphone
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,theres no version theres version called infini hot check it out it uses mediatek dimensity chipset can also google search it on
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,thats different model for the version look it up it uses dimensity chipset inste more theres no version
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,not total rubbish claim thats different model for the version look it up it uses dimensity chipset instead of helio
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,but cpu and gpu is the same as whats the difference also ive seen thi more not total rubbish claim
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,this phone had super steady feature they think that this phone has ois but that more absolutely this phone doesnt have ois but it has eis that could minimize the shakiness of the video

Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,this or tecno pova depends on what want if want bigger battery and faster charging then the pova both have similar performance values too but the only difference here is bezels and battery the pova comes with headphone jack too

Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,which one would you choose this or redmi note both are great phones as own both redmi note and infinix hot pro plus it just really depends on what features you are looking into for me the dual app function in redmi is better as it can clone all apps unlike in infinix which is only available for socialmessaging apps
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,just confused with tencion group itel infinix maybe someone can give me some informati more infinix is far better than tecno and itell im phone technician and have come to realise that
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,everything look value for money but the software update like trash

Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,this is good but you tell me more details but this low price it good mobile so thanx how does the phone work is it standard phone

Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,am waiting the version when it happen and launched because lte based network are out of date and am need them for long term use thanks

Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,yes it does have sd card on this thang it is so slim the camera is just okay but for the price it gives more than expected love it
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,it can connect to wifi for the second question its bit subjective but still recommend doing all the preventative stuff to protect your eyes
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,what specs are flagship nearly
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,this the craziest phone ever seen man nearly flagship specs but it only got what specs are flagship
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,would be better for some more software updates
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,absolutely worth the money although but its fast
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,metal frame infinix hot pro
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,device unlock
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,beautiful beast exclusive bundle
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,can easily unlock bootloader on infinix devices is it like xiaomi in this regard
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,good phone however the claim of always on display by the brand is misleading th more it has aod but not the samsunglevel featureriched the info is correct in that sense but mm jack is the incorrect info no such port exists
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,sometimes cant say if transsion is the next xiaomi or just similar because infinix dont make lot of gaming phones like gt vs poco but their other spark pro for example was bang for buck phone depending on the regions personally never looked into this company until sparkpro and gt pro and itel rs those phones only want camon pro also as for hot pro this also looks nice like specs aint better too much but it feels okay ive never said anything about infinix hot series but this one is one of us like it can compete with the other chinese midrange their other cheap ones dont look nice spark pro for example looks like iphone in back and same with other series rarely some phones that feels like what should be mvp hot pro isnt over gt pro but phone looks nice its plastic unfortunately but if you put glass and aluminium you can make almost flagship experience most people who dont game wont worry much on helio like how some cheaper phones look expensive and hard to find phone with best looks and price camon pro is upcoming but sadly not in my region as usual
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,decent phone this price point got mine three days ago everything is well balanced no mm jack lemme correct here mm seems to be mm as both sides are curved extraordinarily got an update which fixed several issues improved the camera also got the latest security patch go to store and take the phone in ur hand then will know what im talking about was gonna buy another one renowned brand but after experiencing it for half an hour decided to go with it and not regretting at all if gmm jackultra wide shooter is priority to go grab anything but this otherwise its decent value for money phone
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,is any one with this phone experience any burst voice from speakers when on max volume sometime but nt always plz tell me
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,ltjuicyfruit dec bought this phone just few hours ago its an absolute steal for the price but it more mt once again being an absolute joke and giving every positive comment or people simply asking question with an or while remaining absolutely silent whats wrong mt too afraid to speak up so you keep reacting with these dumb emojis
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,design gives it bit of premium feel until you observe the materials its made of it more what do you mean in connentivity in wifi or the data
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,well infinixs software is absolutely nowhere near apples for such budget phon more would you compare infinix dead software to apple infinix software is do
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,this phone doesnt have mm jack probably because mm jack hole doesnt fit because of how thin this phone is
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,what this anonymous saying nonsense about only if you dont mind camera quality or if more well ive tried taking pictures while covering the two other lenses below the main camera and it doesnt seem to affect focus color depth recognition and overall photo quality whatsoever so what exactly do those two other lenses do dont freaking know and couldnt care less the cameras on this thing are subpar anyway
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,lmao you dont need dedicated portrait lens these days when the main camera can do it more well infinixs software is absolutely nowhere near apples for such budget phone like this additional hardware would work better than poorly implemented software bokeh so you cant really expect much
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,in my country this phone is lmao tunisia government are thiefs they make more money selling this phone than infinix
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,the regular hot has model so why not have version of the hot pro and pro my moto was with full connectivity
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,theyre probably saving their chips for the note series no the mediatek series does not support connectivity
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,finally beautifully best looking phone with useless cpu and gpu complaining about phone kek
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,havent seen itel sultra processor is worst with unisux
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,is it weak processor looks premium smooth software good cameras
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,this is verry smooth like iphone im happy to have phone like this
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,lol keep blabbering nonsense the cameras are actually serve purpose my infinix has two ca more lmao you dont need dedicated portrait lens these days when the main camera can do it via software the iphone se only has one camera yet it can do portrait shots and the results are just as good as phones with dedicated portrait lens so yeah while portrait lens is functional its largely unnecessary and all manufacturers should discard them entirely
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,hate how they keep putting useless or fake lenses to make their phones appear like they have more lol keep blabbering nonsense the cameras are actually serve purpose my infinix has two cameras and the portrait mode photos are affected while also showing warning if cover the other lens
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,jesus major update lmao
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,seriously hate seeing this mt dude giving the and emojis on comments from people who more mt hates the truth and people being excited about everything lmao user this phone is looking good mt user telephoto camera is more useful than macro mt
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,bro its less than dollars asking for is too much the regular hot has model so why not have version of the hot pro and pro
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,wich is better tecno camon or infinix hot pro plus planning to buy new phone infinix hot pro is better than camon
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,why bro its less than dollars asking for is too much
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,why chill its less than dollars asking for is too much
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,mazen oct ok ill be the one to say it leave the alone already let it go cut it loose gi more cmon atleast its the which is like faster
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,why
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,am the one who commented that the processor is nm dont know how saw another processor in the specifications after all the is nm and memorize the features of all processors accurately but this time didnt focus well
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,its wellknown fact that amoled is generally better for the eyes offering lower blue light and reduced glare plus hz amoled feels smoother and easier on the eyes than hz ips lcd due to its faster pixel responsetheres no comparison
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,nice middle budget phone
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,in lebanon little bit pricey because in iraq curved screens are no lo more will have to correct you here infinix hot pro has the nm and more transistors means faster
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,that camera roll is hideous lmao are they doing bootleg of samsung camera design combining more they said their camera represents woow
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,the helio only has nm processor not nm this helps to enhances power efficiency
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,one thing why is it so thin it is supposed to be plus not minus more in my case think the thinness helps you to have good feel
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,same oled is only for loosers and old people think you have gotten it wrong because this is an amoled device
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,jack saw this last few min there no jack
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,infinix should give it major upgrades considering this is pro plus model of couse
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,if only its ips lcd would be perfect and ill consider it same oled is only for loosers and old people
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,says who my optical eye doctor said oled is much much worse than ips lcd he is expert in this field
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,curved screen total misunderstanding of usability dont comment in negative way on product which you havent used you guys are making other buyers double minded regards ali anwar bajwa
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,up to major android upgrades perfect
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,ok ill be the one to say it leave the alone already let it go cut it loose give it rest move on stop renaming it every generation talking to all of you not just infinix
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,mm jack is no it uses dongle from their website earphone yes typec
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,the only thing hate about this device and about every other infinix device is the navigation bar those three things triangle circle and box the gesture navigation isnt also as responsive as the iphone device ive used the tecno spark go device the navigation bar doesnt stare into my face like infinixs
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,manufactured ewaste
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,that gotta be the lightest infinix ever
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,yes everything is perfect except the amoled nobody likes oled says who
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,does not looks bad but am not fan of square cameras on back
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,phone that is so perfect with an ip rating and micrk sd card slot and mm jack and watt more yes everything is perfect except the amoled nobody likes oled
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,what price prolly around dollars
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,weight gms that light weight
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,in my opinion this is great deal if you want to buy phone for your kids since they sold more what price
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,lightest modern odm phone is here
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,smitten bout that camera island tbh its technically not needed so yea
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,fake camera bump sensor size is only all cameras
Infinix,Hot 50 Pro+ 4G,tecno pova pro is better than this love tecno and zte nubia
Infinix,Hot 50,bro thank you very love this phone because gaming so power that battery very strong
Infinix,Hot 50,no its trash bro thank you
Infinix,Hot 50,bought ts phone and its really good overall for my opinion
Infinix,Hot 50,this web is trash guys infinix hot has fhd display no you misunderstood them this one with hd display is version of hot and the other one with fhd display is the version hope you will understand
Infinix,Hot 50,dimensity is just rebrand of the almost the same specs baffled me aswell learni more wait till you realized that all dimensity series are just dimensity rebranded literally all soc are the same as dimensity even newer ones
Infinix,Hot 50,worst release to date since hot overpriced weak ahh
Infinix,Hot 50,portable stove in your pocket
Infinix,Hot 50,which once pass lnfinix hot and lnfinix smart
Infinix,Hot 50,may ask whether this very phonethe hot one capable of running fishing planet smoothly more good for gaming
Infinix,Hot 50,gb gb ram gb gb ram gb gb ram the internal storage ins misleading bro just purchase this for my brother but good thing he doesnt care he doest give sht about the phone specs but still fix your typo
Infinix,Hot 50,does it overheat easily yeah
Infinix,Hot 50,my opinion about this phone pros it does do what it needs to do as gamer liked the phone got the version which is the lowest of its version yet it can do multitasking and give enough space for my amenities it had the dimensity which is almost basically the same as but its version it can do gaming enough to satisfy you but dont expect long ang exaggerating gaming the itself is ok but its jerky sometimes or maybe my area lacks connectivity cameras are ok but expect it to have but maybe not as found out that the rd camera is an auxiliary basically useless got it for very cheap price here in philippines it cost only in mall and it might be cheaper if you bought it in lazshoppe cons heats up very fast and very hot it even got to was so worried at that time because thought its gonna explode charges very slow and drains fast like at one time was scrolling in fbtiktok it took percent that was just min and charging it wont help as its only watts compatible and almost forgot infinix gives you watts charger watts which is so slow it even the brick and phone itself heats up quick not recommendable to use it while charging especially when using the watts speakers are not good enough though ik its dts but it just different from my old vivo this speaker aint making good music ill rather use some buds than listening to these speaker os sucks infinix doesnt support new updates on this phone even though its new it even have decent specs yet the os wont even be upgraded because the phone itself is incompatible no costume yet caseaccessories its still new in philippines market and people dont know this phone yet so be expected to use your jelly case for long time vinal verdict its very good all around phone for budget users as it has intergraded in it and enough for gaming though always be cautious of the cons as my self experience itandd it aint fun but if youre in tight budget recommend you to buy this if you have more pass this anyway but choice is choice it depends on you if you buy this
Infinix,Hot 50,two cameras onlyrd is fake loooll
Infinix,Hot 50,hi please check infinix hot supports nfc but heres written as it doesnt support nfc
Infinix,Hot 50,it have good camera and video record is pfps but why it doesnt have ois
Infinix,Hot 50,motorola is far more better option at this price at the same price
Infinix,Hot 50,this fone can charging wireless
Infinix,Hot 50,pls should buy this phone or the tecno spark pls reply dnt know the one with better more much better tecno spark
Infinix,Hot 50,level dust and water resistance
Infinix,Hot 50,why the chipset its dimensity in acount official infinix the chipset its the variant comes with this is the variant
Infinix,Hot 50,vice changer
Infinix,Hot 50,would you recommend this phone am about to buy hot
Infinix,Hot 50,how to get fps in pubg my friend just got infinix hot then he play fps in combathow chipset dimensity can able fps pubg
Infinix,Hot 50,its so so good on gaming am using it now does it overheat easily
Infinix,Hot 50,why did they reduce the battery capacity hot has ma the more fascinating it getsthe more they reduce the battery capacity
Infinix,Hot 50,so this is ones probably the global version for the variant just in case anyone more what is the price of this variant in malaysia
Infinix,Hot 50,yes can confirm that this phone had nfc in indonesia malaysia have hot fhd hot hd and version they didnt have come with pro and pro
Infinix,Hot 50,which processor was it then disclaimer we can not guarantee that the information on this page is correct typo
Infinix,Hot 50,dimensity and helio almost same but you can choose or network but prefer network is better
Infinix,Hot 50,my first infinix phone already satisfied me the performance on this felt pretty fast than and the display isnt bad but its way better than my old realme
Infinix,Hot 50,yuhh bought the phone yesterday though it was diministy procesor your website is not accu more which processor was it then
Infinix,Hot 50,bought after launched gbgb still using until now the cons for me only lack of screen brightness on daylight and watt charging the pros is networkhz refresh ratesony sensor megapixel cameramah batterybypass chargingnfcearphone jackmicro sd slot overall its good for budget phone
Infinix,Hot 50,my dad have that phone
Infinix,Hot 50,it can not push hz in ufo test
Infinix,Hot 50,this seems failure like samsung galaxy series
Infinix,Hot 50,not its not mine is variant in fact does came with nfc yes can confirm that this phone had nfc in indonesia
Infinix,Hot 50,in indonesia it had ufs storage camera sony imx no stabilizer from gyro mm jack bypass charging and currently the cheapest phone with dimensity although its debatable that this is actually dimensity refresh gyro is there but software the screen looks dull the worst of all hot variant tfsd card slot is hybrid so either sim or simsdcard come with charger that will absolutely ruin your battery and the phone itself xd
Infinix,Hot 50,maybe that was version httpswwwgsmarenacominfinixhotgphp this one was not its not mine is variant in fact does came with nfc
Infinix,Hot 50,design is way better then the hot series thats trying to be like iphone
Infinix,Hot 50,cons mono speaker display lousy design
Infinix,Hot 50,cant wait from xiaomi copying this exact same design on their note models just like they copie more actually there are lot of design guess they are little bit confused about the creating there designs you know
Infinix,Hot 50,bought infinity hot but dont know why the phone is very slow and the phone is more thats the software you know the helio id new chipsetyou just have to go for dimensity thats much better
Infinix,Hot 50,available on indonesia cost million idr for gbgb with dimensity
Infinix,Hot 50,in indonesia this smartphone have nfc maybe that was version httpswwwgsmarenacominfinixhotgphp this one was
Infinix,Hot 50,hp inifinix hot adalah hp yang sangat bagus apalagi hp ini berkolaborasi dengan freefiredana saya sangat menyukai hp yang di luncurkan oleh freefire karena saya main freefirewalaupun hp saya patah patah tapi saya tetep pakasain karena pengen terus main freefire
Infinix,Hot 50,its only gb rom thought for latest gaming phone it should be gb rom at least
Infinix,Hot 50,chip but hd screen is crazy any phone should have full hd by now hd should be gone like micro usb dont mind the ips tbh but the hd screen hope this isnt true
Infinix,Hot 50,in is not bad especially for this phone because of the entry level cpu it can perform better in than in this phone is great for those who want good gaming experience at low cost
Infinix,Hot 50,it must be mistake version with screen and version with screen because many brand need balance the manufacturing cost
Infinix,Hot 50,version comes with fhd screen and helio
Infinix,Hot 50,stunning design
Infinix,Hot 50,apparently we have the hot with in thailand and smart with that have managed to evade the sites attention
Infinix,Hot 50,to upgrade its processor from the previous hot this phone should reduced the screen resolu more think developers made extra income to flop the hot series
Infinix,Hot 50,massive improvement on the chipset may they never remove the mm jack
Infinix,Hot 50,the ugly camera bump is huge turn off for this phone they should have rather copied the iphone design like they have in the past years the processor is quite good for the price though
Infinix,Hot 50,the sony sensor in this are wasted no gyroscope means no video stabilization
Infinix,Hot 50,well that camera just looks weird at this point
Infinix,Hot 50,the outer camera bump makes it look wrong for some reason if they could just remove it
Infinix,Hot 50,samsung design
Infinix,Hot 50,bit salty aint
Infinix,Hot 50,the design is almost great but the camera bump is bit too far away from the edge
Infinix,Hot 50,the back looks more like samsung phone than any of samsungs phones indeed it looks very galaxy coded including the color options with redmi hints notice the iphonewannabe wallpaper as well
Infinix,Hot 50,battery life
Infinix,Hot 50,same it just looks wrong for some reason wasnt fan of the huge camera island that th more yeah that roundedsidesquare cameras inside the pillshaped outer camera bump makes it so ugly if they make the shapes more uniform square insides of rectangle rounds inside of pill or blacken the outer camera bump or remove the outer camera bump it would be not this hideous
Infinix,Hot 50,omo sha infinity really tried but the design actually bad
Infinix,Hot 50,infinix phones drain battery so much and it has no japanese language in the phone xiaomi battery so much better
Infinix,Hot 50,lmfao who made this phone
Infinix,Hot 50,im not sure why but looking at this phone makes me feel uneasy same it just looks wrong for some reason wasnt fan of the huge camera island that their recent releases had especially the iphone knockoff ones but not like this either dont think its the camera arrangement other phones have similar camera arrangements but look goodlike the infinix zero this one just looks bad inexplicably
Infinix,Hot 50,this is better than galaxy its actually better good job infinix
Infinix,Hot 50,what an ugly looking phone yeah always hated too rounded corners plus the alignment of the lenses is basic and less appealing than the triangular one
Infinix,Hot 50,nanometers chipset are you kidding me want nanometers nothing bigger and why there more lol
Infinix,Hot 50,id reckon guess that the pro variant would just be the same chipset as the more plus fhd screen instead of base model hd
Infinix,Hot 50,bro is asking for nm chipset on budget phone you want nm chipset for cheap slaps samsung lpe chipset there you have nm chipset phone for cheap
Infinix,Hot 50,not feeling this camera layout
Infinix,Hot 50,im guessing theyre tired of imitating the iphones camera design so they did imitate samsung
Infinix,Hot 50,hope next note series will be same design with this soon
Infinix,Hot 50,the cameras layout of hot it looks like having perisocope cam but its deco
Infinix,Hot 50,just rolled out
Infinix,Hot 50i,even if it lags no problem but crashing is annoying but for days now no crash
Infinix,Hot 50i,used to be fan of infinix product but this hot is hot mess the most terrible phone more very true so annoying
Infinix,Hot 50i,you update the xos in the morningit will crash in the evening bad
Infinix,Hot 50i,can boldly say that infinix hot is the worse phone have used it crashes at every mult more feel scammed just imagine not buying spark since the day bought it its been crashing even with update every month
Infinix,Hot 50i,you dont know what kind of infinix hot you people are using my doesnt have more can boldly say that infinix hot is the worse phone have used it crashes at every multitasking hangs as often as the blinking of the eyes buttons dont respond fast enough till you press harder infact can go on and on really feel sad to have fallen victim by buying the phone and surprisingly read very good reviews about it before making up my mind for it the battery is the only good thing about it
Infinix,Hot 50i,new update system crash ui and app crash just last month
Infinix,Hot 50i,crashed like times today im in regret since january need money to swap it
Infinix,Hot 50i,so been gb make it prone to crash or what are you saying that is what can afford there more yes my spark is gb ram since february it hasnt crashed
Infinix,Hot 50i,infinix hoti is good phone especially for gaming it comes with xarena which can be helpful more
Infinix,Hot 50i,less than months after buying the phone am already having frequent ghost touches very frustrating
Infinix,Hot 50i,should swap my infinix hot for spark please repl think yes if you have budget
Infinix,Hot 50i,you must be buying gb ram version recommend the gb variant
Infinix,Hot 50i,heared that they malfunction on their own is that true yes its true
Infinix,Hot 50i,what is hard reset it means your phone will erase all data when you hard reset and then if you forgot your pin pattern or password
Infinix,Hot 50i,never seen anywhere with gb and gb variant there are in trkiye gb
Infinix,Hot 50i,to prevent the crashinghard reset the phone twice trust me it workseven my settings used more hard reset you mean erase data because thats what saw in the settings
Infinix,Hot 50i,this phone its really nice the display and everything its perfect but one problem its hangs lot when its hot the phone hangs when your doing something important it hangs like it annoys me
Infinix,Hot 50i,even setting can crash no wonder other app can crash after update im changing to poco now rubbish phone crashes like dont understand
Infinix,Hot 50i,itel with gb ram and helio nfc dual speakers with better clarity is better option more infinix hoti is good phone especially for gaming it comes with xarena which can be helpful for efootball fans because mine own hot is carrying football with high player graphics and high stadiumgraphics
Infinix,Hot 50i,but may not believe all these app crashing and system ui not responding cos hot doesnt do this
Infinix,Hot 50i,lies mines working great even setting can crash no wonder other app can crash after update im changing to poco now
Infinix,Hot 50i,the worst mistake ive made in my lyf is buying the hot it has reduced my interest more you are very correctthe phone is always crashingapp error all the timerubbish
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,and you bet did bought phone with double the specs for the same amount dont get more which phone did get for the same price and how much was it what are the specs
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,bro am user of this phone it has some mistake that this phone has bypass charging and full more make payment via nfc available
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,please we need review on this phone
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,cant type properly the letters at the edges gets delayed so had to find keyboard app with width scaling hope infinix fixes this
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,as an month user telling all truth first of all this phone thickness and weight thats so good which is out of after that we all show gaming so thats mid range gaming like good but not very good at all and now camera is satisfied but not good it should give an good camera so overall out of you can but it
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,ive been using the infinix hot pro for week now as my backup phone and its really good probably the best bang for the buck you can get the screentobody ratio resolution and brightness make it look like mid to highend phone overall have no issues with it for daily use like social media texting and calls it performs well the camera is decent in good lighting conditions and the ui runs smoothly as long as you dont keep too many apps open in the background when it does start to stutter the system automatically closes background apps to keep things running charging speed is also impressive at you can choose between smart charge and hyper charge modes though always switch to hyper since smart doesnt consistently deliver the full charging speed battery life is solid it lasts full day easily and even longer if youre just using it for social media texting and calls considering the price at for gb variant and its pricetoperformance ratio theres really nothing negative to point out
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,dont understand why their version is hd lcd screen and fast charging only wow no external memory slot
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,of course hot pro thanks
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,its gimmick
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,it didnt charge in minutes it takes minutes to charge did you turn on hyper charging
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,why would anyone buy second hand device knowing battery isnt so good or how it was used more and you bet did bought phone with double the specs for the same amount dont get the stigma against second hand phones skill issue in finding one maybe
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,can it record voice when on call
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,hot pro and spark pro which one is better please of course hot pro
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,come on for in philippines expecting too much will not regret buying this have it more yeah that was super ridiculous given for its price it has screen downscaled to fhd and it was used the same screen from its gt pro with real res hope this wont get beyond including discounts
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,or you can buy second hand lastgen flagship with double the specs while costing the same pr more why would anyone buy second hand device knowing battery isnt so good or how it was used but hey you do you
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,have refurbished poco which is same price as this and no problem so far do you think this is better
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,thats crazy why this phone cant get years os major update this soc chip is almost the same as the hot pro only thing change on the ver is the cam sensor curve display jbl speaker and more ip ratings
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,nahhh why this phone cant come up with major os update this soc chip is almost the same as the hot pro bruh mean come on this is no brainer also love this phone btw
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,same as spark pro except wireless charging except the price is almost doubled
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,so easy to make sure just grab the phone on an official store and did screenshot then more come on for in philippines expecting too much will not regret buying this have it and im very happy with this unit
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,yes it is where is its watch offer how much is gb and gb ram of hot pro plus and how can get in myl
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,is it can it upgrade to versions of android yes it is
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,up to major android upgrades is it can it upgrade to versions of android
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,from video review real resolution is which is mean its fhd not in your firmware you extracted it looks like the hot pro or the spark pro does have screen in the hardware side and the software side it was rendered in fhd mode it was ridiculous build even helio spec have critics in terms of screen resolution and it was marketed as for the phone series kinda confident to say transsion isnt running out their resources building such thing at low cost
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,the resolution is just gimmick
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,is the helio the same with helio in terms of gaming its still the same with slight changes
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,extremely perfect entry level phone flat screen thin bezels sweet amoled screen ir blaste more is the helio the same with helio in terms of gaming
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,the infinix hot pro the infinix hot pro are so cheap and would have bought it with out more yeah
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,because its phone thanks to helio it wont launch in india which sucks
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,thank you infinix what an excellent device ai futures for just fast and smooth really
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,nothe tecno spark pro has it though so its much better to get that one
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,in if they put with similar performance as while sacrificing so much features and hardware then its useless to chase for the sake of it unless we are in then you can complain about it
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,proper successor of hot pro not exactly by performance but its got gyroscope it must support eis although locked in stock camera app only
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,pros minimalist thin body design available in two fragrant leather variants jung more does it support fps
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,considering this is budgetfriendly phone potentially priced between the complaints just dont make sense it actually offers much better value than many competing phones that previously retailed for around especially those with the chip and often only an ips hd display
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,believe infinixtecno now have released almost phones with these helio gg derivatives
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,forever lmao theyll use anything but chip for their cheaper models except if more dont understand why their version is hd lcd screen and fast charging only
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,how long is mediacrap gonna milk this yr old soc over over again forever lmao theyll use anything but chip for their cheaper models except if is the only standout feature of that phone when should be standard for phones in
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,new processor from helio coming from this phone might be performance difference to the more nah thats an overclocked gpu only
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,infinox should change their gpu for godsake
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,it is all the more worthy buy ing this phone if it has screen to body ratio and it wouldnt be long and the infinix note pro might just achieve it and iam willing to pay an additional euros just for the screen to body ratioip im not asking more
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,any price estimations
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,wth pls sybau its not bad
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,hey this is really nice and it only takes screen to body ratio to achieve that on the oppo find and ve said before it will take infinix months for them to achieve screen to body ratio on their mid range and it looks like they will be able to achieve this as soon as next year which is only mo from now
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro,looking kinda fresh
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,infinix hot pro plus looking for very will super prodect so read specifications better good
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,just ordered this phone today ill receive it tomorrow if anyone has question they can ask me the main reasons why ordered it is because the thin design lightweight curved display some ai features and googles circle to search
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,again infinix didnt sell the pro and pro model in malaysia just like the hot series
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,hahahahaha old flagship with terrible battery life good idea bro bro doesnt know about flagships that support fast charging
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,im looking at this phone right now and it does have microsd slot and it supports up to more it doesnt support microsd the one that supports microsd is the pro version
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,those who are using this phone what are the problems of the phone
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,deal breaking due to nfc payments not supported nfc available for payments
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,screen is good battery is fine processor is decent but camera module is only if thi more is the lense size not aperture size
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,think other company sell the phone at same price same strategy with transion group fyi this is friendly psa transsion group phone price will be different on some regions also to protect from the transsion group phones are smuggled to some regions which sold higher price they implement region locked on phone which means you cant use your phone in some countries for example you cant use indonesian phones in mexico or they will be locked like anti theft lock yeah really locked and unusable
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,lenses camera what do you expect from company like infinix techno lol always do your research before you come online and type such the first sensor is the main megapixel sony camera the second is dept sensor the third is an ir blaster and its also ring notification light around the ir blaster always to your research
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,the only good thing about this phone is the years ahead of android update
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,bashers can flagships if they can afford it fya
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,the only diffrence in plus is water risistent ip on the package it says ipweird
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,why they can put on it just sp fhd it just marketing plan
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,yes curve screens really turns me off
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,china nits samsung with same price nits
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,save ur money guys get an older flagship hahahahaha old flagship with terrible battery life good idea bro
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,infinix is the best
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,infinix hot pro plus is better that this it has bypass charging good screen ratio than more hot pro in indonesian version they include the microsd slot
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,copypaste of its sibling tecno spark pro with very few differences like micro sd card more in indonesian version they include the microsd slot
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,what is this what did infinix just release this phone is disappointment was looking for more fym they remove bypass charging they didnt
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,very impres infinix give the hot series year major android upgrade
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,maybe hz is marketing thing but its not being used on all apps only in the settings app more what do you mean
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,how are these phones hot pro hot pro reaching their hz display refresh rate when more maybe hz is marketing thing but its not being used on all apps only in the settings app can pull hz but only can pull up to hz depending on the apps works with as for the screen res helio can support up to xp which is technically at fhd so it is impossible to render screen natively but there is possibility to set the default screen res to fhd xp in their and you cannot set to natively it was confused for us infinix clarifying this it was marketed as screen through hot propro even tecno spark propro in this particular chip was almost baited me up but it was marketing genius though repeatedly
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,do the notification light at the back work for notification or text
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,what the heck low specs mobile trash useless phone throw away plastic phone
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,im definitely buying this phone bro ngl we all buying ts literally did
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,whats the comparison between infinix hot pro plus and tecno comon plus please nee more its the same
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,one camera that cant even do and the two auxiliary lenses just fancy more its cheap phone
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,just realized this is downgrade from hot pro the hot pro dont have nfc for payments
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,this one is the highest screen size to weight ratio phone please make hot mini version under mm width
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,wow the latest name for low end soc from from mediatek well done guys new year new name
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,dear infinix team hope you are doing well am writing as user of the infinix hot more you forgot software to make it complete
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,good phone am interested because of slim and light weight form factor only issue is lack of infinix should launch the version with better cameras
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,sure im definitely buying this phone bro ngl
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,its slimmer than hot pro plus sure
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,how is camera compare to tecno spark pro plus
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,not power process bad selfi camera mp so so power charging only in pakistan its spec more no even if mp it is still the camera sensor also use is sony imx same with most other midrange phone out there ok
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,its its not powerful why not powerful to helio
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,im really interested in this phone because of its thin factor but it still on also there is no info about the software support think this phone is okay for work phone
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,anntutu score below mil not good deal now ahahahah this is good for budget phone
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,sir next time please put if by pass charging ty
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,wow awesome just love the processor and the phone features have use hot pro so know hot pro will be better
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,there was going to be model but they upbadged it and now it will be the note exp more they changed the name again and it will launch as note
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,no sd slot big disappointment nowadays infinix
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,they need to make better chip and better camera in this body would be nice
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,helio and speeds are similar
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,camera use sony imx without ois
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,helio lol
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,which phone infinix hot pro
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,all these opinions yet noone is giving any specific review in particular about the phone itself from experience
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,thats what you get from the same company that made these phones know they are owned by transsion the thing is infinix and tecno didnt copied themselves over the years but that seems to have changed
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,not at all am using phone with helio and it is working well infact of users can more the mid soci had few of em last year ago ran brave browser app for like tabs and shopee also aliexpressonline store app it lags and stutters alotmaybe you are the type cant differentiate between hz and hz you cant see difference also
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,dont waste money om these phones hz is barely usable hz is literally the maximum refresh rate you could find
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,amoled screen edged screen design no rubbish phone
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,helio is crime against humanity not at all am using phone with helio and it is working well infact of users cant even differentiate between the processors most of the new helio processors work very well
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,its going to be laggy in multitasking ussages dont be deceived by youtubers they more gb of cant be laggy use infinix note with helio gb ram it can run so many background apps usually dont even remember if there are background apps running have used it for year
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,dont buy xos have too many game ads no adds am using xos version on android
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,ths phone is pretty good for its price the only bad spec that it will probably have year of more ufs is also dealbreaker
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,are you kidding the first thing people look in new phone in is and you people left it for other brands seriously
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,defuq with this pro version but no anyone that want to buy new phone more there was going to be model but they upbadged it and now it will be the note expect it to launch in the coming months
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,this just another tecno spark pro just rebranded different casing in case tecno itel infinix still transsion holding branch
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,they really made helio wtf please let helio dies thats why they have other variantsbuy the variants
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,for improvement minimum battery should be mah
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,cpus need to be at least ghz also and cores should be ghz
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,the dimensity has newer cores and higher clockspeeds compared to the more it has the same clock speed and cores
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,no card slot curve display no mm jack
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,the hotpro will likely achieve the screen to body ratio and the hotpro will achieve it as ve said be fore couple of months before and for those who prefer symmetrical bezels should just wait hold for another or months and ll most like also get an sic battery and addition al ip or even ipip it worth the wait it ll also teach what patience is
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,should have used cpu that is garbage
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,we need headphone jack back
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,yeah but only dimensity the dimensity has newer cores and higher clockspeeds compared to the and the added benefit of so that chipset would be better choice for that price and phones with the unisoc such as the hmd crest and crest max are better alternatives between and as low as almost quarter of this phones price
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,nits peak
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,and there are phones with superior overall specifications and better chipsets for much chea more yeah but only dimensity
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,hot with chipset and hot pro plus with rebranded version of chipset is wild
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,recommend one plss hmd crest and crest max moto series phones iqoo series are notable few there are older smartphones too if youre interested
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,the price tags in nigeria
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,jma jul there is no more superior chip performance for under and there are phones with superior overall specifications and better chipsets for much cheaper than
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,more helio slop cant wait for other phone brands to copy paste this and change the camera placement
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,why is there no upgrade like or years
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,looks interesting rip micro sd slot theyre removing
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,really thats the lightest inch phone ever
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,nits on budget phone is insane sad that it has only real camera than the other cam more bro how can knows its good or bad did you test it
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,helio is just another rebrand of an ancient very low end chip by this shady company dont be fooled by mediatek
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,dear infinix please make smaller budget phone only large people like basketball player more agree phone screens should be screen link brick
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,ufs really
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,whats up infinix providing nfc on hot series but only for data transfer and not for payments nfc transfer speeds are really slow only proper use case would be contact sharing and stuffs
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,cant believe budget phone without screen and you may want to look up what the is
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,also hope there will be an infinix hot series with squarish design like the one on the infinix gt pro but with screen to body ratio like the infinix hotpro plus along with an ip ip ipk and mil std metres drop aint asking for much and media tek will be fine
Infinix,Hot 60 Pro+,well this is real ly nice side from its screen to body ratio if the renders are true then this is the next best thing next to the tecno camon with its ip rating if the honor or the real me neo or real me neo turbo isnt available over here then might just try this thing if the ip is really reliable or might try the infinix notepro if renders true
Infinix,Hot 60,what battery is this lipo life ni silica
Infinix,Hot 60,oh god no why the power vr gpu
Infinix,Hot 60,think this phone will already kill fellow infinix smartphone at same price like note wit more with its lethargic powervr gpu thats slower than the mali and cores as opposed to on the sure lol
Infinix,Hot 60,how many os update will it get
Infinix,Hot 60,is hot support gyroscope sensor no only virtual
Infinix,Hot 60,whay is not have nfc
Infinix,Hot 60,whos responsible for naming phones at infinix you have the hot with support and more lol thought the same
Infinix,Hot 60,was angry at friend today he bought this garbage without consulting me basically more expensive downgrade compared to hot also dimensity is less stable table and less optimised compared to helio he thought he was buying gaming phone dont even call my poco pro gaming phone
Infinix,Hot 60,this phone doest not supper in the nfc in hot why infinix nfinix is not support nfc how cloud be real of in the phone info
Infinix,Hot 60,my hot is better with helio
Infinix,Hot 60,in their official site of infinix in my country malaysia it show that the the dimensity is used in hot but at here its dimensity which one should trust
Infinix,Hot 60,is this downgrade or become little more expensive looks still very good deal with that battery
Infinix,Hot 60,what if tell you get all of this for only in my country where is that
Infinix,Hot 60,would be good if they add full hd display
Infinix,Hot 60,love these company improving through evolution
Infinix,Hot 60,the second camera has mp depth sensor
Infinix,Hot 60,add better components and this could very well be phone of the century
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,pls does this phone has split screen or floating windows yes ofc xos has just check ram amount if more than its good
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,dont like it
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,number are lies am using infinix hot and have confirmed that number more why
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,spark is better than hot please can anyone help me resolve this im currently using tecno spark bought from someone im trying to login my google account but its requiring me to add the first google account that was logged in on the device because it seems like the phone was formattedi havent been in contact with the seller ever since then please is there way to resolve that
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,people said spark is better than hot their matter don tire me they will tell you it good later they will say it not good
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,its more funny considering some of the commentator here dont have the phone they more why did the system ui usually crashes and some times while using app it shows app error and take you out of the app
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,some people doesnt have the phone this is one of the best gb phone now how much is it
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,list of issues missing features of infinix hot no game mode cannot block calls more some people doesnt have the phone this is one of the best gb phone now
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,it cant even play danger dash the phone cannot even do whatsapp
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,bro can this phone run doodle jump it cant even play danger dash
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,to anyone using the phone currently does it support split screen and does it have floating window features
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,nothing really change from the hot its just the designs and ip rating infinix manufa more people said spark is better than hot
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,if they wanted to give you something more for they would even make mobile phone at blacksmith in the village
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,for people complaining its performance its only used for tasks and basic gaming it more its more funny considering some of the commentator here dont have the phone they complain lot also those who bought seems to not have full knowledge of the phones specs etc
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,ips lcd no and price is
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,no pls why
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,the hot isnt bad phone it supports all the popular high end games and runs smoothly with great network the processor is also an entry level one trust me it charging speed is superb
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,hot laggy hot plus fast charging plus android
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,as current hoti user only buy this phone if it reaches the same price as discounted hoti for and has nfc in your region turns out it has stereo speakers and faster charging than hoti dont get it if youre into any game expect crashes if youre getting gb ram variant the processor can barely survive running one app at time so its only suitable for light user if you dont mind the nfc tecno spark is the same thing without nfc but provide more ram within similar price range
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,hey saw your comment about the helio on the infinix hot can you share more about more dont even consider about gaming at least not mlbb king of glory cod pubg genshin hsr that kind of game casual games like clash royale pvz simple games run fairly well the battery life is quite good cuz the chip literally has no power im averaging screen on time with background apps running all time low ram is the killer weakness of these phone gb ram is barely enough to run an app switching app frequently would just reload the apps all time some app would even struggle to load like firefox with extensions im using hoti main sim alongside my for few months now cuz the battery life and everything else are good enough no wifi no cellular no bluetooth problems unlike some budget phone
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,dose it crash as much as its predecessor hot so far they fix that constant to more have hoti right now it only crashes if youre out of ram for normie who just use their phone casually it wouldnt that crash frequently few scenarios it crashed before is having too much background apps and too much extensions in firefox browser the rest of the time it would just load very slow not at the point to crash times per day
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,tell bro hot is the worst android phone have ever used wouldnt advise my en more we same same hot garbage every second its crashing doz pple gotta style up stop making fake things
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,still better infinix hot than pad infinix hot helio so suck at gaming nah just good at baterai bruh
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,save up more and buy cmf phone instead of this hot garbage
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,you say lots people really like that kind of phone where they can operate it with on more gosh
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,compare to hoti one more camera extra ai button not sure if there is nf more noticed infinix phones dont stereo speakers compare to some phones
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,main camera mp dummy lol
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,another useless phone from infinix your hot contains the same chipset and it lags and crashes always you better focus and upgrade your processors before bringing this kind of trash to the market
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,helio is such
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,bah internal storage using emmc while others has ufs battery using mah while others has mah even mah is exist by others and screen resolution using pixels while others has pixels so im prefer not choose infinix hot to be one of my favorites
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,it works the worst for my experience using it hate chipset helio hey saw your comment about the helio on the infinix hot can you share more about what exactly felt so bad in your experience was it about gaming battery life or something else keep in mind that the its for budget phone
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,the camera design is better than samsung itself because samsung use circle shaped design for camera while this one use rectangle shaped camera which is more matched phone shape itself
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,tunatoast jul selfie camera dropped on the top middle of the screen very original nobody does that today ok know youre being sarcastic but can you just stop
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,selfie camera dropped on the top middle of the screen very original nobody does that today
Infinix,Hot 60i 4G,better than spark lte and finally not but no depth camera and the design looks same with hot
Infinix,Hot 60i,stupid infinix while other manufacturers are reducing the device cost after gst rate change these morons increased price from to do they think we are fools
Infinix,Hot 60i,blud is not iphone air love the phone because of this two things nfc and infrared
Infinix,Hot 60i,infinix tried on soc department buh gb ram cmon emmc storage type not ufs back design good batterygood charging speed normal
Infinix,Hot 60i,the camera arrangement reminds me of my samsung plus
Infinix,Hot 60i,man that shade of redburgundy is chefs kiss emmc and the useless aux lens is annoying but it is what it is
Infinix,Hot 60i,emmc in good joke infinix shouldve been ufs
Infinix,Hot 60i,the specs is actually good the soc is even better than hot pro we cant ask more more it just needs hole punch display to be perfect
Infinix,Hot 60i,this iphone air isnt realsed yet but this phone will copyd will phone coming copycat air soon
Infinix,Hot 60i,might be real good actually with soc as great as an
Infinix,Hot 60i,chinese companies already merging the upper camera bar of the rumored iphone air with the more why dont say the other way round which is the air is going to follow infinix hoti back design soon

Infinix,Hot 9,redmi note is still very much better than this infinix phone dont throw your money aw more true my redmi note is still better than this or any product from infinix they use low class chipsets that are years old so they can sell their phones cheap its useless because even if these phones have cameras or cameras the images from their cameras would still be mediocre
Infinix,Hot 9,
Infinix,Hot 9,if may ask can infinix hot screen record yes
Infinix,Hot 9,when will infinix phones support usb type reversible charging
Infinix,Hot 9,the flash for the front camera is so dim making difficult to take selfies at night the ok
Infinix,Hot 9,can you plzz tell me ur comments about infinix hot especially camera result and its price if may ask can infinix hot screen record
Infinix,Hot 9,hot has not ram
Infinix,Hot 9,no im not comparing brand new phones with random people selling used phones on amazon more woah some comment like thou
Infinix,Hot 9,oh god know youre gonna reply with something on same intellect level as this comment more no im not comparing brand new phones with random people selling used phones on amazon im comparing brand new phones with phones that have been sitting in the box since learn how to read before trying to argue with someone that has more of his brain functioning than your own and shouldnt even be able to compare any brand new phones with phones from years ago its not my fault if you live in terrible country plagued by inflation and your comparison to the sd makes me want to laugh the is garbage and slow soc too bud its low end soc from literally years ago and once again learn to read this has an mp selfie camera so its pretty much just as useless as the cs those megapixels arent going to make this suddenly good selfie camera there are only two use cases for selfie cameras for sharing pictures of yourself and for checking how you look this mp garbage sensor isnt good enough for sharing pictures of yourself unless you want to look like the person in terrible financial situation who cant afford good phone and thus has terrible photo quality so itll just be used for checking how you look which the mp one can do just as well and learn to read again you can easily recommend phones with better soc to people who dont play games because the will lag even in general usage dont repeat yourself if you arent going to prove me wrong you said yourself that your lags and learn to read again and under fps in pubg bud thats pretty much as bad as my old oneplus one dont repeat yourself if you arent going to prove me wrong once again
Infinix,Hot 9,for all those asking for price my cuzn just purchased it few days ago for here in karac more can you tell me if it supports screen mirroring its used to share phone screen on other displays like tv laptop monitor etc
Infinix,Hot 9,its chinese product or korean
Infinix,Hot 9,bud the realme exists for the same price as this that has the helio though theres al more google pixel xl and lenovo pro are in completely different price range why compare this phone with them realme has powerful chipset but it doesnt have fingerprint sensor and has mp selfie camera which is not good for its price so youve to make big compromises in realme as well you cant recommend to someone who doesnt play games helio isnt that bad its more than enough for normal use and better than most other chipsets in this price call of duty also plays fine on it pubg plays at fps bit lag but you can make it play smoothly around fps using pgt pro gfx tool
Infinix,Hot 9,garbage do youve this phone
Infinix,Hot 9,hows the performance garbage
Infinix,Hot 9,at the same timecan use network in both slot
Infinix,Hot 9,from the aspect of battery camera and ram this is actually pretty decent smartphone choice the helio processor is also decent choice
Infinix,Hot 9,display is same as other phones in this price and chipset is also one of the better ones in th more bud the realme exists for the same price as this that has the helio though theres also the google pixel xl and the lenovo pro which both perform way better than this but not by as much as the but they do have much better displays like the pixel xl has amoled panel
Infinix,Hot 9,ugh why do they bother including whole useless extra cameras instead of putting the money to more display is same as other phones in this price and chipset is also one of the better ones in this price you can only get sd or helio on its price agree about the camera they do this because people think more camera sensors better camera phone so it sells more
Infinix,Hot 9,hope the is not gettin hot when you on the wifi hot spot havent seen heating complaint in this phone but you should remember that hotspot can heat up any phone even phones that cost more than this phony especially if its hot outside or if youre playing games
Infinix,Hot 9,its amazing put the cameras only one works why phones only have main camera that does of the work extra cameras are only used in specific situations like depth sensor camera is only used while taking portrait pictures ultra wide camera is only used when you enable it and so on
Infinix,Hot 9,also have the same problem especially with the otg not workinginfinix deceived us by more have problem that couldnt find the otg option

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,have been using the phone for years now well have no issues on the fingerprint camera and battery but what have in common as an issue was vibration the phones vibration feature stopped working for year now for me am planning to change it but sadly cannot find something to replace it think have taken all the steps necessary just to test its functionality even changed my os for it but no know for sure it is hardware issue and not software one personally it is big issue since liked having haptic feedback when typing or using the vibration feature when mute the phone and still know have message to reply to or even for new notifs dont know it bothers me with it think just got bad batch of vibration motor on the phone guess no problems with anything else though still the phone is insanely smooth for its chip and can still play moba games at fps smoothly at max settings honor of kings or mobile legends but remember use different os and tweaked heavily the kernel games to avoid only is still genshinheavylike though playable smoothly at low to medium cant bear to play at stutters even if tweaked the memory management and ram use of the app even the rendering to vulkan use higher chips if you want to play something as heavy smoothly and with no problems or if you want to emulate you should be better off to snapdragon chip and not this one

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,this phone won some award but all have seen so far are discouraging user experiences and thanks for all of them thought missed out on an otherwise great product whats that about carriers not supporting it in the us of they say there are no perfect phones just find what works for you and be happy
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,infinix pro is compatible to sim card dito
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,this infinix note pro is one of the best infinix phone have seen it has gb of ram and more thanks
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,wanna this phone look good for gaming hope in the next time wil have this phone love infinix note pro
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,hows genshin with this phone can it run on medium and high settings would probably jus more infinix note pro can run ultra or any graphics on the game with mah battery and use phone radiator absolutely perfect for gamers this phone is insane but in terms of feature note is down example android versionheating issue thats why recommend phone radiator gamers
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,tell us the reason for saying this which is recommended then tecno infinix note pro more gaming if you wanted battery life choose pova pro and pova pro doesnt have heat issue and have good camera in night only but if you choose max graphics games go for infinix note pro but your phone will drain faster and will heat issue infinix note pro has so good on gpu but not on heat and battery for me ill choose pova pro for gaming btw idh what inside of camon
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,between infinix note pro and infinix note pro which one is better infinix note pro is better as in infinix note pro gpu was degraded and also storage of infinix note pro is while note pro has infinix note pro has hz refresh rate but it only decreases battery so infinix note pro is good choice
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,yes you are right same issue is with my infinix note pro mobile my phone fingerprint sensor setting is removewhy
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,own one and so far the battery lasts over hours on normal use but if you use it for gaming more can you tell me what settings your phone are in like are you using hz or hz
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,yes it still receiving all forms of updates except os update the update will end in june more thanks you mike for answering during the black friday found deal of hot for less than the half of its original price here in brazil so far so good its very basic phone but way more capable than most samsung or motorola phones in the same price tag
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,quick question the phone seems perfect sense for me to choose but the only thing that real more own one and so far the battery lasts over hours on normal use but if you use it for gaming use it will probably last for around hours and within just hour and minutes can charge from

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,commonly it was phone ads you can free uninstall the program whenever just touch the icon if it opens to apps it means bloatware from infinix if it marked as ads and open it to download itmeans app sugestions since infinix same like realme and xiaomi offers cheaper price ads will be common things to the phone to remove it you will need some workaround
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,does not work with any providers in the united states it says incompatible so dont buy more this phone is for emerging market and they even wont sell to usa just in asia african or few europe dont know why you buy the phone that even not official available in your country that means all your fault on the oem

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,hi all would like to know the opinion from those who actually has the phone in hands if more the phone cameras are good at well lit areas and daytime use though the brightness is too much for some one thing that needs update it the stock camera app that doesnt have exposure lock option on either rear and front camera when shooting videos no matter how you press and hold the screen touch delay is annoying in playing game like codm its happening all the time regardless if you set it hto lowest graphics and lowest frame rate on codm you cannot add photos on your contacts should you want to personalized it

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,does anyone know the issue of redmi note pro where videos are over sharpened google it if you dont if you do and you used redmi note pro and used this device infinix note pro do you still see the problem happening here as well the problem happens because of mediatek video decoder which is supposed to be feature that enhances low quality videos but the results are horrible videos tend to get sluggish and stuttering with over sharpened quality and over saturated colors which is huge no for me in phone im asking about rn pro because it had mediatek cpu gt which is basically almost thats why im asking about this problem
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,may ask question its okay to use it while charging and you playing game no its dangerous to use it while charging as this phone support fast charging and atmost takes hmin to completely charge from to and if temperature of surrounding is not high it takes even less time but because of fast charging it heats up and if you use it while it on charging it not only effect its charging progress but also increases its temperature due to pressure on chipset so it might explode better not use it during charging unless there is emergency
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,it take hour min to full charge this is not fast charging but nice phone and value fo more either you havent updated your phone to latest version or may be there is some fault in your model or charger infinix note pro completely charges in hm and from to it takes min
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,no its dangerous to use it while charging as this phone support fast charging and atmost more it take hour min to full charge this is not fast charging but nice phone and value for money battery and not good battery backup time pubg lite continues total time hours min defending on your screen brightness and your speaker volume without games to hours continues
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,but the narzo just takes in hours minutes with support fast charging only am using realme narzo and it takes hm to completely charge and not as fast as you are describing am thinking about buying infinix note pro
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,please everybody see its processer its nm chipset its dub to buy this pho more most brands uses nm chipsets at this price point anyway so whats the big deal
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,sir stylus is not available in this price category phones if you really want stylus go buy more even redmi note series doesnt provide stylus but people are only criticizing infinix which is unfair infinix provide many good specifications infinix note pro is the best device of infinix till now with best specs in reasonable price
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,the phone isnt complete no nfc no infrared port no stylus sir stylus is not available in this price category phones if you really want stylus go buy used samsung note

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,well yes miui is extremely buggy and laggy from what ive heard but still miui looks more rn gud for selfie camera but infinix note pro is focusing for games selfie camera
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,tecno is the best phone it is superior to infinix have discovered that and have many evi more tecno cant play genshin impact in medium setting but infinix can play in medium setting tecno is gud for selfie camera not for gaming
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,hi please confirm weather infinix is good or techno spark pro is goodplease guode iam more more poco pro infinix note pro cherry mobile aqua max this phone is gud for gaming recommend this phone

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,still not better than my pouvoir plus
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,probably you need to upgrade your simcard to
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,how come that its helio gt here in philippines would be better
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,can do phone swap my infinix for infinix pro

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,red note pro miui not only has ads but is buggy as well its screen often get stucks more well yes miui is extremely buggy and laggy from what ive heard but still miui looks like an excellent software skin next to xos on these infinix phones if you thought your redmi note pro is buggy and adinfested wait until you see the infinix note pro and regardless the hardware on the redmi note pro is superior to the infinix
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,must work towards securing this phone by trading in my zero wouldnt recommend you get this phone you should look at alternatives such as the redmi note pro or poco nfc they offer better specifications and overall more mature software miui has ads too yes but you can turn them off
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,firstly dont have this phone im just commenting on what gsmarena reviewers obs more must work towards securing this phone by trading in my zero
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,what is responsible for ads on your phone think it is from your apps and mode of setting more firstly dont have this phone im just commenting on what gsmarena reviewers observed about the phones software and secondly the ads are not setting or third party thing they are baked right into the phones default software from the manufacturer and as far as know there is no way to turn them off
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,look at software section of gsmarena infinix zero review and you see what mean what is responsible for ads on your phone think it is from your apps and mode of setting do hardware and basic software have any thing to do with ads on phone dont know please can someone help me
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,full of ads adds can be turned off
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,surprisingly not that many ads compared to inifnix zero
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,get ready for ads when you turn on this phone full of ads
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,no it is not water proof and company never claim it watch valor reviews on youtube he soak the phone on water and its still working and he also drop the phone multiple times
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,so how well it does in broad daylight as its brightness seems kinda dul
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,are you mountain climbers or hiker ever since started using smart phone have never more screen protector for mobilephones are made for reason that is protection no need of being mountain climber or hiker even normal person cant gauranteen that his phone will never fall
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,infinix hot is mah right
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,why infinix phones have no nfs what is it meant for
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,it has neg dinorex tx glass protection which is equal to gorilla glass protection it can more are you mountain climbers or hiker ever since started using smart phone have never applied an additional protection to it the beauty of every phone is using it the way it was made
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,maybe got faulty unit with fake charger that happens lot maybe you bought fake one infinix charger never disappoint its fast and durable
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,the problem with infinix phones is about update by the past you can have one or two major os update now infinix restricted it so you cant have just one sometimes its very sad infinix note was the best made by infinix because of this aspect and use it until now it receives security patches and android one stability and without bloatware is thing cant live again want one more android one phone from infinix to jump again in if they dont will only prioritise phones that can give me assurance of two major os update even if it is full of bloatware
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,but what about display durability most infinix phones dont have gorilla glass protectio more it has neg dinorex tx glass protection which is equal to gorilla glass protection it can easily handle small falls anyway the impact of fall matters the most any phone without screen protector cannot handle falls
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,this will probably be priced around php in the philippines because the regular note was php
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,prefer infinity to techno in time of software and hardware but in time of battery long last more but what about display durability most infinix phones dont have gorilla glass protection so one accidental drop without good case and your screen is broken my cheap redmi phones even after high drops still screen is intact because of gorilla glass protection
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,hi does come with stylus thanks no
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,bay infinix not is not better phone because of one tin is that my on his no his self and more am phone and infinix have always been my best product there is nothing like software issues they have always been strong and durable
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,am having problem choosing between infinix note pro and techno camon prowhich is bes more would advise you to buy camon probut you can still watch some comparison videos on youtube and make your decision but picked camon pro for both battery and camera
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,go for infinix its better then techno and cammon infinix note pro its good phone
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,try to add video calling direct features in your mobile
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,my greatest disappointment with this phone is that despite all the gsm frequency bands it cla more why cant they improve their battery capacity to irmh
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,is this water phone waterproof no it is not water proof and company never claim it
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,camera still needs some work on it as oppo camera is better from infinix full charging time hrs mins depends on how much applications you are running battery is mah but works only to hours infinix have to improve this phone battery to mah
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,it takes about to hours for its full chargeyour company just wasted my money beca more maybe got faulty unit with fake charger that happens lot
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,it is ag phone no
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,why cant the infinix phone make good cellphone speakers it is ag phone
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,the biggest issue with infinix or tecno smartphones are their subpar sunlight legibility you more yes you are right they should improve on their poor display under sunlight
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,combination of mediatek chip and xos is the worst for device to compete in notes category yeah youre absolutely right about that
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,im not into games at all have owned infinix phones so far and currently own the more please note this device was designed for specific regions infinix and tecno phones are not international devices
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,its screen ppi is very low for the resolution its just that the screen is thats why
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,biggest wrong choice when you buy infinixtecno etc when you active using your smartphone outdoor why
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,superb low budget phone ips hz display with mtk processor pure gaming mobile more usually problem on infinix smartphonelike on hot it takes min to full from but another brand with the same only takes about
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,both the infinix note and note pro feature massive batteries and run on the mediatek mobile platform
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,no yesh
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,touch pad is not working sometime the area near etc alphabets is good if want it buy it will enjoy it
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,does infinix note pro really makes slow motion video with fps no
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,this mobile is outclassed my recommendation for everyone to buy this phone without any doubt is it one are using
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,when connect charging cable to phone charging led notification light not on that has been problem with infinix brands think the manufacturer should work on that led light that is supposed to light when the phone is charging
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,indonesia version has nfc yo nfc bro
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,too badno super amoled screen displaywhat pity
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,whare is led notification in this phone in the middle

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,infinix phones never seems to impress one bit it has an eye catching appearance but much lowe more please they are an upcoming brand so its fair to say thing like thatinfact mediatek chipset like the dimensity is on par with snapdragon
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,yes when connect charging cable to phone charging led notification light not on
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,the gb ram is huge plus along with the helio for gaming consumers
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,overall best phone but am facing one issue dont think you have shared have used my head phones after days headphones not working once again have purchased new one again after or days its not working dont whykindly guide us already company not given us the head phones for this phone ser or plz guide us which special head phones we purchased for this ser
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,infinixmedia tech has maximum quality brand note pro makes much sense need it if possible how much price
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,the specs of the phone is good with the exception of the mp non ultra camera without flash moreover it will stuck to android with not even security updates
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,samsung used the same weakaccording to you mediatek helio in their latest samsung galaxy more ikr

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,im using that phone since last month satisfied infinix great work done in such low price segment great working and it can be compare with mid range high profile phone compared it with redmi note pro it can be compared easily good work infinix and much appreciations
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,the soc is too slow compared to the rest of the specs so its not really big deal it more is from last year comparable to with much lower price whats your point
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,can some one try asphalt on this phone and tell me how it works its beast and its working very very fineeee
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,trolling is strong with this one absolutely how on earth can someone expect sd at this price point mtk is good enough processor at this price
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,waiting to see phone with mm king brick
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,price is not flagship how strange of you infinix every step you make gets better and better than other mobile brands comes with cheaper prices bt high end smartphones is wearer who knows where the shoes pinches much those who go for iphones just go samsung likewise huawei mates altogather
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,lots of stupid trolls here appreciate the company for providing us all with options if the device doesnt suit you just go get something else mediatek is still no qualcomm or exynos but they have improved lot over the past few years these trolls might not even know that literally every smart devices on their homes have mediatek chip inside
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,stop trolling and spouting hate for infinix if anyone dont like it then go to other brands which you like no need for spreading negativity infinix is getting better and better with time and its biggest advantage is its cheap prices not everyone can afford flagships devices infinix note pro is best of infinix till now and better than many famous brand phones
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,congratulate infinix for release of modern phones at affordable prices those of us who can not afford to buy high end iphone or samsung are grateful to you
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,theres no infinix note shame on you well im suprised that it have gb storage which is quite rare to see it in midrange phone
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,it seems most of you only hate infinix and mediatek so you say bad things about theminfact me more comments and feedback of some people are mainly for trolling andor bashing infinix and tecnoi hope there will be review of this phone on gsm arena to convince the most skeptical persons who might be potential buyers
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,can its get future android update
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,the phone manages to carry native resolution and hz refresh rate unlike the display of most other inexpensive smartphones
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,did the phone will support dual volte and what would be the cost of this phone
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,whats wrong with people why is everyone complaining about the phone and guys its just developing brand so they cant release flagships at the beginning they want to sell more units before launching high end phones thats why they are releasing budget phones with budget price and im sure that most of you are not gonna buy flagship but you just want reason to complain about it
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,love that infinix note pro want it
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,check redmi its miui is full of bugs and lags too much
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,swear have never seen brand as stupid the same time useless as infinix fai more and youre still making no sense mind you lower specs lower price how much do you think the price would be if it had an amoled screen hz snapdragon processor etc before you say anything on public space do some reading please
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,comparing my note with the note see no deference why not this phone has nothing more theres no infinix note shame on you
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,not flagship processor price is not flagship how strange of you
Infinix,Note 10 Pro,redmi note vs infinix note vs galaxy note chinese companies copy note moniker from samsung but cant give stylus pen for these chinese companies the easiest thing is to copy phonemodel names but its very difficult for them to give features such as stylus water resistance glass back wireless charging etc how can be note phone without pen

Infinix,Note 10 Pro,this brand looks overpricedmaybe they cant attain the economy of scale in production hard more in pakistan the pro gb version is available for rs no other phone with these specs cones even closer in terms of cost vs value so to me it is best of both worlds great specs and great very economical price

Infinix,Note 10,after days here is my review of infinix note display yes very satisfied chipset more recently bought the infinix note at flipkart diwali sale in india paid for gb memory variant after various card discounts cashback the phone usually retails for so instant discount without any exchange using the phone for few days now and just awed how much infinix offers for its price wanted phablet phone and got one huge inch fullhd display is very good for multimedia purposes along with those adequately loud stereo speakers mediatek helio soc may not win any races now but will plough the field form day to night build on nm tsmc fabrication process the soc is very efficient when paired with gb lpddrx ram multitasking is breeze and have enough overhead left to be future proof for next years as apps gets fatter and more ram demanding only supports emmc storage and my phone has gb of it gets the job done and can further expand memory with microsd card am very happy the phone arrived with modern usb typec port and the provided watts charger is fast enough for me the phone comes with neg dinorex tx glass protection which is good the weight distribution is very well done for such huge phone this phone is not doubt better all rounder than its sister techo pova phone must not be judged by just the size of the battery only

Infinix,Note 10,youre saying the truth have the same problem here the recording quality is very very more you bought budget phone what do you expect highend camera system keep your expectations realistic
Infinix,Note 10,got software updates in last days for me everything is great on this phone but still my request remains the same please provide widevine support to this phone netflix and amazon prime plays sd not even hd format its not fair whats the point having full hd phone when you cant play hd due to restriction for netflix and prime youtube plays full hd then why not allow other apps in full hd too please provide widevine support in next update please
Infinix,Note 10,good overall performance but but buti was disappointed by the audio quality while recordi more so the phone is well ok but in other hand peoples are complaining about the camera which was absolutely agreed with actually the camera not ok at all
Infinix,Note 10,what of the front and back camera especially the front that is whitsh they should address that too just bought infinix note and im not satisfied with the camera at all even after updating software the camera is still bad the front camera especially looks like torchlight phone camera this is very embarrassing and bad is there something that can be done
Infinix,Note 10,please which is best to buy samsung gb gb vrs infinix note vrs techno camon pro more camon pro
Infinix,Note 10,the infinix is better bigger full hd display it can also record video in the tecno can more omy really thanks you will realy change my phone to this
Infinix,Note 10,why do we have writing on the fourth camera of the note what does this mean
Infinix,Note 10,no matter what product infinix tries to make some people do say rubbish about it ive been using this note for some while now and its extremely great for the performance and cameras and everything im expecting this phone to be much more expensive than this but really appreciate the price
Infinix,Note 10,its kinda sad they removed the stylus
Infinix,Note 10,heating issue after min of gaming
Infinix,Note 10,am years old so need to see in big font for me to see clearly please let me enjoy the infinix note
Infinix,Note 10,dear sir first of all am neither hater of infnix nor telling lies your case is with an more okay thanks for your review understand you better now remember very well at carl care when broke my note pro screen they told me if they fix it they will also need to upgrade my phone to the latest android version which android then that the brand standard demands them to always release phones with the latest version only so for me think they actually know what they doing they have really work on lots of bad side of their previous phone
Infinix,Note 10,please shut up infinix does you people like to make rotten smell lies just to stain this bra more dear sir first of all am neither hater of infnix nor telling lies your case is with an older phone other infinix phones the recent ones have not received updates to android up till now you can check on google or read other people reviews right here on gsmarena am not saying they might never receive an update but there is no guarantee wether or not they will receive
Infinix,Note 10,are you sure this is good phone of infinix note because take new phone buying you more let me just tell you simple truth dont do infinix or tecno always buy iphone but because want budget android phone to save data and files for music work decided to try infinix and to my surprise this note to performence has exceeded the naira bought it for this phone is too cheap for the amazing features am enjoying gb ram gb rom is very fast the picture display is beauty and can be compared to iphone pro max display but nobody will tell this bcus they just want to hate and bad mouth this phone love it its very fast play all games smoothly the battery wow do no but think its bit more than mah bcus it last more than what have ever bargain for overall this is the best phone for now on budget scare
Infinix,Note 10,fhd super fluid display is it true yes it is its good display amon ips lcds
Infinix,Note 10,techno camon offers update to android while infinix doesnt and screen resolution does more please shut up infinix does you people like to make rotten smell lies just to stain this brand like tecno and infinix both are cool but stop saying there is no software update here it may take little time but surely you get to update to the next android version used infinix note pro android and when the android came and update came up and updated it clean and simple stop lying here this infinix note am using now is the best phone ever display everything perfect
Infinix,Note 10,can anyone in the house tell me which phone to go for between tecno camon and infinix note the infinix is better bigger full hd display it can also record video in the tecno can only do also the infinix has usb port but the tecno is still using old useless micro usb the only advantage of camon is the hz refresh rate but thats with lower resolution only resolution is more important than refresh rate go for the infinix
Infinix,Note 10,this is best phone in this range excellent lookmemory camera using redmi note but inf note is batter than xiami
Infinix,Note 10,by going through your comments notice the reality of untrue if you were experiencing problems with the phone or your previous phone why did you still went back went for the same thrush phone again we buy what we can afford and let that be big screen nice camera and big storage personally love the product and am impressed
Infinix,Note 10,please keep shut and stop trying to discourage people this is the best infinix phone ever and more wonder oif not god after changing my mind to hot wen get to shop to buy the hot they said dey only have note alayeme cried there obcus of comments abt dis phone hated it completelyit was gal dhat said cnt compare hot to note nawi suuld try the note naw im loving itgrt battery fast nd super charge infact dis fone is grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt nd unique for unique piple
Infinix,Note 10,the phone sucks just bought it days ago mainly for pubg and other gaming but the phone more please keep shut and stop trying to discourage people this is the best infinix phone ever and one of the best android phone made it never hangs it plays all games smoothly so maybe you bought the fake version from road side shop you better save money and buy from the shop original one and stop coming here to cry and post silly comments have been using it since it was launch gb gb rom so perfect
Infinix,Note 10,dont mind them that is the exact phone am using and mine has lasted for month and tw more note didnt put any screen guard the battery is stronger the camera is so beautiful and clear am enjoying it
Infinix,Note 10,was just about to order this phone but the reviews here are discouraging which is the next more dont mind them that is the exact phone am using and mine has lasted for month and two weeks havent experienced hanging like they say nor has the screen broken even after hitting the flor tiles and cement even though it will break based on the hight but its fine
Infinix,Note 10,the screen cast isnt working the xos launcher keeps stopping and the notepad isnt more update your phone they fix the issue of xos launcher stoping in that update
Infinix,Note 10,value for money phone
Infinix,Note 10,is anyone here using it coz am looking for little detailed review of camera performance as more its very good phone infact is the best camera is super great love the phone
Infinix,Note 10,blindly go for infinix note very nice
Infinix,Note 10,can go two days online with the infinix note blindly go for infinix note
Infinix,Note 10,selfy photo is not clear it is look blurred
Infinix,Note 10,the best thing about this phone is supports vowiffi in bharat
Infinix,Note 10,its phone worth the price you pay but the infinix software needs to be made little better application loading takes some time is this problem just for me does anyone have this difficulty downlaod speed is also good but when we open an application it takes long time to load and everything else on this phone is great except software
Infinix,Note 10,back camera is average and front belove average can say the front camera is not just below average its rubbish its one white something that rubbish someones face my old tecno spark was using is far better than it when it comes to front camera
Infinix,Note 10,if use another launcher like nova launcher in this phone after some time the navigation keys will stop working and it will say xos has stop working waiting concern xos launcher with navigation keys
Infinix,Note 10,restart the phone have off the phone overnight this is three days now still in the earpiece mode im going to claim warranty
Infinix,Note 10,using this infinix note for past week will it get android update pls clear samsung more bro you wont get android

Infinix,Note 10,only usd in indonesia must buy this phone it is really awesome
Infinix,Note 10,is there ufs internal storage or nor no its emmc
Infinix,Note 10,main camera pictures are very vivid as if it is mega pixels not anybody faced this or more my own back camera is bright the only setback in the camera is front camera it is whitish blur for the back camera go to camera settings find picture size turn it to megabits and turn on portrait enhancer
Infinix,Note 10,nice and sweet fast networking keep it up god bless
Infinix,Note 10,dis is indeed is very good inovation by infinix its specs is very fanatic only cant find the gz refresh rate as it is the pro version and tecno camon series
Infinix,Note 10,note that infinix never gives software updates this will likely not receive android even more thats my problem with infinix and tecno they must sit up cos at this very price other brands will offer at least android updates for at least once
Infinix,Note 10,poco better dont think so
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,this phone it was amazing
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,finger print issue please please my infinix note pro fingerprint sensor is not working
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,infinix should pull up at least one last update to fix all the errors in the phone my note more yeah thats true
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,is very bad that finger print has just disappeared in this phone infinix will chase its fans more finger print issue please
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,fingerprints issues
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,the fingerprint is not working again
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,this phones height is diabolical
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,mine too it stop working finger prints is the case here
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,please after upgrade it fingerprint stops workingis there any way of rectifying it or bring more mine too it stop working
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,finger print stopped working after update so bad please after upgrade it fingerprint stops workingis there any way of rectifying it or bring it back to work
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,dont update your system or fingerprint doesnt work exactly
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,can update it to android version and
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,my fingerprint stopped working dont update your system or fingerprint doesnt work
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,after purchasing this phone discovered that infinix is one of the worst companies in terms of privacy of course you dont want someone to see everything you do on the phone even if everything you do is good you dont want anyone intruding on your privacy found that infinix phones deleted very important feature which is the multiple users feature which is found in almost all phones such as realme and xiaomi as for the xhide feature it is big disappointment as there are many problems with it that infinix does not care to solve when you hide an app anyone can see which apps you have hidden by going into androiddata and they will find them all unhidden also app store apps will show all hidden apps and the phone master app the default cleaning application in the system will clean all your hidden apps and show their names to any user in the xhide feature there are apps that when put them in get problems like constant crashes and app stops when quit the app xhide closes its background activity and cant get the app to download anything in the background so have to remove the app from xhide to do any downloading and xhide is so easy to find and you cant hide it therefore if someone tries to access it he will find that it is locked with password and he will know that you are hiding something that will get you into trouble there is no camouflage that makes the other user enter xhide and does not find password and does not find applications as if the feature is not used by anyone in addition the operating system takes gb and this is very big space for no reason knowing that the system is very limited and does not have many features found in other phones such as closing the internet for specific application when entering app info and returning to the previous application using gestures instead of buttons by dragging the right or left edge of the screen and there is no ability to activate show notch in the system for apps so am facing the problem of the black bar at the top of the screen when accessing certain applications and games which makes the screen smaller and cannot take advantage of its large size and you cannot share any application that you downloaded from google play via quick share formerly nearby share unlike on other companies phones they only have dts sounds which consists of three options that all make the sound worse this is unlike xiaomi phones which have many options to improve the sound so had to download an external app called wavelet to make the sound good there is no screen color enhancement feature you should adapt to the original color of the screen without the possibility of making it saturated cold or warm colors that are found in xiaomi devices the cpu processor in the infinix phone is really good and does not cause problems with games as the processor usage rate in games is but the graphics processor gpu usage rate is with games which leads to significant decrease in frames and the occurrence of drop frame in all games in addition after half an hour of gaming the phone quickly heats up to or while the devices normal temperature is about the operating system in xiaomi phones has unlimited capabilities and provides second user feature that protects all your data without problems unlike what is found in infinix so really regret the day decided to buy an infinix phone instead of xiaomi device
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,update version my mobile phone is not updating till september
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,cant access pictures on my phone from every picture app please what should do
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,no most of infinix users have that issue fingerprint dead after software update im having that issue too currently using the infinix pro
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,you bought copyfake no most of infinix users have that issue fingerprint dead after software update
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,need to buy one can get it here
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,nice phone infinix lovely enjoy it
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,please infinix can make entry level phone qith ultra wide cam so seldom to find infinix phone with ultra wide cam
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,worst ever mp camera true the camera has poor performance it over exposes bright areas
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,the phones smartness is very good and the processor is very good the network is something else very fast in downloading and gets network where theres no network
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,not all apps support hz refresh rate refresh rate comes down to to save your battery more its useless feature have used other phones but those phones doesnt have like this useless thing
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,it switches to hertz automatically below percent charging also it is hertz in some ap more not all apps support hz refresh rate refresh rate comes down to to save your battery life its feature not fault
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,is this infinix note pro have glass protection yes it has
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,completely agree with your opinion prior to buying this already owned realme gt neo whic more same here strongly considered the pro for bit more but really wanted to get the biggest screen could get the newer ones are still big but theyre reducing the screen size slightly and its little bit disappointing the battery is still bit of an issue but its not horrendous do feel though will probably have to install replacement battery late this year or early next year hope they go back to screen size approaching next time think its real selling point and unique selling point they can offer if they are offering screen dont know if wouldnt just go for poco or redmi model hope they reconsider this because feel its bit of deal breaker for me and many others like yourself as well
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,why does the note have the nfc but the note pro one doesnt kinda regret getting the pro one lmao
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,been planning to get this phone during my annual leave around new year couple weeks from now just to replace my old realme as my goto phone for consuming media tiktok youtube webtoon and workrelated stuff already got gt neo bought two weeks ago as my gaming phone so definitely will tell my experience with this note pro later on for sure the size is literally just perfect its so hard to find that giant width and phones these days with affordable prices honestly not even infinix latest series the pro or their zerohot variant has that size and they only go up to which is massive disappointment might change my mind though if the rumor about the note pro is true and it has dimensity and phone size as well as sd slot and stereo speaker lets wait and see if theres another news next month on january
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,nice phone just got it now almost weeks please go and buy it it has so much featuresthat more will you tell me now about your experience of it with this phone
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,when charged my infinix note prothe battery heats up and explode it was very unexpecte more can you give me further information about this phone mean result of the camera and other features can buy it or am just going to waste my money
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,perfect smart phone bravo infinix the future is yours

Infinix,Note 11 Pro,with the bloat wares google adb app disabling and follow the process how wish they will look into all the areas you have mentioned and do something about it
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,no ultrawide camera
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,please im really enjoying the phonebut is it true that the phone is water resistant more no its not water resistance
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,sjohn jul would like this message to go to the product manager of infinix note aka th more with the bloat wares google adb app disabling and follow the process
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,please god bring back optical zoom cameras on infinix phones like they did in note pro downt care about mp or ultrawide all need is optical zoom
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,badly needed macro camera sensor disappointed for macro missing
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,the camera suffers over exposure and therefore gives poor photos the older zero has better camera the dual speakers on note lack bass its just disappointing phone wont buy another infinix
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,doesnt support volte
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,its the only reason infinix note pro will not available in india in india we have the infinix note which is the note pro in note the rear camera subsystem is taken from note rather than note pro to keep the cost low all in all see note is killer package if you manage to get the gb version for around inr during online deals throw in infinix snokor wired earphones for free
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,lufs is better than iphone max speaker lufs what do you think like this spea more its the only reason infinix note pro will not available in india
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,it makes all the sense in the world for me to get this phone as it has the best specs and the lowest price for said specs but it looks like someone vomited on it and doesnt feel comfortable to hold because of its size that is legitimately the only reason im not buying this phone
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,please bro what does an nfc means on phone near field communication
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,no nfc what sillyness please bro what does an nfc means on phone
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,hi guys proximity sensor is must important thin in infinix while redmi note series and note series havnt also infinix note comes with these cam sensors omnivision ovc main cam and galaxycore gc in depth and samsung skl telephoto and hynix hiq selfie price is great with this specifications
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,had the infinix note since last year gifted it to family member and bought the new infin more wont lie wont read all that but since you are happy with it and yes some models are value for money at least on paper might change my view of it but not where it is now meizu and xiaomi and realme were much more solid bang for buck at the time and much more refined but respect effort you put to that essay and am glad you are happy with your phone and hope eveyone else is
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,agree with everything and said it million times to people but have to bear with latest more had the infinix note since last year gifted it to family member and bought the new infinix note with gb configuration price was ludicrously cheap at inr just could not resist the awesome deal going on as normally it retails for inr for the gig ram variant in india in india we get the note rather than the infinix note pro both are same except that note rear camera subsystem in lifted from note rather than the pro variant to keep the cost slightly lower in fiercely competitive markets like india everything else between and pro are the same note is great phone for its price as the phone does not feel cheap be it looks built quality overall aesthetics design on the contrary it feels quite premium for its price bracket own samsung galaxy as and will say infinixs xos ui is as bloaty as samsungs oneui however you can avoid almost all of the bloat and spammy notifications if you know how to setup the os from scratch oneui is undoubtedly the better ui eyes closed but xos is not bad either it is very feature rich and quite polished the phone came with android and know it will stay with android have no issues with that but infinix in the meantime will go on adding new features and android security patches for example with an ota update received memory fusion tech which is using to gb of the inbuilt fast ufs storage as an extended ram useless feature admit currently followed by all smartphone manufacturers for marketing reasons have disabled it as of now the phone looks classy and that huge inch fullhd ips lcd display is joy to view with hz refresh rate enabled in the phone ui feels fluid generally infinix displays used to have very low display brightness to save cost but gradually they have been increasing the brightness levels over generations and note display is ample bright and viewing angles are great with this big display and dual stereo speakers it becomes multimedia monster this phone have better built quality than similarly priced realme and poco phones the hardware is also very well optimized with the moderately powerful mediatek helios soc infinix have also optimized their xos over android very well as am amazed with the marathon battery backup it is returning with hz refresh rate always enabled standby battery drain is near zero hence hardware software on this phone is working on perfect harmony give infinix lot of credit for this presence gb lpddrx ram and gb ufs storage is definitely helping the mediatek soc to reach its full potential the phone comes with dual sim support and dedicated memory card slot with hz enabled the very well optimized xos ui is fluid as butter and fast too am amazed as do not notice any hiccups anywhere while browsing with soc am not gamer by any way and do not think it is gaming phone by any stretch of imagination as infinix advertises instead infinix note is workhorse which is going to take you through the day and perform the daily chores with ease call quality call reception are good on this phone if not great it justifies its price it is proper volte device but supports no carrier aggregation camera performs decent for phone but phones from xiaomi realme have better cameras the phone charges pretty fast with the bundled watts fast charger no complaints here in the end must admit for the meagre paid for infinix note it exceeded all my expectations cannot ask infinix for anything more well done infinix
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,airplane mode automatically on at am please help me out this problem

Infinix,Note 11 Pro,dimensity is pricier if they use dimensity the price of the phone will be way higher than it is now its not bad theyre using helio other brands like vivo and oppo are also using helio for their phones which are more costly than this transsion brands tecno itel and infinix

Infinix,Note 11 Pro,it has thermal protectionhz sharp display decent chipsetdecent camera at more some people have brand phobia
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,its direct competitor to redmi note pro and is probably far better the only drawback being ips panel instead of amoled so far my experience has been good with it
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,its the end of and this smartphone is still using the nm chipset wake up this phone can run genshin
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,lcd displaymediatek processor no software team better go for samsung

Infinix,Note 11 Pro,dont buy this phone infinix mobile does not upgrade their phones os to new os they re more then gonna get security updates and after warrenty goes out can root your phone at carlcare service center to use custom rom if dont like it
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,im using infi note pro right now and chip version here on philippines gt think th more still xos ib btr than the memeui hate that fking ui

Infinix,Note 11 Pro,if theres telephoto cam then whats the need of depth cam very good im writing for the phone
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,is this thing available to the philippines no
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,thank goodness infinix left the side mounted sensor for fingerprint all there attempts to bring it inscreen is just not worth it
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,how to unlock its touching behind or front of screen please side on the botton power
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,at least put an amoled screen to this rubbish stop being toxic the price suits well even do it doesnt have an amoled display
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,how enticing dont even know how to describe how feel after going through the specifications id like to purchase this phone rather than buying zero pro because am sure it will save some money
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,please will like to know if the infinix note pro would be recommended for livestreaming and live chats thanks
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,are you not aware that their primary target markets are emerging markets in africa and asia more for your information huawei mate has inches oled screen all samsung galaxy tab series has amoled screen
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,deleted post am in love with note though am not touching it before hope it would be ok to go withso what the price here in nigeria
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,does the telephoto camera have optic zoom
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,nice features hope it doe have voice record while on call because xpen am using dont have it
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,solid smartphone that gives good experience as you get mindblowing mediatek processor
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,mah of battery doesnt really matter if your chipset is of nm process it ain more redmi note pro has chipset built on nm infrastructure and its battery is mah and its considered to be amongst the best budget gaming phones in recent years with brilliant battery life its not all down to hardware software optimization can account for huge gains in battery life the iphone pro max battery is only mah and battery is exceptional
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,have been using ips lcd for long have no complain at all tbh but want to have the ta more amoled is vastly overrated its just people trying to show off or trying to justify their massively overpriced phone that talk up amoled have owned and used both types love huge screens on phones would go for lcd over amoled anytime the difference in price doesnt equate to the difference in quality have poco with samsung amoled panel hate the thing am using the infinix zero with quality lcd and love it the poco was over euros the infinix was euros great value
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,when are these guys making an amoled display everything else is good but the ips brings it al more are you not aware that their primary target markets are emerging markets in africa and asia one of their biggest markets is nigeria theyre trying to keep the price down have poco with samsung amoled and an infinix zero with lcd yes the amoled is better but its not really that much better youre going on as if its like the difference between crt tv screen and an oled tv screen and its not they cant make phones with amoled screens and panel for under euros its not going to happen theyre not apple or samsung and dont have limitless funds and resources theyre cleverly targeting market that is largely untapped if they decide to go with amoled most amoled manufacturers dont make panels for start so theyre going to have to reduce the size and enter into expensive contracts with suppliers and theyll have to put up the cost and will not sell as much thats how to end up destroying your business
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,im surprised infinix puts camera that doesnt shoot in phone like this and more you are correct bro this phone should not have downgraded in that area sadly one of the features to enjoy on the big display is left out
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,super amoled snapdragon then at least resn will be good also compass and gyro nfc
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,what exactly is the point of releasing new versionif the specs are lower or the same as more do not believe this specifications
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,it clearly states that there are bands available what are you on about know its compatible im talking about comparability with all the frequencies some phones are some arent depending of the gsm provider and countrytry to read and understand peoples queries before typing such replies
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,some people do like big devices to me this size is just perfect thumbs up infinix
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,so infinix tecno phones are not compatible with all lte bands it clearly states that there are bands available what are you on about
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,how is it smooth how does the battery drain does it run android or go
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,hope there is custom recovery the last infinix phone that have hot xc can be up more how
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,worst device at this price
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,downgrading camera from to in the matter of months dont think it makes sense to me
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,change that processor go for amoled
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,gpu kinda bad they couldve put malix instead
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,yea yea infinix keep using that chipset
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,pray gsmarena release tge review lf this smartphone
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,the company should add and in this price range they should give option for camera module
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,think note pro will be better than this phone
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,need it when alive to the market
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,cpu gpu camera downgrade for hz
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,mi proinfinix zero xhuh
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,gsmarena should ppls help with full and unbiased reviews of infinix xero pro and infinix note pro asap
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,actually they have triggers with volume key tho dont know any other phone more tired that volume button as triggers but it is hard to press while playing games
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,seriouslyips lcd why ditching the amoled display for ips lcdinfinix should maintain the amoled display in its new and latest devicesmaybe for the original and pro modelsmoreoverthey should make the depth sensor mp or mpand there is no ois or gimbal stabilization in their camerasinfinixcome up with something better if you want big market
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,do you know lot about technology of tvs smartphones tablets pc monitors etc more false amoled panel is far better than ips or lcd ones can understand you if you talk me about cost consideration
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,infinix should always consider amoled and snapdragon you re just locked on snapdragon chipset yet when you compare it with mediatech mediatech is always faster opening apps quicker good at gaming than snapdragon multitasking is superb on mediatech big up infinix continue with mediatech chipset
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,disagree lcd has many advantages over amoled amoled is seen as superior just because mark more what advantages
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,sadly without an amoled display its not intresting realme do more better this aint realme phone take your fish bait somewhere else
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,cpu downgraded for hz
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,infinix still has lot to put into consideration amoled screen chip camera software and the notification feature for their phone hope those with infinix hot lite notice it would take redmi nt for budget ph
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,nice work but no amoled no why
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,infinix should please concentrate on phones with underdisplay fingerprints but whats more can only be implemented on amoled under display fingerprint scanners only work on amoled and cannot on lcd at this time putting it in means amoled screens means higher bill of materials and higher final price but it wont happen because they are targeting emerging markets in africa and asia so trying to stay within certain price range
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,great mobile phone its indeed great phone
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,not bad
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,almost there dontt mind paying extra bucks for amoled
Infinix,Note 11 Pro,nice upgradation goodies for lower price infinix

Infinix,Note 11,battery drine issue reset the mobile after backing up your files had the issue where system was taking gb storage and battery used to drain like percent to dead when idle during the night factory resetting fixed both of these things battery drain also reduced also check if you disabled all the blotware in the device usually after google play services updates it automatically gets re enabled and causes issues like these

Infinix,Note 11,the phone lacks the technological edge like that of samsung or any other reliable brand the software keeps hanging despite high ram and memory the font size is painfully small extreme problem for people above or who use reading glasses there are unnecessary loads of built in applications which keep the desktop crowded you cant uninstall them or delete them the traditionally buttons like that for taking screen shot are different and it takes while till one figures them out the operating soft ware has lots of glitches and gets stuck many times the after sales services are almost non existent in my opinion this phone is waste of money extremely unreliable and headache one should rather go for any other reliable brand with better operating soft ware

Infinix,Note 11s,in game and in app it performs very well one weird thing tho is that home screen and ui itself is not optimize it stutter as if you are using gb ram phone camera is just terrible for me especially front facing cam it looks like it has some creamyblurry effect
Infinix,Note 11s,think to buy infinix but some one told that it is good other else told that it is bad what can do now please suggest me
Infinix,Note 11s,used the phone for months now and have not experience any issues whatsoever it is great phone for its price the cameras are good not great but at the same time not terrible it has stereos speakers and matte finish build that gives it premium feel even though it is plastic last software update received was this month april it has some bloatware but can easily be uninstalled or disable same goes with ads performance wise havent notice any stutter or fps drop from playing games such as mobile legends cod and free fire even in high settings hopefully in the future the processor will be optimize so it will run much more smoother overall with the price of php or usd give it an rating
Infinix,Note 11s,bro why so many cameras please make it simple like apple it literally has cameras like apple albeit apple cameras are light years ahead of infinix
Infinix,Note 11s,brought my infinix note last month at first its good but know the charging are sto more same happened to me note just have the usb charging port replaced paid for that in carl are but any phone repair shop can do that good luck

Infinix,Note 12 (2023),would really love to try this smartphone by infinix the features such as mediatek helio chip mah battery backup mp camera etc are cool
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),if were talking about newly released phone this is the peak if youre including more recently released still not the best theres the nova if you dont mind huawei same pricing better cameras way better soc sure smaller battery but twice as fast charging speed edit ok suppose it is technically year old at this point
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),anyone know how to prolong this device always on display its to short only sec then what the point of naming always on display just now so many brand do this their always on display only for short time
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),couldnt be further from the truth if were talking about newly released phone this is the peak if youre including something from years back then youre right
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),at this price this phone is definitely steal probably the most you can squeeze out of this more couldnt be further from the truth
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),nm soc but cant even capture video helio series is just grabage for phone under its very nice addition as it can record pfps also series is made for gaming not for professional use if ya want recording then consider buy cinematic camera aka sony
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),why theres too much infinix note series trying to be xiaomi
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),it cost about euro in malaysia
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),why phone makers making display they always know everyone like compact device li more how do you know and have you suryeved before or perhaps you are in the managerial level brother
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),they are not serious just pumping out devices after devices with little to no existent so more youre very correct no software support at all
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),its quite rare to have phone thats capable to record in but most of the time with helio and only saw it only can record up to on most branded phones like xiaomi
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),october
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),these guys are living in the future and beyond they are not serious just pumping out devices after devices with little to no existent software support
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),if lower than usd superb
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),someone tell them that it is umm not or they are pretending to be the greates more you can say same to fifa and pes too
Infinix,Note 12 (2023),gb ram and above specs for is definitely worth the price
Infinix,Note 12 5G,the phone do not have accessibility its network infinix company lied to the public think you got the infinix note turbo this doesnt has
Infinix,Note 12 5G,is it ois stabilization this phone doesnt has ois lot of samsung phone has ois
Infinix,Note 12 5G,manufacturer says abgnac wifi this page says abgn only which is true
Infinix,Note 12 5G,in photography the term qvga refers to video resolution of pixels qvga stands for more qvga camera on infinix smartphone is only for ai and night mode sensor not for taking picture
Infinix,Note 12 5G,this is what need for phone under dollars dimensity or snapdragon mp camera mp telephoto or mp mp telephoto yes and eis or ois whatever stabilisation take it mah gb ram amoled screen wich is the best thing to get good screen in phone with less battery consuption more durable more fps games
Infinix,Note 12 5G,phone ok but no punch hol display screen size ok
Infinix,Note 12 5G,can any mobile expert confirm me if infinix ai servers are in hongkong or china kn more
Infinix,Note 12 5G,wish they put much better old soc like dimensity or that has much better gpu
Infinix,Note 12 5G,triple mp mm wide pdaf mp depth qvga more its almost the same iphone selfie cam and just to get third cam not worse than those mp makro cams
Infinix,Note 12 5G,for only eur this is really good deal the pro doesnt make sense for anyone
Infinix,Note 12 5G,good device for its price but qvga cam gives me creeps
Infinix,Note 12 5G,only is huge deal breaker its fine its supports sd slot

Infinix,Note 12 G96,why the software info on the app is still android along with xos the phone got updated to android along with xos so pls update this little info gracias
Infinix,Note 12 G96,guys after the android update the phone is getting good work from its hardware and battery more bro noticed that the battery takes much longer time to charge after the android along with xos update quite worried about this
Infinix,Note 12 G96,after updated my infinix to experience problem on wifi connection cannot connect to the wifi anyone know how to fix this
Infinix,Note 12 G96,guys the infinix note just released the software update to for does who update more none update is so good
Infinix,Note 12 G96,bought this fone new days ago drains battery faster crash apps games lags on whatsapp camera quality average not good not worst price is rs high in pakistan and quality is less than average if you want to buy in pakistan dont go for it
Infinix,Note 12 G96,this phone would only be stable through apps that are not in gaming this phone is not for gaming guys pubg always lags even though its displayed in the box games like pubg call of duty and genshin impact doesnt play well and are not optimized in this phone because the touch sensor always disconnects whenever you play games
Infinix,Note 12 G96,why is the infinix noteg gyro so slow in call of duty mobile is it still possible to fix it
Infinix,Note 12 G96,based on the provided information would rate the infinix note as follows performance the mediatek mt helio chipset and gb of ram should provide decent performance for daily tasks and casual gaming but it may not offer toptier performance for more demanding applications camera the triple camera setup with mp main camera mp depth sensor and qvga camera appears decent but without further details or sample images its difficult to assess the overall camera quality accurately display the amoled display with size of inches and resolution of pixels should offer vibrant colors and good visual quality especially with the inclusion of corning gorilla glass for protection software the phone runs on android with the xos interface which provides range of features and customization options however the experience may vary depending on the specific implementation of xos design the phone features glass front plastic frame and plastic back which is standard design for many midrange devices it may lack the premium feel of devices with higherend materials overall the infinix note appears to offer decent specifications for its price range however keep in mind that these ratings are based on the provided information and actual performance may vary its recommended to read detailed reviews and compare it with other available options to ensure it meets your specific needs and preferences
Infinix,Note 12 G96,does any one know will this phone get android update
Infinix,Note 12 G96,just sell the phone and buy another you may lose some money from the original price but it more yes might be this phone just limits me on playing any fps games even the one that this phone is sponsoring pubg cant even properly play due to swipe delays losing touch after using four fingers some kind of ghost touch
Infinix,Note 12 G96,fantastic phone been using it for months os chipset battery display audio more is your phone display fine the chipset are notorious when it comes to heat
Infinix,Note 12 G96,iam so disappointed to using this devicethis divice increase temperature too much and sometime it also hangsiam using even iam not gaming on this device just use this for social media and multimedianew update of this phone has lots of bugsinfinix should clear all of these issue and give us new update with no bugs
Infinix,Note 12 G96,why infinix note delay gyroscope from pubg please fix it also encounter it but it doesnt even problem touch delay cause fast tapping
Infinix,Note 12 G96,looking at the gps unlike most phones you have other positions like gps glonass galileo bds think infinix messed up here big time for that reason im not buyer for now
Infinix,Note 12 G96,such great phone think only have issue with this phone that cant open instagr more can you go high settings in genshin
Infinix,Note 12 G96,does this have an update to xos or does infinixthe company give software updates ive been using this phone since august and theyve only sent some security patch updates so far they havent gave android update or some major os updates even though they already have the newer xos and android
Infinix,Note 12 G96,storage uses ufs same as note pro my ask where did you get that info because ive been finding it ever since bought this but cant find any credible sources
Infinix,Note 12 G96,so good at gaming and battery life and yet havent seen any problem so far
Infinix,Note 12 G96,its good for gaming but the gyro in battle royales are delayed
Infinix,Note 12 G96,why does my note have watts charger you are lucky
Infinix,Note 12 G96,hey the touch screen just immediately stopped one day and ghost touches along the center of the phone became prominent is this hardware issue or software one dont have cracks on my screen and the few times it fell from my hand it had secure case the phone didnt fall when the touch display stopped functioning though did you have similar experience or is it just me
Infinix,Note 12 G96,great phone battery screen and performance for its price range is outstanding speaker is average but sufficient enough fast charging is plus camera is bit meh but it gets the job done would recommend to buy the gb variant when purchasing for the peace of mind of not having enough storage it really quickly adds up when you use this phone as your daily
Infinix,Note 12 G96,for pubg no very bad gyri whats connection of gyro
Infinix,Note 12 G96,infinix phones never get android updatesonly security patch updates you sure
Infinix,Note 12 G96,some of you didnt watch phone review first in youtube before buy the new phone then complaint about the delay and gyro on itinfinix note has no proper gyro dan it refresh rate only ghznoted
Infinix,Note 12 G96,yes its worse do you have solution with that
Infinix,Note 12 G96,guys please help me should buy it or not buy
Infinix,Note 12 G96,think there is bug with the data settings data usage upon restricting an app something pop up telling you the app has been ban from using internet which is what exactly want for data saving if you go to the three dot above the screen and tap on no longer show up it will still pop up again even though you tapped it mind reporting this bug
Infinix,Note 12 G96,sadden drop on the ringtones sound and yet the volume key is fully
Infinix,Note 12 G96,are the graphics ok like hd yes the graphics is absolutely great
Infinix,Note 12 G96,have concern about amoled burn do you think its still an issue with phone always ha more they are vulnerable to heat as well but there is one way to avoid concerning about amoled make sure you have screen timeout of sec and brightness below
Infinix,Note 12 G96,yepi already tried playing genshin and so farit is smooth in gameplay with medium graphics are the graphics ok like hd

Infinix,Note 12 G96,any bootloop or deadboot issue
Infinix,Note 12 G96,upon using this phone for months can say that the build quality is decent the camera is quite good especially for its price although the video does not have eis the quality is still decent as for performance id say it is pretty good you can play genshin on medium and maintain frame rate gameplay likewise with honkai impact mobile legends run well on high and maintains stable frame rate along with lol wild rift for gaming this is great phone and for general everyday stuff its pretty good
Infinix,Note 12 G96,sorry you cant note is using virtual gyro sensor not based on hardware so the delay more does it work smoothly with videos
Infinix,Note 12 G96,turn off gestures nothing happen its stil stopping
Infinix,Note 12 G96,no high refresh rate

Infinix,Note 12 G96,im insanely deep in love with this spectacular smartphone recommend to everyone whos looking for reliable very fast and slick mobile
Infinix,Note 12 G96,if anyone is wondering the gyroscope is actually virtual so if you like to use gyro with your games just dont is anyone having some wifi problems if you dont turn xarena on sometimes it lags even though the internet is good and it only happens with this device have other smartphones and theyre not having the same issue its noticeable while playing games
Infinix,Note 12 G96,no terrible in terms of recording when you use their built in record sometimes the audio cuts off and you cant hear anything while recording after that when you play the video that you recorded theres no audio also terrible no sensor scam even if theres text in the box says that it has sensor its very delayed its not on the processor cuz have low processor and it runs very well in gyroscope no delay no dont even think the other cameras are really working cuz its only the top camera works did some research on what those cameras are no resolution fps camera the camera only allows you to record pfps fps kfps literally no fps even at no pubg not even good at pubg gyroscope delay swiping is bit delay its around fps idk why but maybe they mostly rely on gpu than cpu
Infinix,Note 12 G96,please who is better this infinix note or poco mpro infinix note

Infinix,Note 12 G96,gyro is deley lmao
Infinix,Note 12 G96,yes of course nice for
Infinix,Note 12 G96,dont be hater the issues you mentioned may not be encountered by others so stop telli more agree bought this phone and so far its awesome
Infinix,Note 12 G96,infinix phones are best in performance design everything but not buy infinix note gb more think its due to the ten layer graphene heat dissipation inside it pumping the heat inside it to the outside of the phone
Infinix,Note 12 G96,bought it yesterday at many things seems nice but it has horrible sound quality while more totally agree infinix really should focus on mic quality on all phones and other audio like noise cancellation mic and stereo recording redmi note have pro mic quality it can even record stereo audio in videos like iphone if infinix add or mics with at least bit audio will switch back to infinix phones the conclution for now its not the best one to get high value smartphone compare to it price
Infinix,Note 12 G96,no hz most of new release midrange phone have hz display it is budget phone
Infinix,Note 12 G96,why my ldac headphone is not supporting on this phone audio video got stuck phone hangs while bluetooth ldac supported headphone is connected the sound quality over bluetooth is very very bad any solution
Infinix,Note 12 G96,my gyroscope is working with delay any solution or have to visit claim center gyro is software no actual hadrware so delay is normal
Infinix,Note 12 G96,the low price and the long list of reliable specs adds to the appeal of the mediatek powered note turbo
Infinix,Note 12 G96,seems like you have never used any infinix phone at least watch review on youtube dont be hater the issues you mentioned may not be encountered by others so stop telling bad things about the phone in general
Infinix,Note 12 G96,amoled hz hz or hz
Infinix,Note 12 G96,disagree with you seems like you have never used any infinix phone at least watch review on youtube
Infinix,Note 12 G96,very bad user experience phones get really slow after week or two of usage there are no up more disagree with you
Infinix,Note 12 G96,is this brand good what wre the pros and cons its very good brand just that they produce middle and low end phones
Infinix,Note 12 G96,should buy infinix or not infinix phones are best in performance design everything but not buy infinix note gb chipset it has heating issues with normal use
Infinix,Note 12 G96,gb still needed sd card lol yes still need an sd card because download lot of music files in flac quality much bigger than mp know its stupid but its me lol
Infinix,Note 12 G96,thanks but no need for that still own xiaomi mi note pro it has gb with gb ra more gb still needed sd card
Infinix,Note 12 G96,why infinix sticks to helio series they have to use snapdragon in new phones
Infinix,Note 12 G96,if youre okay with lcd and its hz too go with note in some market its even onl more thanks but no need for that still own xiaomi mi note pro it has gb with gb ram but made mistake since it doesnt support an sd card slot wish didnt buy it
Infinix,Note 12 G96,very very poor but considering the price range its fair but expected more from this phone however lets see how pro goes

Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,brought lnfinix pro camera quality is not good mp camera not like less than cam more want to buy infinix phone so which one is better between this new product please help me
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,id say wouldnt recommend this phone because of its camera lens this phone would be better if theyd just used an ultrawide lens rather than macro and depth since heck dont think the buyer would ever use those lenses very often they would just use the main lens so its better to look for phone with an ultrawide lens if youre planning to buy phone with triple camera setup
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,found in it all the great specifications needed except nfc support dont know why more human beings are hard to please are the phone manufacturer even if they put all the specs you want inside the phone will still complain about one thing or the otherso stop giving negative comments about the phone
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,like infinix because of the huge screen size now they seem to be going back to more better still screen
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,omg that mp cameras is unnecessary or maybe useless its only there for looks just more it is bokeh lens
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,that very good phone for alli bought where did you buy it
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,you speak non sense let me know which phone is better off
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,total wastage of money number of times it freezes and restart this causes loss of workdisco more you speak non sense
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,infinix has another note pro recently released gsmarena check their website and review the phone once you lay your hands on it
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,dissapointment in my opinionthey could have gone with better processor even the dimensity would have been bettertheres like almost no difference bw the version and this one the only difference is connectivity and greater battery life
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,whats nfc near field communication its being used to buy and pay something with phone
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,the doesnt have nfc though while the regular pro does whats nfc
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,guys what do you think im bit confused here between this note pro and zero more pro is better
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,zero does not come with an amoled displaynote has higher ppiif you are an gamer you shoul more please bought infinix zero and android version can it carry current app
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,of course zero is much better the doesnt have nfc though while the regular pro does
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,how can phone be called pro without ois
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,after the new update my phone speakers are not working properly and nd sometimes mble phone shutdown himself like dead after pressing power button for minutes it restarts again
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,just want normal phone like infinix note pro with same design and specs helio and mpmp ultrawide depth with same price euros but plz make screen amoled because screen is better for me and for phone and overall for battery

Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,more than euro for phone with single band wifi what joke but in the price part its euro
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,stop using mp camera and put optical zoom lens instead and ultawide mp and add noise cancellation mic thats all infinix need to do
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,will consider if and nfc recommend you buying the vip version then as it has gb with gb ram and nfc
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,its very difficult to say because we know nothing of what your budget is and what you pr more bruh read the news this phone was only usd gsmarena clearly did not fix the price in specification yet
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,for anyone who dont know infinix save your money and dont buy their devices th more well paying euros for phone worth maybe is definitely trap this beauty does much more tricks for euros httpswwwgsmarenacomxiaomiredminoteprophp
Infinix,Note 12 Pro 5G,from my friend his worst experience was infinix

Infinix,Note 12 Pro,will this note pro get android ver
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,most people say that they dont give software updates but rather security patches only is that more yeah varies with the device recieves android security patches which is nice with no major changes to be applied like android version upgrades sometimes the update bring small fixes to the os when there is fixable hardware issue
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,this phone use ufs or emmc it uses ufs not emmc httpdeviceinfohwrudevicesitemphpitem
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,got good new peeps it is expendable upto tb lmao what chonker dey play it only expandable to gb so pls you keyboard warrior should quit lying
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,ui is too laggy worst part no update have to restart my phone twice day
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,thats bummer will consider infinix once they start giving os updates they are dead on updates that can even sign you on paper lmao
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,gb ram gb storagerom why reply when you dont understand what said
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,does infinix give os updates like xiaomi and realme dont think so use infinix last updated sap
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,infinix note gbram is sold at what price
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,this phone look fantastic for its price what the fck are you even talking about wooow thats awesome affordable phone for middle class family
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,well based on previous phone this should be atleast tb hope so
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,why it has qvga camera no plastic back no dont buy this phone this phone look fantastic for its price what the fck are you even talking about
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,huh infinix really put waterdrop notch on its phone released in rather than hole punch either they have huge stockpile of the display panels and theyre only getting rid of them or they bought this particular panel model at bargain price
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,yes its the truth seriously your not the only one im disappointed as well what are you talking about didnt even know what is compass
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,is this really doesnt support compass
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,what to ask what is the price difference between mp camera with ois and alot of options and normal flat mp camera why no one want to use these types of cameras at least eis
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,just add hz refresh rate and network in the same price now thats kinda asking for to much knowing its infinix who we are talking about
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,infinix really has to work on their front cameras
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,it has mp camera but it cant capture video this must be joke also redmi note pro and realme
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,front camera only mega pixel vivo is upgraded with mega pixel on front side so sad of infinix
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,anybody wants to give out their phones you can dash out to me then have no words for you
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,reasons disappointing me about this phone st is this phone doesnt support compass more as gamer was going to buy note vip but stopped and waited for this to launch kinda disappointed
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,why is gpu degraded in this one when gpu in infinix note pro was mali mc
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,one thing want to say to infinix before releasing is to add noise cancellation mic focus more you forgot to say we need eis for primary camera as well it work with software or ois if possible to keep price
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,killer phone for the money and the first in this price range with gb memory by default you cant see that even in much costly models too they are not sold in my country
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,they just choose the old instead dont be fool by the numbering of helio series just lo more bro the had mali eemc which is on par with mali mpwhich is supposedly superior to the latter the mali mc is equal to mali if it had less coremc well not in terms of raw power but in efficiency and performance per watt please refrain from spreading further misinformation
Infinix,Note 12 Pro,hahahuntill now the phone is not released how can degrade befor use

Infinix,Note 12,bro how many available storage in gb varient available storage hiw many around gb available
Infinix,Note 12,the competitor that will send infinix packing from africa market is xiaomi xiaomi gives after purchase service including android update while infinix phones get stock to the android version you bought with the phone with only security update xiaomi note phones already have android update miui buy xioami phones and get premium benefit for your money
Infinix,Note 12,just by xiaomi redmi note phone and be free note or
Infinix,Note 12,does the infinix note include google service yes
Infinix,Note 12,good quality the phone is good
Infinix,Note 12,mediatek claim that helio processors can stream full hd movies but phone manufacturers must secure widevine certification from google on the device note is loaded with only certification security level which makes it unable to stream full hd contents why did infinix fail to load certification on this device when they claim it is full hd device and cant stream full hd without certificate download drm from playstore to confirm this
Infinix,Note 12,nfc not available for indonesia sku
Infinix,Note 12,great features and very fast very good one infinix note is great
Infinix,Note 12,my new infinix note is restarting on its own
Infinix,Note 12,the xos may need lot self customisation if you are coming from other platformamoled screen needs screen protector as it has gorilla glass onlyoverall decent buy only the alarm sound not loudvery unlike ringtone otherbut have app for thatid add the signal strength is surprisingly good
Infinix,Note 12,mediatek helio no thanks
Infinix,Note 12,note sar is better than note
Infinix,Note 12,just dont fall for any negative comments remember its budget phone the only negative found out is the absence of active noise cancelation mic other than that the phone is perfect the best display outstanding battery backup great gaming performance great cameras overall the phone is fantastic one more thing it has got fast charger which charges your phones mah battery from zero to hundred in just hour minutes what more do you want just go for it
Infinix,Note 12,bukunmi aug pls dont buy this phone it does not support full hd streaming the drm certification on more wat happen with the phone that said they shouldnt buy it
Infinix,Note 12,pls dont buy this phone it does not support full hd streaming the drm certification on it is and not that is required and allowed on streaming platforms for full hd streaming buy the edition am not happy buying this phone better sacrifice for the edition or switch to other brands like xiaomi thank you infinix actually lied on this version the phone architecture is purely note packaged with note design casing login to facebook nd facebook indicated logins with infinix note also go and check infinix note you will realize the phone is perfectly same specification with note
Infinix,Note 12,for dual app option you should look for xiaomi phone dual app for whatsapp instagram facebook and messenger is default available on the device
Infinix,Note 12,most of the the issues raised below are addressed in settings the only thing find not okay is inability to have active noise cancelation mic infinix as produced two updates for this device which have updated the gesture pattern is different from previous gesture of fingers for navigation the phone is cool and value for the money dont forget it is mid range phone and probably one of the cheapest in market with this specification infinix fail to load android on this gadget to sell their variant which is more expensive with different in nigeria it have nfc hardware infinix should be producing android os update for their gadgets and not just the security updates or issue resolve updates alone
Infinix,Note 12,screen resolution is very nice colour full
Infinix,Note 12,dual speakers option is nice good bass and best for pubg
Infinix,Note 12,dont buy it it is terrible too much ads even in music player dont have app twine option more yes it is terrible it dont have option of app twine it dont show what msg notification untill open the app last day received whatapp call phone vibrating but not showing who is calling
Infinix,Note 12,bought it yesterday many things seems nice but it has horrible sound quality while using earphone nobody here said it before me and the teardrop notch really bothersome otherwise good has good touch response good displayetc
Infinix,Note 12,if only it use punch hole rather than teardrop notch
Infinix,Note 12,amoled is trademark of samsung so of course samsung lol no amoled is type of oled tech many companies are also developing it tianma lg boe visionox but samsung did improved this tech which they called super amoled which has their trademark
Infinix,Note 12,pls is there infinix note got one and am having feeling that its not genuine thanks dont know the phone to buy infinix what pls advise should go for note or
Infinix,Note 12,infinix note touch problem best mobile phone for gaming and long time charge backups love it note
Infinix,Note 12,anyone knows whos the amoled provider of this model amoled is trademark of samsung so of course samsung
Infinix,Note 12,just got the infinix note and believe its nice phone however the no no for me is that it does not include gestures to go back that is exist page to previous page which means you cant operate the phone with one hand also dont understand why manufacturers are mounting the thumbprint to the side it also means you cant effectively operate your phone with one hand hope they add the back gestures soon
Infinix,Note 12,the big display is good addition and consumers can play some interesting games seamlessly with the mediatek processor as well
Infinix,Note 12,if any of you want to buy infinix phone avoid note series since those offer nothing from more if want do video call for night the light on my phone note infinix
Infinix,Note 12,its exactly the same as infinix note there is no difference at all in fact saw youtube video this phone was clearly over heating alot performance has to be sorted out at first priority
Infinix,Note 12,infinix is too bad when it comes to updates there have massive lags in performance not good experience while using infinix phones
Infinix,Note 12,infinix has better signal strenght thx info im think to buy for my dad because old one got drop in the road
Infinix,Note 12,wth is nm chip still doing in
Infinix,Note 12,amoled on helio soc plus the poor software optimization that infinix has always had dont expect much but then again at that price who does
Infinix,Note 12,got to know that the note is geniue it comes with soc and its got hz refresh more its your choice amoled hz or ips with hz
Infinix,Note 12,well first of all the water drop display is really red flag here mean even the note has much more premium look we are in we expect the latest devices released by infinix to run on android or later
Infinix,Note 12,wish they upgrade chip on infinix series at least nm will wait for note pro pls is there infinix note got one and am having feeling that its not genuine thanks
Infinix,Note 12,in they cant manufacture phone of this series with android preinstalled cmon
Infinix,Note 12,specs and design identical to note they just added more color option disappointing not identical theyre the same thing plus the con of punch hole camera looks like the person who suggested the design of the device smoked weed and began to think back in time
Infinix,Note 12,this phone at eur charges faster than literally any samsung phone ever made that says more tf are you talking about its
Infinix,Note 12,why bring back the waterdrop notch now dont get it the last three generations of infinix note have been using the hole punch this is going backwards in terms of styling
Infinix,Note 12,baba it is euro not they made mistake
Infinix,Note 12,omg euro amoled screen phone aanyone wake me this is not funny
Infinix,Note 12,where is the difference between note and note its stil hz or hz refresh rate more note and has only android version difference nothing special
Infinix,Note 12,rather go for tecno camon that has hz gb ram helio with the same price as note which lacks atleast hz would be ok for us why would infinix repeat its self with note being the same as note
Infinix,Note 12,wat fast charging liked the most this feature its really awesome thanks to infinix
Infinix,Note 12,this features liked the mostits awesome
Infinix,Note 12,this type of design always remind me the xiaomi design makes sense but the thing is the note has the same design as the note which came out way before the xiaomi
Infinix,Note 12,let them try to use stronger chips stronger than this at eur how
Infinix,Note 12,true but going from nit amoled to nit amoled and offering it for eur is insan more agree fantastic brightness for such low price tag it overall looks more than decent for the price very good value
Infinix,Note 12,amazing deal for this price tag go infinix go
Infinix,Note 12,this is incredible value for eur
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,doesnt this phone work in the usa just landed in ny and no network even on us line keep lying to yourself
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,any heating issue the chipset in this is rather concerning would like to hear any experience with this device
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,the charging speed is impressive but mp is total joke something mp rear camera will defeat
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,loved itso perfect mobileminimal charging time too
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,no problem with facebook app good company xiaomi more mui faults guess this is the perfect infinix gb ram and mah but im little curios abt the camera mp infinix dont gt good cam
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,say that would be cool phone with gaming cause gigabytes of rams it could be more then high graphics
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,while im on call the touch screen is so sensitive to any touch my face touches for instance mute or pause or somehow it starts call with someone really dont want to call once was using viber calling app talking to important client when the whole phone just suddenly switched off solution use my infinix note vip just on speaker mode and never put it on my ear even though its brand new phone

Infinix,Note 12 VIP,im stl using huaweis flagship huawei pit has mali mp better than infinix not vip mam mc

Infinix,Note 12 VIP,just wanted nfinix note vp version agree this smartphone is perfect if this phone have
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,if this vip have will buy it
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,thats gb not gb thanks
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,the best infinix design and build quality phone specially the motherboard
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,people going crazy on infinix note vip cuz it goes above and here am on my infinix playing games at
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,mohsenrp jun xiaomi pro heating issue while playing pubg or genshin impact
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,then create your own smartphone wish could bro with could
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,was gona buy poco which have snapdragon but am deciding to buy this phone with helio cuz it have dedicated sim slot headphone jack either way sacrifice sd card and headphone jack or sacrifice gaming experience pretty much have options first option get poco bad part no headphone jack no sd card good part processor is snapdragon which is good for gaming exactly what need in my life full of lag second option get infinix note vip bad part not that good for gaming at that price point its more like scam good part does have headphone jack and it have dedicated sim slot this is one of those the test is not that hard the test moment that am in
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,how much zoom
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,when is infinix going to upgrade is fingerprintthey should stop this side mouthed scanner rat more in my opinion they should have made finger print under display front camera mp super amoled and the vip writeup at the back should have been made with cool blue light the infinix note vip would have been truely vip
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,just heard infinix phone from co worker here in the island and it amazed me she was able to do videocall when theres no signal in the area even iphone pro max user was amazed how infinix can capture so much signals will get myself one its very useful esp in areas with not much signalnetwork
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,infinix made mistake why not water resistant not even ip
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,the phone feature every good its deserve but demanding high capacity of mah battery than this osogbethefirst
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,vip the only thing vip about that is the price what about the fast charging how many phone can charge this fast is that not vip be objective
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,no screen protection
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,couldve been more better if they used the dimensity on it but if it has good gaming stability im okay with it
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,many models of tecno used one speaker while infinix two speakers stereo yes
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,if stable why update look to xiaomi not stable for mid or low price many updates without benefit lol updates was meant to increase security and can used app properly new apps or new updates for apps sometimes cant run on older android version even samsung and apple was very proud with their long term software updates and every user feel more save with more updates without changing to new device and see for upcoming years no one want to use android phone when there is already android if ure thinking buying cheap phone and dont care about the updates then ure poor fella without money
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,what about all the bloatware that comes with infinix and techno mobiles hope this one doesnt all that bloatware is really annoying
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,why not amoled sad its ambled
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,what fo you mean its amoled it means that the screen is as strong as original samsung screens and the graphics will be dope but also expensive to replace
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,infinix never better that way love tecno always the best many models of tecno used one speaker while infinix two speakers stereo
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,all have done beautiful but my suggestion is in this model or edition in new model note vi more this is so accurate
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,mah only what about speakers test
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,because sd cost is higher than media tek that is why their phones are cheap price but do not more joke of the era
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,this phone should have had dimensity and inch screen
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,infnix good phone but size inch to is good
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,infinix still sticks to helio series why they dont use snapdragon because sd cost is higher than media tek that is why their phones are cheap price but do not underestimate mediatek series it is really fast and reliable
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,im waiting impatiently for this monster
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,what if there is vip pro need it
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,note not available in pakistan why which infinix series available in your country avoid series since they offer little upgrade and higher price and avoid series too since they launch on older os
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,if this is atleast snapdragon or dimensity it would have been better story the more infinix still sticks to helio series why they dont use snapdragon
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,imagine the price if it launch in indo just buy note with same only rp jt more note not available in pakistan why
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,inch amoled screen bit display billion color expandable storage mm jack is more imagine the price if it launch in indo just buy note with same only rp jt amazing for playing video games great battery life and smooth ui with no ads
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,we need phone that will charge to in minutes we need minutes so we know its minutes
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,im anxiously waiting for infinix note anything short of that ill rather ke more what note redmi
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,flop because of processor never because of watt fast charging
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,supported pleaseeeee whats that
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,would have been great phone if they didnt use the helio cpu
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,infinix should just release version of this phone with different processor
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,this phone became flagship killerno waygot to improve the processoryou cant just pa more what if there is vip pro
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,my note pro is still doing great was hoping to upgrade to the vip but is turn off the in my note pro is fine works great does bit of gaming too but in is no waiting for the redmi note series now
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,eur for the helio am laughing rn omg so expensive for budget soc because the quality of display and fast charger very rare to see mp uwcamera at this price
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,lol they has too many helio series left
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,if the processor could be improved maybe snapdragon chipset the phone could be amazing
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,the battery should improve more and cheapset is too slow please change the processer helio it is not good processor
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,interesting but weird phone
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,its vip set its must be have gb ram gb its not go with this the battery its should be have other wise every think is very nice bt vip is vip ram battery plz impore
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,vip puts godawful helio in it infinix and tecno are both the same with their bs slow helio socs gsmarena should just label them both as transsion phones because thats what they are the parent company of infinix and tecno absolutely no different
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,best if battery mah and chipset
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,in terms of ram and the processor the price should be lowered this is just regular midrange phone
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,awaiting review
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,so infinix has such good display tech and didnt put it on the zero totally crazy
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,lol its just regular mid range with funny name
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,nice budget phone but only gb ram is grotesque error
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,the only downfall of this phone is the chipset why infinix is it compulsory to use this chip mediatek
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,mm or mp mp
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,it definitely has gb version as well
Infinix,Note 12 VIP,what will be the price of it in india and bangladesh
Infinix,Note 12i 2022,available until february
Infinix,Note 12i 2022,firsti used this phone very good no issues dont think about negative commentsyou will regret love buy this phone
Infinix,Note 12i,fingerprint option not showing my fingerprint sensor does not show
Infinix,Note 12i,pls can play ff or pubg game on this phone why yes
Infinix,Note 12i,is the fingerprint of this phone working most infinix note phones has fingerprint issues
Infinix,Note 12i,yes absolutely true after usage for more than year can say the phone is totally trash more delete unwanted files from your phone
Infinix,Note 12i,the only letdown on this phone is the audio quality dont know if it can be fixed yes initially when got it back then the audio quality was very bad but they later released an update and it fixed the issue to an extent
Infinix,Note 12i,my fingers print is not working mine is showing fingerprint hardware not available unless restart my phone before it will start working ive been using it for more than year and ive used up to storage
Infinix,Note 12i,my infinix note fingerprint option is not showing in the settings what is the problem am very interested about this phone
Infinix,Note 12i,the finger prints have been cut off from the panel my fingers print is not working
Infinix,Note 12i,all the app on my phone is not working is showing app not installed and used it last night
Infinix,Note 12i,very fantastic and easy to use and has its price is legislated
Infinix,Note 12i,im gamer for lifefor this phoneit can only play good at stable network and at fp more hpwuch did you buy it
Infinix,Note 12i,it laggs when playing pubg mobile and the max graphics is ultra dont buy if you play pubg my friend plays codm and ff with some games and it has no problems
Infinix,Note 12i,my phone gets hot when am charging it and it cant play netflix use gb ram by not using adjustable ramsitll work
Infinix,Note 12i,good in efootballgives the best in fps and low seriously broit does not lag lag
Infinix,Note 12i,the speakers in that phone are pathetic
Infinix,Note 12i,dj may honestly love everything about this phone since the first day bought it about month ago more ave got the phone as wellits nice phone but hizi dual speakers are of very poor qualityindeed poor
Infinix,Note 12i,honestly love everything about this phone since the first day bought it about month ago my only regret is the poor sound quality when listening to music hope it can be fixed
Infinix,Note 12i,cant split screen thats lie you press the downward arrow in front of an app icon in recent apps and you see the split screen option in an app that supports it
Infinix,Note 12i,all my apps stopped working when click on an app get app not installed erro more yes its frustrating
Infinix,Note 12i,ive always loved infinix product at point tried tecno product but really regretted it because it was just hanging and it made me so uncomfortable now im back to using infinix note and so far the experience has been just wow infinix never disappoints
Infinix,Note 12i,recommend infinix notei it serve me better than every phone used before the phone is good
Infinix,Note 12i,was enjoying this phone until this minute it says finger print no longer available dont understand
Infinix,Note 12i,everything about this phone is cool except for the audio quality so annoying hope an update can fix this
Infinix,Note 12i,dammy dammy you have it all wrong ive had it for month and the battery lasts days in activity and up to days when dont use it too much
Infinix,Note 12i,everything other thing is okay but the audio quality is bad cant record my drum videos more how about the battery capacity
Infinix,Note 12i,thank you very much note is way better are you sure
Infinix,Note 12i,infinix you should increase on front camers
Infinix,Note 12i,note is better what do you meanin what way
Infinix,Note 12i,the phone dont have battery at all
Infinix,Note 12i,facepalm lots of youtubers dont receive faulty unit by the manufactueres or do not more most youtubers buy their own version of the phone after they received one and wasnt even talking about that mkbhd made video about the note having the battery issue that made it blow up even though it never actually happened to him
Infinix,Note 12i,should you be doubtful or skeptical with certain brands than dont buy it no one is forcing you to do so with or without you the manufacturers still make billions annually
Infinix,Note 12i,wish can get away with it because they arent the ones making the phones and false advert more facepalm lots of youtubers dont receive faulty unit by the manufactueres or do not get enough time with the phone to find out the issues also mione has its own website and sells its own brand phones which has the same mistakes as wish am pretty sure many more exist but we just do not know about them
Infinix,Note 12i,again the same way no one sued the brutally ripped off design and name forgetting the false more wish can get away with it because they arent the ones making the phones and false advertisements do get taken off but the same company under different name reuploads them anyway ill believe this when see bigger articleyoutuber covering that they really have viruses
Infinix,Note 12i,if it really is true why has nobody sued them before again the same way no one sued the brutally ripped off design and name forgetting the false specs on with other brands we had something related to xiaomi phone roots called mione if you did not hold it youd think its owner is using iphone until you touch it or look at the logo then you know it is cheap replica from distance no way you would tell
Infinix,Note 12i,you really ask about something legal with chinese company besides wasnt the one more why believe them dont believe any of this sorry yeah im asking know they wouldnt care in china but these phones arent china only surely they wouldnt get away with it outside of china
Infinix,Note 12i,like trojan or what if so how would that be legal if they have that so obviusly you really ask about something legal with chinese company besides wasnt the one who claimed they had viruses the users did on some model pages
Infinix,Note 12i,no they do not spy they straight up have viruses meaning risk of data theft like trojan or what if so how would that be legal if they have that so obviusly
Infinix,Note 12i,who cares lol google and meta and basically every company knows everything about us if infin more no they do not spy they straight up have viruses meaning risk of data theft
Infinix,Note 12i,mean it is infinix you could be at risk with your data while you dont even know it who cares lol google and meta and basically every company knows everything about us if infinix wants to spy on me how much time im spending on gsmarena and how much money spend on collectible phones then go ahaed
Infinix,Note 12i,got the note and have been using it for over two weeks now the phone is great pretty fas more mean it is infinix you could be at risk with your data while you dont even know it
Infinix,Note 12i,they still include qgva sensor in their new phones so hilarious still much better than brands claiming that they have actually functional cameras but then some end up being piece of plastic this one is at least real sensor but with no function pretty much there for decoration
Infinix,Note 12i,prices varies so much ive seen huuge differences in prices for the same device depending where the phone is sold india pakistan nigeria africa or other country price difference can be eur for eur phone
Infinix,Note 12i,okay at this point the regular note price has to be wrong thats way better than this in every way and it is eur cheaper
Infinix,Note 30 5G,same issue did find the solution me to lol

Infinix,Note 30 5G,currently using it right now for week and still doesnt having any major issue other than the simultaneous tap in game while playing codm the character will suddenly stops that ending up getting killed after the two os updates
Infinix,Note 30 5G,what say designer of infinix note why he didnt put gorilla glass for screen pr more just install tempered glass on it simple solution to your simple problem duhh
Infinix,Note 30 5G,actually this device called infinix note is great phone with huge storage ram an more just put tempered glass simple solution to your simple problem duhh
Infinix,Note 30 5G,recently upgraded from hot nfc to this phone heres what got to say after week of usage performance is quite decent in games was able to play genshin impact with med to high disabled shadows graphics quite well the battery actually lasts long taking hours of usage before it runs out the dual speakers sound quality and loudness is great compared to my previous phone hot nfc where it had good quality but the noiseloudness was just lownot loud enough for me camera is kinda meh for me as really dont take pictures as am more into gaming but it has great quality both pictures and videos as for the features what really liked is the bypass charging rest was kinda okay for me what disliked about this phone is that they didnt state if the phone has corning gorilla glass or any protection and the amount of preinstalledbloatware apps
Infinix,Note 30 5G,no support for hdmi alt mode sad
Infinix,Note 30 5G,would be sad if it sold out after october

Infinix,Note 30 5G,think im okay with this phone in every aspect oneplus we provide triple cameras in dots infinix we provide double cameras in dots unique lol
Infinix,Note 30 5G,good phone with reasonable price
Infinix,Note 30 5G,pethatic mobile everything is fake starting from cpu to the camera just download antutu and se more now it may be true that it shows on antutu that is uses dimensity it is disproven by the system settings and the camera is mp by default if you use your eyes you can see at the top and lastly fix your grammar you year old
Infinix,Note 30 5G,som extende ips display is good since amoled is plagued with green line issue bought this mobile to use dedicated hotspot
Infinix,Note 30 5G,good to see ips lcd amoled gives me headache so am going to switch back to lcd hope more more prefer ips lcd over amoled for now my lcd phones oppo infinix note are just brighter and easier on the eyes while the amoled ones oppo reno were difficult to see in daylight and just generally dim unless you ramp up the brightness which just consumes more power for this reason dont watch netflix on amoled screen
Infinix,Note 30 5G,props for bypass charging all phones should come with that especially the flagships and the gaming phones will extend your battery life so much sadly this chipset is weak for any gaming
Infinix,Note 30 5G,same as processor oh no not that again
Infinix,Note 30 5G,why in africa overpriced simple answergreed
Infinix,Note 30 5G,how many ca

Infinix,Note 30 5G,love infinix
Infinix,Note 30 5G,amoled screen is good for those who have poor eyesight but for me prefer lcd my vision more also have vision but the glowing orb of an lcd is just so irritating to my eyes to to be fair am using lcd screens for my pcs and such because of how pricey oled monitors are
Infinix,Note 30 5G,it is value for money phone if coming price yes it is value for money love infnix phones
Infinix,Note 30 5G,infinix note value for money phone if coming at upto price
Infinix,Note 30 5G,please put ultrawide camera to all the upcoming unit of infinix put radio and headset input thank you so much
Infinix,Note 30 5G,my current daily driver is the redmi note pro and guess what it has an amoled screen more amoled screen is good for those who have poor eyesight but for me prefer lcd my vision is got tested while renewed my drivers license
Infinix,Note 30 5G,mr simpletech guy jun they dont mention it because gorilla glass is common to all smartphones is it girilla glass also
Infinix,Note 30 5G,no gorilla glass good luck with slight drop lol they dont mention it because gorilla glass is common to all smartphones
Infinix,Note 30 5G,you must be changing phones often that you never see the cursed burnin from amoleds heck us more my current daily driver is the redmi note pro and guess what it has an amoled screen ive been using this phone since its launch and havent experienced any issues with screen burnin yet oh and dont change phones often my last phone was the oppo from and the reason switched to the rnpro was that the oppo decided to brick itself but either way would rather experience the benefits of brighter and more beautiful screen at hz than stare at an lcd at hz any day of the week sure burnins are inevitable but hey thats just how the game goes isnt it
Infinix,Note 30 5G,should be buying this phone know people say that the chipset is just the same as the old more you will not regret it this is good one
Infinix,Note 30 5G,the first time used infinix mobile and love it it is budget friendly yet the specs are awesome have note and have no issues also had note and hot phone and theyre all amazing
Infinix,Note 30 5G,bruhsaid may almost no difference with the infinix note pro dimensity is just dimensity lol mind you this is not the pro variant as the note pro once it releases it will probably use more powerful chipset than maybe or
Infinix,Note 30 5G,in the philippines price in pesos for gbgb variant and pesos for gbgb variant
Infinix,Note 30 5G,gonna buy this phone waiting for ful reviews
Infinix,Note 30 5G,guess am gonna bought this phone this phone is perfectly qualified for my range of budget
Infinix,Note 30 5G,an oledamoled display would have made this the best budget phone of the year
Infinix,Note 30 5G,almost no difference with the infinix note pro dimensity is just dimensity lol
Infinix,Note 30 5G,infinix just deceive their customers with useless numbers doing the same again with unnecessar more just think of the price its more on the budget side what do you expect in budget smart phone snapdragon th gen
Infinix,Note 30 5G,model number
Infinix,Note 30 5G,no for infinix no custom rom for mediatek
Infinix,Note 30 5G,up to gb extended ram charging via typec bypass mode dimensity chipset more camon premier is way better than this rubbish
Infinix,Note 30 5G,no what is going on inside your head from company like infinix is funny dream come fr more infinix delivered with note vip and it worked very well
Infinix,Note 30 5G,thoght this had charging but it says what is going on gsm arena no what is going on inside your head from company like infinix is funny dream come from not be well covered at night
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,fun fact this phone was originally supposed to launch as the note pro while the note was going to be the note there was also going to be note which dont think launched as anything
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,all goood but network problemmm
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,using this mobile for last year very good solid phone but from last week when call come in more thats not an issue its feature when you put your phone next to your ear some feature activate dont really mind it tho
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,have bad connection
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,dev jul hi am planing to buy this smarthone in serbia for eur its definatelly best buy more yup it will be good option
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,google playstore came installed in mobile from factory if you dont have google play store or google services installed then that means you have the chinese version of the device
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,where its still in pakistan
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,also bought phone in serbia and didnt get wireless charger why have no more hi am planing to buy this smarthone in serbia for eur its definatelly best buy how long do you use this phone and what about os optimisation is it ok for everyday use calls texting social media yt camera etc even without wirelles charger it seems to be great deal for this money think that in serbia they intentionally cell phone without wirelles charger so they can cell it separatelly
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,hello buy in serbia and didnt get wireless charger does anyone knows why they promo more also bought phone in serbia and didnt get wireless charger why have no idea but for this money never got more from phone from this manufacturer eur thats really ridiculous price for what this phone offers and what it offers
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,its updated to months ago where its still
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,ive just got one brand new out of the box it lags big time while scrolling basic thing more have been using this phone for about months now it doesnt lag the phone is awesome check if one got is original
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,overall good but no gcam support in the phone last update removed some needy feature like volume control with smart pannel
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,my battery is no longer last what may happen to it it drained fast do you do gaming or just basic use also do you have always internet on and several apps working in background they drain battery pretty fast also hz refresh rate drains battery faster so keep it at or if despite all this your battery health wont approve then may be your model is faulty
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,this phone no volte calling function support hopefully infinix technically revelant team will soft this issue soon
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,yes have received the android update today its gb update iv received android update gb installed it but iv noticed and want to know why is there an advertisement in calendar app
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,is it getting the anytime soon yes have received the android update today its gb update
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,ive using for years old todays his birthday and wish to trade this phone with note pro since it has better thermal efficiency and comes with wireless powerbank and charger ive borrowed my friends wireless power bank from his note and it worked quite useful in urgent situation remember that it worked as your backup just to keep the phone alive and charged in some minutes but thats better than
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,at least it can have up to gb ram
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,no hello how are you my question is that not pro dont any app vidmate
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,im not sure but ive tested efootball in home tempreature on max graphic with more finally someone efootball is quite demanding since update it toasts my poco ms quite good
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,would suggest you guys dont update the phone unless you want to face performance decrease its worth it to not update it nothing much changed but resources like its huge upgrade more downgrade than upgrade more hotter more battery drain more lags plus never let your fingerprint touch water
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,very good with its price range comes with screen protector jbl sound logo casing included bu more this is the review was looking for im heavy gamer efootball and wouldnt want heating issues but are there superamoled screens that dont heat up under heavy usage thinking of the phone could get within the price range of this note help
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,has it noice cancellation mic no
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,use the compare button dont know how to explain this but thinks the spec sheet is theoretical and there is but difference in personally using the phone thats why was asking here if anyone has used both of these phones or has experience with atleast one of them
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,honestly did not excepect thatits wonderfull device in everythingdisplaysoundbattery more the only disappointment is it doesnt have ultrawide camera
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,infinix note vs note pro which one should buy and why explain in detail with pros and cons use the compare button
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,unfortunately the phone is only widevine hopefully infinix would upgrade the software soon more is this phone still on wideiivine or has it been updated to
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,use from sep not bad at all
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,when xos with android seems infinix gonna stick with android on this
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,how many os updates will it receive tho and should wait for the note series all infinix phones are always lacking in updates software or security believe the note is for different market according to the rumors the price will be higher than note im using this phone for months and so far no major complains
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,bought phone months ago works smoothly charging once in few days all apk running fast sound is realy good video in hi res playing without stacks cameras ok during this period of time no complaining
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,its bad in gaming very bad in graphics
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,can you recommend me budget phone little better than this with the following points in min more moto
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,is netflix still lagging on this phone id like to know
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,thanks been reading lot of comment that sadid this is the worts phone they ever buy but more its not that good but like mine as secondary device for its relatively fast reverse wired charging and reverse wireless charging saves me from carrying battery pack
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,its still as of latest update october thanks been reading lot of comment that sadid this is the worts phone they ever buy but want this phone so much
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,can you multitask on infinix note pro
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,what would like to is that you post review of its capabilities after testing want more the phone is good for its price and not to talk of it coming with wireless charging pad in the box and it also has reverse wireless charging thats great right and the helio chip in it is good though for midrange phone same as the samsung which only comes with just the phone and the chord in the box this phone is great if you want to go for it id advice you to do that without hesitation anyone telling you this phone isnt good is just lying ps this phone comes with watt charger and watt wireless charger in the box all these for just less than dollars
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,how was this phone if it was used for heavy multitasking like chrome in the background with more should be fine once had pdf reader open with whatsapp and samsung internet in the background none of them reloads as also check gmail instagram and reddit in the meantime once also found that my search results on an online marketplace app is still open on the same page when returned to it days later sot is good easily hours if you dont run demanding applications struggle to really drain it to below on any given day lots of browsing reddit youtube and other social media apps during the day also connect the phone via bluetooth on my car to play music with yt music
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,would make sense to buy this phone only if it is within usd price range otherwise there is nothing about the note pro that holds any merit escpecially the overated helio which could hardy be any better than the basic old dimensity given the fact it doesnt even have

Infinix,Note 30 Pro,got infinix note pro last week for now the phone is awesome after one to two months of more does this phone have the option to record conversations without notifying the other party
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,infinix note vip isnt in stock infinix phones in pakistan are sold at higher price more recently bought infiniz note pro from akhtar plaza saddar rawalpindi for excellent phone totally value for money and in stock as well
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,wouldnt just cant id rather get the camon premier for its fla more infinix note vip isnt in stock infinix phones in pakistan are sold at higher price than the official launch the tecno camon premier is more expensive than the and could wait for redmi but dont know whats going on with the os changes the redmi note series may come out soon dont mind samsungs os maybe can wait for the next gen series
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,you mustve gotten bad unit cause mine doesnt lag obviusly if you are hea more would you recommend the samsung galaxy over the infinix zero for long term use the is about the infinix launches on october th of pakistan im going to wait to check the price and let you know dont like curved displays
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,after the updates the battery life is poor am getting hrs mins screen on time for to battery lapse this barely month old phone
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,have received it yes and so far so good but only buy this phone if its actually avail more sneak peek just launched on the infinix facebook page it just says launching soon ill update you when it launches and for how much family member bought for long term and its pretty good
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,rs thank you and what about note vip and zero prices im going to buy one of them
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,yeah its definitely out of budget the xiaomi it launches for pkr around more have received it yes and so far so good but only buy this phone if its actually available in your market otherwise you might run into some issues mostly just comment here however not reviewer sadly
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,there shouldnt be issues like that but dont have much experience with xiaomi ph more ill see if can find the budget for though would you still recommend it at that price usd what would you suggest in midrange around maybe up to usd range other than the infinix zero
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,im reading online on the xiaomi subreddit and lot of people are complaining about bloa more there shouldnt be issues like that but dont have much experience with xiaomi phones so it might be true and at the very least it sounds alarming id rather go with infinix
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,the would be the best choice but it all depends on price because that will surely be mor more im reading online on the xiaomi subreddit and lot of people are complaining about bloatware and apps automatically installing do you think ill have the same issue with the if bought it they also talk about downloading other roms but idk how you do that will the be cluttered with bloatware and bunch of ads
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,the im looking at currently are xiaomi depending on price launches tomorrow octo more the would be the best choice but it all depends on price because that will surely be more expensive than the zero if not go for it id choose the zero over the redmi note pro or pro tho
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,absolutely not that phone is extremely slow the zero has arrived to where live yes more the im looking at currently are xiaomi depending on price launches tomorrow october th in pakistan redmi note propro no idea when launch maybe near the start of infinix zero launches this month the thing with infinix is theres barely any stock so it sells for way more than its launch price would any of those choices be good what is your opinion on the
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,what would you recommend should wait for the infinix zero think you sh more did you get the infinix zero need help deciding what phone to get idk when redmi note series comes out but redmi note is available should buy that temporarily
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,bought days ago cheap but high quality it has all the necessary features she loves it
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,good futures

Infinix,Note 30 Pro,my friend is offering to sell his note pro at pretty low price and he only has used it fo more yes you should
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,still havent bought phone yet im waiting for something good to be released or more what would you recommend should wait for the infinix zero think you should but it depends on the price of that in your country just ordered the zero couple of days ago havent received it yet but will come back with my opinion on it after get it the note pro is still much better than the redmi note pro
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,think if you looking for phone uses for heavy gaming especially if your work in gaming indu more infinix note vip is actually the best phone ever used
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,also what are your opinions on bbk company phones are they safe to use oh abso more still havent bought phone yet im waiting for something good to be released or for prices to drop the xiaomi redmi note pro dropped in price but dont want to get that since its infinix note vip launches soon infinix zero maybe next month redmi launched redmi note is also here samsung galaxy aa are being sold for cheaper now have found trusted website that is selling the for about what would you recommend should wait for the infinix zero
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,hello just wanted to ask if this phone is good for heavy gaming because my work is around more think if you looking for phone uses for heavy gaming especially if your work in gaming industry isnt it best if you got the gaming phone that type of phone is made with speciality for gaming the gaming phone is more expensive tho than this but if you dont have problem with that think you need to look for gaming phone
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,heya all im looking for new phone after my previous one died poco rip and more well just gave one to my wife and so far so good for the team with the price that got it im from colombia and here is entering the brand well everything will say the time come redmi note that also seemed good team but xiaomi teams in colombia have become more expensive this brand is relatively new is giving better configurations and better price recommend it without any doubt the only thing that sin this team is that it has no wide angle camera otherwise it is very complete and efficient
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,screen protection is important
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,pro but not really make surprize ip amoled camera and fast charge chipset doesnt change
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,hello youtuber watch confirmed that tecno will also launch phantom series phone would more also what are your opinions on bbk company phones are they safe to use oh absolutely daily drive bbk phone the vivo note but wouldnt buy their cheaper than usd phones im sure those are safe too they just arent that great youtuber watch confirmed that tecno will also launch phantom series phone would you recommend that over the camon premier no it will likely be much more expensive and the camon premier is more than good enough
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,note pro or tecno camon premier if thats not lot more expensive hello youtuber watch confirmed that tecno will also launch phantom series phone would you recommend that over the camon premier also the redmi note pro isnt launching in pakistan infinix isnt being sold at the price it launched so thats no also what are your opinions on bbk company phones are they safe to use
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,pls house am confuse making choiceshould go for note pro or galaxy or redmi or techno only google pixel
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,ah okay it doesnt say anything on the gsmarena page what about the hz mode do you th more yap that should be an easy fix
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,wait the camon premier does come with preinstalled screen protector and has an ip rat more ah okay it doesnt say anything on the gsmarena page what about the hz mode do you think they will fix it with updates it doesnt work in gmail and some other apps
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,alright thanks for the help the thing im looking at is the tecno comes without any prot more wait the camon premier does come with preinstalled screen protector and has an ip rating it has slower processor but it should be fine for daily use of course it is fine but the camon premier is better
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,also how would you compare it to samsung aa how many updates well the more alright thanks for the help the thing im looking at is the tecno comes without any protection like ip rating etc and without screen protector also the review done by gsmarena shows that the hz refresh rate is bit buggy and works on some apps and doesnt on some maybe they will fix that with updates also it doesnt have hdrdolby vision the camera is good ive seen was wondering if should get the redmi note pro if that launches instead of the tecno as itll be bit cheaper it also comes with gorilla glass ip hdrdolby vision it has slower processor but it should be fine for daily use dont game on my phone thanks for the help so far
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,my budget is about usd do you have discord can contact you on or just through more imo infinix ui with no update and stock android is better than entrymidrange redmi phoneeven though dont know about their flagship phone infinix is real threat to all brand in the midrange level when speaking of value for money
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,alright ill wait for the camon premier reputable website posted that tecno will la more also how would you compare it to samsung aa how many updates well the thing is prefer anything over samsungs one ui so id obviusly that the tecno is better anyways when it comes to the parts that really matter so the chipset and the cameras the tecno is objectively much better their displays are similar but the tecno has less bezels you wont get many updates but dont think that matters as the best software your phone can have is the one its launched with is the phone safe any adsbloatware hows the display on it will it be safe to use banking apps etc it absolutely is safe have used tecno camon premier for couple of months and had my banking data on it payed with it too using google wallet and im currently doing the same with the infinix zero ultra which is phone from basically the same company so yeah they are both safe ads are no but there will be bloatware on it most you can just turn off or delete tho and the storage is huge so it shouldnt bother you
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,oh in that case wait for the camon premier that is much better than the redmi note pro more alright ill wait for the camon premier reputable website posted that tecno will launch it in early september is the phone safe any adsbloatware hows the display on it will it be safe to use banking apps etc thanks for the responses hows the sound quality also how would you compare it to samsung aa how many updates
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,not confirmed if they will launch the note pro in my country the tecno camon pro more oh in that case wait for the camon premier that is much better than the redmi note pro would like to get that as well but here its impossible so im staying with my infinix zero ultravivo note
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,hey the phone released in my country but its selling for more than the official price was more my budget is about usd do you have discord can contact you on or just through this gsmarena is fine do but rarely check it im here every day so just ask me here unofficially launched redmi note pro in my country but should wait for redmi note pro still do not buy the redmi note pro it comes with android wait for the version
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,if eur is too much for phone like this then what would you get for this much money hey the phone released in my country but its selling for more than the official price was the one who asked you about buying it and comparing it with the redmi note pro unofficially launched redmi note pro in my country but should wait for redmi note pro still my budget is about usd do you have discord can contact you on or just through this gsmarena is fine
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,note pro had two bigs problems like video storage path you cant choose to sd card storage second font custom disfunctional and lastly nes feed page setting is crash all the time
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,then dont know what speak of the note is lcd display charging whereas the more and even wireless charging and comes with wireless charger and has stereo speakers tuned by jbl yet its quite cheap dont get what the other comment was talking about
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,decided to wait and finally they restock it again but then heard gt pro will be in here too dont know when tho should wait again for that how much more budget do need didnt know the price for gt pro here rn have enough for the note pro
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,infinix infinix note pro just like note not specialand its too much costly
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,yes its called note vip meant gt pro with like better camera setup
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,wonder if the pro will ever even exist yes its called note vip
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,ok bludgl ur infinix updates spoiler alert there arent any nevermind th they are the th largest combined with tecno and itel so there is that httpsmgsmarenacomcanalysglobalsmartphoneshipmentdowninqtranssionisnowatopfivevendornewsphp oh and software updates are pointless if the phone isnt powerful enough so id rather take more hardware features than more software updates that will just make my phone slower
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,you didnt buy it yet you are calling it pos proves you have no idea what more ok bludgl ur infinix updates spoiler alert there arent any
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,in this price tag its not good phone because the camera is so cheap it gave you only more unrealistic expectations
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,is ir infinix note pro have motherboard issue like xiomi poco im overthinking to use any more infinix note pro have motherboard issue no it doesnt
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,if compare to vivo pro in what term this infinix more better pretty much everything but the camera better soc more storage bigger battery faster charging with wireless charging hz display and uptodate software its also years newer
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,different firmware or android skins can vary by manufacturers it wont be much different maybe we didnt even notice it in gaming gsmarena has already reviewed the note which is also the and got pretty good thermalthrottling
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,the gt pro is basically note vip in terms of chipset would like to see the lcd versi more wonder if the pro will ever even exist
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,realme also uses the and plays codm fps medium setting httpswwwyoutubecomwa more different firmware or android skins can vary by manufacturers
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,really like the phone but im contemplating whether to go for it or for galaxy more the gt pro is basically note vip in terms of chipset would like to see the lcd version for gt pro dont want amoled because dont want to spend half of the unit just to fix the display and would like to see what would the pro chipset have
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,infinix mean if they want camera style and software updates on infinix is rather questionable
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,if you care much about camera and software update go for infinix
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,deleted post if you care much about camera and software update go for
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,you can buy realme and vivo realme sure but has emmc vivo if price drops it might be decent one
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,please brother be making follow up commitment about the performance camera quality battery more really like the phone but im contemplating whether to go for it or for galaxy just go for the note pro it has significantly more features be making follow up commitment about the performance camera quality battery life and your general experience with this phone will so far so good when it comes to everything camera quality is good for the price im also likely going to buy the infinix gt pro and make follow ups on that
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,just received my first software update the june security patch please brother be making follow up commitment about the performance camera quality battery life and your general experience with this phone really like the phone but im contemplating whether to go for it or for galaxy
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,really digging this phone my only concern is if the helio can handle codm without lag more realme also uses the and plays codm fps medium setting httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvegarhpvcjli
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,brother know where are you from you should go for infinix note they both are coming more im not gamer but yeah im going for infinix because yea havent had good experience with redmi note phones many problems in modems and gps so yeah im gonna go for note pro
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,bro if youre also looking for another brands go for tecno camon pro it has awesome specifications for its price and as you looking it has good cameras too even for day to day usage or gaming its performance is more than enough whether it available in your country or not you can also go for other phones of tecno released this year dont consider theast years tecno phones please
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,one more question sorry for asking multiple so if the note pro plus releases take tha more one more question sorry for asking multiple ask as many questions as youd like so because of the cameras id choose the note vip over all of the mentioned phones but if you cant find that anymore then the redmi note pro is your best option its basically the same as the redmi note pro plus has much better chipset than said infinix phones and both redmi have good camera
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,if you can find it for about usd or less then you should if its more expensive just more one more question sorry for asking multiple so if the note pro plus releases take that over all of them what about the normal note pro that or the note pro note pro is launching officially on august nd dont know when the other phones will launch so thats why im not sure if should wait because it might be sold out and the other phones might not launch any time soon
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,well in that case you should just get redmi note pro plus which is about rs so more dont think its available here yet if it does release should buy it over the infinix think the redmi note pro might release not certain
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,pakistan well in that case you should just get redmi note pro plus which is about rs so about usd
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,anything worth it in xiaomisamsung etc xiaomi might be worth looking into sa more pakistan
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,any other phones should look for other than infinix anything worth it in xiaomisamsung et more anything worth it in xiaomisamsung etc xiaomi might be worth looking into samsung at these prices is definite no go also can disable the bloatware etc most of it you can yes which country are you at maybe can look at some good xiaomi deals at these prices
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,helio will feel slow or not nope its perfectly fine for regular more any other phones should look for other than infinix anything worth it in xiaomisamsung etc around the same price range dont care about gaming performance but would like decent camera tbh just good day to day performance without lag and good display or should just get the note pro sorry for asking multiple questions also can disable the bloatware etc
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,if possible should go for the note vip instead im not sure if its going to more helio will feel slow or not nope its perfectly fine for regular daily usage also how many updates wouldnt expect many unfortunatelly they did release the note vip in my country though in that case if they still sell that in your country then you should absolutely get that over any note series phone if the cameras are important for you if performance is more important then and only then go for the note vip but if you are looking for the most balanced option then that would be the note pro
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,how is this phone as daily driver dont game on my phone and will just use more if possible should go for the note vip instead im not sure if its going to be launched in my country or not the infinix website is only listing the normal the pro variant they did release the note vip in my country though so im expecting infinix to also release the vip maybe not now but soon im not sure if the helio will feel slow or not also how many updates the phone is launching for approximately usd is there any other options around this price range or if go up to thanks
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,anyone tell infinix provide google play store updates or not yeah they do have gsm
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,and did you meant miui is teriible than xos dont get it you misunde more understood
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,said to anyone who dont care about android updates and know that you have two infin more and did you meant miui is teriible than xos dont get it you misunderstood me miui isnt terrible or even bad prefer os over it but miui is good too neither of them are good when it comes to updates
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,are trying to say that providing android updates is not worthy or infinix is not pro more said to anyone who dont care about android updates and know that you have two infinix phones the zero ultra and note pro and did you meant miui is teriible than xos dont get it
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,are trying to say that providing android updates is not worthy or infinix is not providing more are trying to say that providing android updates is not worthy or infinix is not providing android updates to keep the phone speed neither what meant by that was that wouldnt trade good hardware for absolutely terrible hardware just to get updates on it and truly say if you dont care about the updates you can surely go for infinix phones already have check my comment on the infinix hot with the linked picture
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,how is this phone as daily driver dont game on my phone and will just use this fo more how is this phone as daily driver dont game on my phone and will just use this for normal daily use streamingchrome etc in that case its perfect is this phone secure yes it is used it to pay with google wallet they had some issues with tecno while back thats true but that was very long time ago
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,infinix doesnt have good track record for version updates either but that doesn more are trying to say that providing android updates is not worthy or infinix is not providing android updates to keep the phone speed im still looking for budget phone and fr also wanted to buy infinix phone infinix note that phone has everything superb that stereo speakers tuned by jbl bigger display charging gb storage connectivity only the software is keeping me back to buy the phone and truly say if you dont care about the updates you can surely go for infinix phones
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,software updates cant add hardware features which infinix has more of security updates more love you you know infinix very well strong and reliable forget about version updates
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,you are correct have infinix mobiles also which models have you got
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,xiaomi never had track record of updates and infinix is trustworthy what stupid thing more infinix doesnt have good track record for version updates either but that doesnt make them untrustworthy at all have infinix phones and never had issues with any of them one of those phones is this one btw why bother with software updates anyways they add nothing but slow down the phone
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,xos is not that trustable compared to miui which is important too xiaomi promises more xiaomi never had track record of updates and infinix is trustworthy what stupid thing to say my redmi power introduced in android and it is now android and still receives security updates while my friends infinix note is introduced with android and its still in android cant see trustworthy at all anyway sorry for the glass back
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,samsung galaxy vs infinix note pro which is best dudego for note pro its better than samsung need to open your mind and eyes to see the truth
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,good looking mob
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,but samsung will provide years android updates on and infinix no provide any update software updates cant add hardware features which infinix has more of security updates are more important which infinix does provide
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,the note pro is much better value it has an ip rating stereo speakers fast wirele more but samsung will provide years android updates on and infinix no provide any update
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,sorry meant redmi note not the but you say except the chipset everything is fine more xos is not that trustable compared to miui which is important too xiaomi promises years of android updates years of miui update and security patches it is completely trustable or rather trustworthy promise doesnt equal actually doing something and xiaomi never had good track record of updates note pro has glass back btw
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,aside from the soc everything about this phone is better than the already existing redmi note more sorry meant redmi note not the but you say except the chipset everything is fine in this note pro the note has larger display glass back mainly the sd gen but also has so many cons while compared to note pro the stereo speakers only the front camera hertz refresh rate the fast charging are not available in but you see xos is not that trustable compared to miui which is important too xiaomi promises years of android updates years of miui update and security patches and also note pro is nearly double prized which have only one year of android updates and years of security patches if youre gamer and confusing to choose choice between these two you can surely buy redmi note
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,had redmi note pro and truth is that infinix note is far betterit takes better photo more better camera ok buy then
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,people forgot when the internet was kb fast now its like in mebabytes and its more wifi is very slow compared to wifi
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,redmi upcoming aside from the soc everything about this phone is better than the already existing redmi note so no way that the redmi will be better than this
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,what kind of xiaomi then redmi upcoming
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,nope buy xiaomi product what kind of xiaomi then
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,should replace my poco with this phone im not sure about infinixs xos as more nope buy xiaomi product
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,bro infinix note vip is better because it has wifi it has faster connection in data and more people forgot when the internet was kb fast now its like in mebabytes and its still to slow dont be ridiculous
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,let me introduce to you the note vip which has dimensity that can have staggering more every infinix series on this year is crazy worth it but infinix doesnt gives any info about updating
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,im impressed by infinix im too and at this price point the note more bro infinix note vip is better because it has wifi it has faster connection in data and staggering antutu score unlike the pro version it only has and only stuck at wifi which is kinda slow in todays world lol
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,does this has noise canceling mic
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,anybody in malaysia here did this phone support volte and vowifi in malaysia if yes tell me which operator you did triedthanks
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,choose note for far more friendly budget bcs the specs doesnt really impact gaming performance cpu ram etc compared to the pro version the charging watt is the only one to brag about
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,indonesia well in that case the redmi note pro or if your budget allows it then the infinix zero ultra is my recommendation
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,there is nothing like this in my country in this price range but live in the eu hungary to more indonesia
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,yes tbh im interested with this phone but the official store didnt even know when more there is nothing like this in my country in this price range but live in the eu hungary to be exact which country do you live in maybe can find you something good
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,is it great phone why did you choose those two the note pro is much better than those worths the wait
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,too bad the phone is always out of stock already here please give me another phone recommenda more you can buy realme and vivo
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,ghost phone
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,those are still very pricey where where live an is about usd used of course
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,what phone would you recommend that has good camera quality that is also budget friendly would say the poco pro would be better as well as the processing power twice as fast for half the price
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,you could get an old flagship like samsung or google pixel those are still very pricey
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,my comment is how much is it the note pro is usd in my country which is hungary
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,definitely not samsung however what is your budget im asking because technically at more my comment is how much is it
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,what infinix model is the best when it comes to camera infinix zero pro and the zero ultra
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,absolutely beast phonethis phone is king of midrangeim using for months nowno regr more now its only my secondary phone but im very happy with it too charging is amazing display is buttery smooth mad bright and just overall very nice the camerajust one wouldnt call it triple is crazy good too which is weird heard it in reviews thats its bad but like it
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,hmm maybe the update is rolling out gradually also noticed they changed the way you open lo more interesting mine came with the april security update straight out ot the box
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,didnt so far havent received any updates either hmm maybe the update is rolling out gradually also noticed they changed the way you open lockscreen shortcuts you no longer need to tab and hold you just simply swipe them like every other phone out there oh btw the update brought google security april versionnot bad
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,main camera this phone up to fps it can also do fps
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,anyone noticed new animation when swiping out of an application after the recent update don more didnt so far havent received any updates either
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,infinix really put camera and paracetamol on their camera design
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,side mounted finger print sensor is trash for new release yeah so is charging at the new samsung phones that people are still buying at times the price of this one quit having unrealistic expectations at usd this is budget phone not flagship
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,plsguys should go for infinix note pro or infinix note vip because iam game person infinix note vip
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,kingfinix is the word combination between king and infinix knew that still doesnt make the sentence or rather the question any clearer
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,im sorry but dont even understand this sentence you got some words missing from it kingfinix is the word combination between king and infinix
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,then wonder what the kingfinix specific then im sorry but dont even understand this sentence you got some words missing from it
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,as said it before this isnt infinix specific its the same with tecno vivo sa more then wonder what the kingfinix specific then
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,the kingfinix should consider to prepare good software in the future for their smartphone ca more as said it before this isnt infinix specific its the same with tecno vivo samsung anything really full resolution pictures are highres mode only on every phone and thats perfectly fine
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,you can only take full resolution pictures in highres mode that isnt an infinix specif more the kingfinix should consider to prepare good software in the future for their smartphone camera then because if not their market segment could be taken by tecno camon pro if camons camera hardware and software could make the expectation as their video promotion
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,absolutely disagree with you on saying that it doesnt have great camera to me it took more said it was great for ordinary use may agree with you that it produce an excellent and eyecatching picture but my point is with its amazing big mp camera its still couldnt produce smoother line in picture while appreciate for the texture but noise and grain still intact next why comparing to replica phone that because it has mp camera to take photo and video but when it comes to take photo why the mp one only can be used on ai cam mode others mode like beauty mode document mode pro mode still cannot use the full advantage of mp the difference is that replica said it has mp but in hardware its only mp but infinix note pro has the real hardware but the usage of this amazing hardware is still limited wish that in next update they would add some of camera software enhancement that the user could switch between want to use the advantage of triple camera or just want to use the advantage from its super large single mp camera because still have an assumption that even when we use mp mode in ai mode there still the two other make the interference that caused noise and grain
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,yeah know but still comparing flagship to midrange is like apples and oranges lol it is what it is would rather pick the tecno camon pro think that one is better value
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,the feature is great for ordinary use for gaming the only good thing is bypass charging and more absolutely disagree with you on saying that it doesnt have great camera to me it took excellent pictures and comparing this phone to replica or fake phone is downright disgusting the triple camera part can agree with its more like really good single camera phone the main camera definitely isnt bad especially not for this price
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,in nigeria infinix also gave it ive seen on youtube from valor reviews channel it look more have also watched valors review just for fun and good on infinix for giving everything with their phones this time even more than everything
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,they gave me free wireless charging pad as well in hungary crazy good deal in nigeria infinix also gave it ive seen on youtube from valor reviews channel it looks like infinix is giving this in all countries
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,decided to buy infinix note pro watt free wireless charger device included box in my opinion best of the best affordable phone probably iphone pro comes with fps video camera so can wait iphone pro with this priceperformance infinix will order days later will wtite my opinons after test the pro infinix
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,leave him he is right thats rubbish why use mp camera in the first place why not more yeah know but still comparing flagship to midrange is like apples and oranges
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,youre comparing midrange with flagship are you out of your mind leave him he is right thats rubbish why use mp camera in the first place why not mp or mp selling gimmicks for my hard earned money they could have done the right thing but they wouldt mp wide plus mp ultrawide would have been better but no lets put gimmick lol
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,worst phone infinix note pro all features are here but not can pay upto for more then just go ahead and buy yourself phone and be done
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,wont say useful mp tuning on this phone wont be as good as samsung tuning on more youre comparing midrange with flagship are you out of your mind
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,waiting for complete review
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,beast the bad things about this phone only camera only usefull back camera cha more wont say useful mp tuning on this phone wont be as good as samsung tuning on ultra the specs only said video recording with standar pdaf rather than saying triple cam would like single cam with ois and laser af plus tof now the other cam on midranger are more like jokes than useful camera like flagship level the wireless is surprising part with midrange level altough may not sophisticated than cable charger with dc bypass like laptop and camcorder mobile sparepart getting more expensive by years so do they cut some features than years ago
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,since hot play infinix refuse to make phone with battery capacity of mah you dont need batt if you have charger
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,its mp selfie camera not thanks
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,helio is better than sd wdym yes
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,well mostly see that new sd chips like might be slower but they have more battery life
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,epic phone for the price but using snapdragon instead of helio will become the most more helio is better than sd wdym
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,very very good option for budget gaming with gbs of ram helio mah hz amol more please does infinix smartphone cameras get blurred and loose quality over time
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,whole infinix series stucked with helio gx processors to keep the price reasonable tho
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,can you compare it with the tecno pova pro
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,finally can rest nowinfinix packing this device with wireless chargingwhat took infinix so longgg
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,actually ure wrong ah yes ure
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,ill rarher choose the regular note than the pro version it just an enough good specs more yeah but the pro has an amoled
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,wireless charging from infinix was like the budgetflagship phones also infinix would mak more the wireless charger is included in the box
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,which of this should go for the note or vivo need phone that can serve me for at least yrs and
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,the screen is amoled inch not inch the inch is for regular note version not the pro version but the regular version is using ips lcd
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,fyi amoled is better than ips amoled looks better little bit with colour brightness and clear black technology but pwm dont like when phone flashes with its max brightness even on lowest brightness read how amoled backlight works and only because of that ips is much better for your health
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,technically speaking the devices are all equal when it comes to battery as theyre all more actually ure wrong
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,pls guys kindly guide me should pick infinx note pro or oppo kx becuz like game like free fireplug efoothball
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,hi could you please guide me in making an informed decision im currently torn be more technically speaking the devices are all equal when it comes to battery as theyre all mah however we should always keep in mind that more powerful processor consumes more energy it sounds like you are gamer so you can already consider or the dimensity as those are optimised for gaming and allrounder chipsets the umis chipset can also game but not as hard as those two devices you mentioned umis advantage of the two devices is the camera as it has sony imx sensor you cant go wrong with it but since camera performance isnt really your priority then we should remove umi from your option just to make things clear im not against infinix and this is just my personal opinion but the wireless charging and jbl speakers are just for gimmicks to compensate for the chipset you really dont need those features and you can live without them besides you can use your bluetooth speaker to amplify your sound experience and theres scientific study that wireless chary could potentially degrade the lifespan of the battery fast compared to wired if were to personally choose from the devices youve given id simply choose tecno the important part of all is the chipset which is the brain of the device it has the new dimensity which can definitely game and it comes with its best to future proof your device compared to the with only that already tells lot and you can tell that the is more advance
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,buy neither get poco pro thanks for the suggestion but its outside of my budget for smartphone right now ive listed all three that are within my budget range already
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,supposed to but usually dont most updates are purely aesthetic and bit of placebo more hi could you please guide me in making an informed decision im currently torn between three budget smartphones umidigi pro max infinix note pro and tecno camon pro want to make sure that choose the best option that can use for at least two years before consider buying new one as freelancer my phone is always in use throughout the day and im also an avid player of efootball pes if you had to choose one of these three phones which one would you recommend please consider battery life heavy usage chipset processor and other important features in your response thank you
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,why amoled uh thought at least infinix will stay with ips fyi amoled is better than ips
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,thats totally unfounded and baseless statement android updates are supposed to increase more supposed to but usually dont most updates are purely aesthetic and bit of placebo tend to roll back the os and root devices disable updates as theyre usually con
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,bro got wireless charge but no ultrawide lens this is more to the gaming specs suppose
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,do you really care about android updates on budget phone new android updates will make your more thats totally unfounded and baseless statement android updates are supposed to increase optimizations and efficiency while distributing new features and increasing device longevity
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,im sure the software is basically terrible even worse than funtouch
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,no android update no need to buy do you really care about android updates on budget phone new android updates will make your underpowered device laggy its better to have the version it comes out with no need to update if its performing well because new updates will most likely degrade the performance if youre casual user who only use phone for social media and want new features like new emoji then go ahead
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,does it has nfc option yes but its market dependant watched few reviews on youtube and it had nfc in all of them
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,they said the price is capped at maximum for all varians include non pro hope the pro one gb is
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,ip where ip is the norm so does mean it will survive sneeze but not tropical downpour little underweight methinks
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,no hdr functionality for the display
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,waiting for the regular infinix note
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,good specs but still helio nothing wrong with helio as long its under its just dimensity with no
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,many bloggers and some stores are saying that will be the suggestedexpected price of this phone if its real infinix will really keep the promise of releasing the note series under
Infinix,Note 30 Pro,iphone inspired ahh wallpaper
Infinix,Note 30,honestly infinix actually mistakelly make this perfect budget phone and the silently starte more yeah that note ages continously with the touch issues but some models with the same lcd screens still be used in some models and even tecno use the same components but reliability could be questionally improving their build designs in my record on note that released in april it gave major to android and yrs security so yeah but the official didnt stated that how many years that last maybe after launching android based os some models would promise major updates excluding lowend phones and with chips like helio or higher can be elligibly grant security patch if still working on it
Infinix,Note 30,yes same issues only solution left either reconnect the fingerprint sensor or change the fin more yes same after updating to to xos but the sensor didnt go bad immediately after updateit began malfunctioning which was solved after rebootingbut now its completely gonepower button works okbut the sensor dont
Infinix,Note 30,as of now writing this the final update has to begin not receiving security update anymore more yep cause think they made this phone perfectly for budget phone so thats why they abandoned it
Infinix,Note 30,found number of custom roms from specific channelshave anyone tried any of these romsespecially the xos ported to this phone
Infinix,Note 30,if want to update your infinix note pro you can update the update is very good updated mine last week and its awesome
Infinix,Note 30,looks like sofware updates have been finally stopped for this phone
Infinix,Note 30,well just want to say that the fingerprint doesnt work now its been year already more yes same issues only solution left either reconnect the fingerprint sensor or change the fingerprint sensor
Infinix,Note 30,pretty good phone for it price for gaming performance it pretty good with some tune up medium to heavy game well for camera cant comment cause am rarely almost never use camera and yeah for battery it drained pretty fast but it also charge quite fast well can say that am satisfied with this phone my score is for it price and dont hope too much for heavy game cause it lowend to middeend class phone not heavy gaming phone
Infinix,Note 30,the latest software update seems to be the final form of this smartphone whether there will more still lagging this day haha
Infinix,Note 30,one year and half of using this phonein the first month the phone already lags just by playing casual game and didnt do heavy gaming since my last phone
Infinix,Note 30,does anyone knows how to fix charging issue it always detect liquid on charging port though more yes do so what country are you from lets see if location wont be limiting factor thanks
Infinix,Note 30,the mediatek helio is now power hungry and kinds hot
Infinix,Note 30,charge cyclesnow it drains more quicker than ever guess the battery worn out already calculating years of use can say about charge cycles and already the battery is failingcamera focus is hate it have to manually focus everytime but okay recordingbut interestingly still works like charm like these old redmi phones from
Infinix,Note 30,drtriple nov one of the best phones from infinix better than any brand jn this budget segment how much is the phone now

Infinix,Note 30,it is type to hdmi ready type
Infinix,Note 30,new update security
Infinix,Note 30,this ancient device at the end of is very solid choice that id picked for its smooth efficient and quite friendly to use when upgraded to android straight ahead smartphones in have similar experience like infinix note hot or even tecno pova pova series camon and the like with similar specs as it is seems like the software improved bit and the refresh of helio ultimate is very popular soc in the budget range that transsion started to make first helio phones in infinix note pro so in this time im still using infinix note even some newer phones like note hot pova series spark or camon will receive android in some time so its fine im still using it perhaps imagine if note gave android shot then this is an insane value have been used that time
Infinix,Note 30,noticed performance drops in the new security patch
Infinix,Note 30,got this phone last june and so far still good for gaming cant believe its year ago when was brought it
Infinix,Note 30,good phonetotally have an great experience battery ok performance best screen ok etc
Infinix,Note 30,havvy use omg same too hours of battery under heavy use but if just watching or casual things then upto hours
Infinix,Note 30,benchmark result of geekbench cpu gpu compute cpu single core multicore gpu compute opencl vulkan source httpsbrowsergeekbenchcomvcpu httpsbrowsergeekbenchcomvcompute httpsbrowsergeekbenchcomvcompute best of helio have ips lcd including tecno pova neo in the budget segment no need to spend another one with helio thankfully its already android months ago were received an update gpu performance slightly increased compared to android
Infinix,Note 30,what is note avg battery timing havvy use
Infinix,Note 30,infinix note is very good phone and affordable price but have been facing series more after updating to android cant change refresh rate its always running at hz

Infinix,Note 30,note battery timing hrs while hz and on
Infinix,Note 30,nothing to do with the phone turn off the wifi or use ghz band because bluetooth uses the sa more he is right sometimes sound stutter no matter what you will doi guess the audio ic is the issue
Infinix,Note 30,new update august patch
Infinix,Note 30,only problem had with this phone is that when play music through my bluetooth earphones in more nothing to do with the phone turn off the wifi or use ghz band because bluetooth uses the same band as most wifi ghz it will stutter you music alot

Infinix,Note 30,note so simple but first buy note pro so bad battery drain night charging morning more because it has lots of bloatware app and ads running in background its common thing for phone with affordable price at least it has quick charge mode so you dont have to worry waiting for long time try to uninstall or disable some apps that you dont use in setting
Infinix,Note 30,good android phonei hate infinix note pro is weakbut infinix note is good devicei first bought note pro bettery drain so weak heating like note so simple device
Infinix,Note 30,one year using this phone so far so good only minor bugs that rarely happen but nothing big photo cam is also good cant say the same about video cam though bought this phone mainly for gaming social media good cam speakers are bonus for me got android update few months ago everything is even smoother hope this device can last up to years like my previous asus max pro
Infinix,Note 30,bruh guy from yt just exposed that ai camera is fake
Infinix,Note 30,is this support ltea and what is the cat version
Infinix,Note 30,anyone else noticing after the update the dual speaker quality has improved
Infinix,Note 30,finally my infinix note has had android update dont notice any significant difference but it feels more stable than before
Infinix,Note 30,hello would like to ask is this phone good for long term use year max please answer think yeah it depends on how you use it but as far as know budget phones like this can last for very long
Infinix,Note 30,everyone else noticing after android update we are not receiving google play system updates more google is up to update their system components not only on this version itself but also on any versions starting android or from so you dont need to worry about how the google play system update gets delay for sometime and its also noticeable on some phones nonpixel btw update june gpsu is up and its indeed rolling out on many phones running android
Infinix,Note 30,am currently using this phone upgrading from it at the end of year my only priority is scree more iphone pro samsung ultra
Infinix,Note 30,is there way stop auto update my auto update was off but still updated to android automa more disable google services frameworks

Infinix,Note 30,it just got android update cant wait to install is there way stop auto update my auto update was off but still updated to android automatically without knowing
Infinix,Note 30,after update its much better but they removed jbl branding from equalizer why tf
Infinix,Note 30,finally xos and android for infinix note
Infinix,Note 30,think xos and android good enough for me and for this phone because why because this phone use helio so if we update android it will be unstable so for me security update enough
Infinix,Note 30,to get loud sound go to sound settings disable smart modeenable music mode then option named use music sound will appear click that disable bass enable treble and vocal sound will become significantly louder than before but be careful sound quality wont be that good it will sound harsh to get quality sound use music mode disable treble and vocal and enable bass you will get almost flagship level sound with rich audible bass performance but warning volume will decreas by it will sound like you are playing at only volume
Infinix,Note 30,the sound is too low in nice product
Infinix,Note 30,its been months no xos and android update
Infinix,Note 30,rev iliya talmon apr gave my infinix note to my wife when insert her sim card the device was locked ha more its because of the phone was bought from different region than its original region
Infinix,Note 30,im buying this phone because of being told good enough for gaming in reasonable price more thats helpful tips ngl
Infinix,Note 30,gave my infinix note to my wife when insert her sim card the device was locked have not had any experience like that before
Infinix,Note 30,actually am thinking to buy this phone can buy or their is something more better dont hope too much for this phone the only problems is within the user who use it if the phone is in good hands it probably will be good and maybe even better dont complain too much blame it on yourself for not being an good user
Infinix,Note 30,what battery type used in this lipo or liion some sources use liion gsmarena seems to more this phone use lipo battery
Infinix,Note 30,infinix is kinda worst of all thodosent have software updates at alleven if has best perfo more well what do you expect from dev that gives phone with competitive hardwares in affordable prices of course there are always drawbacks at least they are still doing security patches as long as we dont use the phone on extreme way or too much selfmodification in os then it will be fine
Infinix,Note 30,its actually good it has by pass charging and refresh rate up to hzhad very good camera and speakerand also its very cheap its only rupiah or about but im complaining about the battery why need to be mahnot mah
Infinix,Note 30,dcoper mar till now infinix note not upgraded to android xos not launched till now infinix not saying about upgrade to

Infinix,Note 30,when play free fire games on finger mobile screen automatically freeze mobile screen multi touch problem solution
Infinix,Note 30,messenger bubbles when clicked while on game all text appears as thin line this problem more same problem but use multiwindow mode on messenger which can also bubble when you put it on side of the screen
Infinix,Note 30,youtube playback feature removed after update how to return it back
Infinix,Note 30,note screem is available in near by shop
Infinix,Note 30,for me note and note smooth gaming as well camera is good
Infinix,Note 30,this phoneget so for long use in this budget is good years you can use this phone wit more brother are using note
Infinix,Note 30,bro please tell me is infinix note good for long term use dont think so
Infinix,Note 30,its really fabulous at first thought all these specifications are not true but it more please tell me iss infinix note for long term uses
Infinix,Note 30,from my personal experience this device has many flaws that could be deal breaker such as lo more the low brightness is cuz of the screen type note has amoled and this one has ips amoled good for outdoor use and watching moviesseries and ips good for sharp images and gaming yes ips does have lower brightness than amoled
Infinix,Note 30,know that many wont recommend poco or pro as the pricing at some country is more expensive but if the pricing is not that much more expensive recommend would just settled with at least poco rather than this infinix note or note pro
Infinix,Note 30,ive used the phone for days and then sold it the phone is overall good gaming phone more it is but you have not to sell it think it have some few problems but thought it needs more good speakers too but when compared it to samsung ultra it has wayy better sound brobut as say it is too good for price and you can buy infinix note too or infinix note vip
Infinix,Note 30,it is excellent for the price bro gb ram is insanebut have disagreement for this phone more mine is good camera lol
Infinix,Note 30,yeah it is better optioni reccomend it in how much time its battery drain in normal use
Infinix,Note 30,same bro after the update am having serious issues with netflix and other ott platforms the vi more yes have the same probleme with my infinix note have you found solution
Infinix,Note 30,brother auto call record option is available on this device yes it is available in settings or activate with fingerprint
Infinix,Note 30,been using the phone for months and its very good for its price encountered more brother auto call record option is available on this device
Infinix,Note 30,another negative thing that forgot to mention was touch reponse rateyes they say its hz but while was playing call of duty on this phone there was some miss specially when was trying to swipe it wasnt working sometimes and they say its budget gaming phone they shouldve at least test the phone on lab little bit more before launching it there are many issues ive encountered automatic battery drain very weak display brightness quite and not so good stereo speakersluggish touch response are just some of the problems
Infinix,Note 30,battery very weak drain after day need to charge perday
Infinix,Note 30,wow this is great gaming phone like played pubg with it very great experience almost no heat with gfx it gives fps easy to spray with no wonder this called gaming phone
Infinix,Note 30,the best smart phone in this range recommended to all price on everything including battery timing is very fine
Infinix,Note 30,please add feature for translating text in screen or atleast clipboard translate
Infinix,Note 30,sooo the screen is little bit unresponsive on the lower screen and too many bloatware
Infinix,Note 30,dec for batteryi think you must reset your phone because its not normal before selling it took it to the infinix customer care center and they told me that am not the only one and that they are working on this issue dont know how they are gonna slove it as far as know the issue is maybe software relatedso future update may solve it
Infinix,Note 30,dont do the latest update you could get an issue of touchscreen response time delay happened more same bro after the update am having serious issues with netflix and other ott platforms the videos are lagging so much are you facing this issue too with netflix after the update
Infinix,Note 30,this cellphone is for playing hot games like pubg and genshin impact and its also wasteful if you want to propose to this cellphone you have to think again
Infinix,Note 30,infinix youre not losing the sale but youre losing the trust never again buying your product more why bro
Infinix,Note 30,am not going to say that regret buying this but makers must launch an update that will fix this super annoying battery draining issue because its getting worse day by day at this rate dont think the phone will remain usable after years guess will have sell it sooner
Infinix,Note 30,everything is ok but the software is too bad but yeah whats the point of having the phone if you cant properly interact with it
Infinix,Note 30,very bad software lagging in scrolling all time the app gallery is awful there is no soun more same here idk whats wrong couple weeks after buying the phone its all fine but then suddenly the phone became unresponsive even though theres zero physical damages being done definitely software issues
Infinix,Note 30,having delay and jumpy touch screen problem screen keep moving without the hand touching could be fixed after restarting the phone but only as temporary fix not long after the issue cameback please fix this on the next update infinix think the problem has something to do with the system app actions and gestures
Infinix,Note 30,these are the problems encountered while using the phone battery drain issue batte more use exact same one and wifi turned on only being wasted but yeah battery life is not expected unlike samsung ones with same mahno sound quality is really good but loudness is bit off especially while ringing have to full volume to heari use speaker while gaming gives me accurate directions where the enemy isand of course it is dim because of being ipsbut really good at night doesnt hurt eye with filter on or off
Infinix,Note 30,so is this dual speakers stereo or just dual speaker actual ly jusr dual speaker because its lack of staging
Infinix,Note 30,please guys infinix note infinix zero infinix note pro or redmi note pro nee more recommend xiaomi pro camera is way better than the iphone
Infinix,Note 30,what ufs this phone use want to know
Infinix,Note 30,it has im using this phone right now is there stylus pen of his
Infinix,Note 30,please which would you recommend from infinix smart plus smart or note from the nigerian varient or hot need good camera heavy duty and capacity

Infinix,Note 30,screen is bit low since it doesnt have gorilla glass and amoled although ips lcd offe more nope ips lcd screens is still power efficient at lowest brightness so do not underestimate that ips panel is not efficient using dark mode
Infinix,Note 30,why tho because perfection
Infinix,Note 30,how many system update does the phone have im thinking if should update or not haven more yes just updating is better if im not mistaken updated up to times
Infinix,Note 30,if the back of the phone body vibrates thats normal because its stereo if the more how many system update does the phone have im thinking if should update or not havent update my phone since bought it should
Infinix,Note 30,it comes out on top and bottom but when placing your hand it kinda vibrate in the center at more if the back of the phone body vibrates thats normal because its stereo if the sound problem is not heard it is better to update the firmware to the latest mine has had the latest firmware update the sound at volume is loud
Infinix,Note 30,redim note is better than infnixe note in after years the infnixe we start hanging but more infinix note and redmi note is not even years old since they came out
Infinix,Note 30,my mine is my speakers are on the top and bottom maybe yours is the chipset version ther more it comes out on top and bottom but when placing your hand it kinda vibrate in the center at the backalso when the volume goes mid can hear it but when it go below it cant hear it unless put my ear in itis it normal have variant
Infinix,Note 30,speaker is placed in the back thought it was placed at top and bottom can have tips more my mine is my speakers are on the top and bottom maybe yours is the chipset version there are people who say this another than is the cheap version

Infinix,Note 30,my brother bought it for ridiculously cheap price it has good appearance and specifications really but am not convinced yet as believe that decent software is as important as hardware configuration time will tell
Infinix,Note 30,which should go for out of redmi not redmi note or infinix note pro note pro
Infinix,Note 30,the heating problem the selfie camera is pathetic and the jbl speakers are the worst my red more buy flagship phone lah brother if you want everything perfect the price is suit with the phone
Infinix,Note 30,im from tunisia and have now the note im wondering why infinix put wifi on it in its really slow bluetooth but its ok wifi in the middle of thats really dump from infinix is there any solution to upgrade or amliorate the wifi performence on this phone infinix note
Infinix,Note 30,wifi ghz not working mobile infinix note router tplink archer from bangladesh
Infinix,Note 30,the hardware is great really great but the systems sofwaer and inside interface still need more agree with youhardware machine very good but software xos is very low infront of vivo funtouch and oppo
Infinix,Note 30,yes its more details and the noise is very low than redmi note the camera capture in low light is superb expecially with super night mode
Infinix,Note 30,there is two modeles of infinix note xb xb xbhelio ips lcd hz more thanks for the information and advice bro am sure the brand didnt want us to know that
Infinix,Note 30,please updating your software os continually its important for user experience inhand

Infinix,Note 30,just one less no screen protection they have it separately you either install it yourself and get it installed in phone stores
Infinix,Note 30,much better if this unit has have band network data there is version called infinix note
Infinix,Note 30,no screen protection like gorilla glass or thats why so cheap
Infinix,Note 30,yes camera is like really good and the battery lasts for looong time like think if we do more number badge available
Infinix,Note 30,redim not is good gaming phone batter than infinix not no
Infinix,Note 30,hifrom indonesia heretoday just looking this on marketplacemy eyes see lower price more infinix note already have nfc
Infinix,Note 30,if you care about screen quality probably the redmi if youre looking for better perfor more redim not is good gaming phone batter than infinix not
Infinix,Note 30,just bought this phone always on display and led light features are not included if you like to live in dark room you would definitely have to do some struggle to find your mobile
Infinix,Note 30,but the one got in nigeria is helio why is their specification bearing helio on more country variants
Infinix,Note 30,yes if non stop using its normal
Infinix,Note 30,you should by the infinix it has better specs than the samsung as yes more better
Infinix,Note 30,this infinix note page using wrong pictures for main pictures and phone colour option this page using note version pictures the only correct pictures is in the review one
Infinix,Note 30,please based on your experience is infinix note camera very much better than infinix hot more am using note best mobile and best performance in any and every department
Infinix,Note 30,is it safe to update note just receive system update gb should update will the more yes you can update your mobile phone and there will be no problems with mobile instead the mobile will become more smooth and more better after updating
Infinix,Note 30,think they should give type or above and also better gpu
Infinix,Note 30,which one should buy between infinix note or redmi note gany suggestion from anyone if you care about screen quality probably the redmi if youre looking for better performance especially for gaming definitely stay away from redmi note the note is overall the better phone with better battery life charging speed and performance note im referring to the model here if your country sells the model then probably go for the redmi
Infinix,Note 30,nice phone nice battery nice display hz nice camera nice display very good for the price charging very fast the only thing you hate the small font you barely read on top of the phone and heats lot when charging but overall good for the price you pay
Infinix,Note 30,how long does the batry takes to be fullly charged frm less than an hour
Infinix,Note 30,whats really wrong with infinix why writing specifications shipset helio on their website and the one got for myself in nigeria is helio please can someone explain
Infinix,Note 30,is the speakers loud for example is it louder than oppo stereo speakers phones
Infinix,Note 30,this camera is fine or not plan to buy
Infinix,Note 30,redmi note longer battery life higher brightness amoled display faster storage inf more mean why do you need higher brightness
Infinix,Note 30,is the battery bad how day does it last this my main right now if your using it no stop it gets hours
Infinix,Note 30,have go to service center to fix it but use other sim card no problem it say this sim card bought at singapore simba got problem but when use to other phone no problem at all have test phone no issue so service centre say cannot do anything waste of money only have to use my old phone back
Infinix,Note 30,redmi note or infinix note redmi note longer battery life higher brightness amoled display faster storage infinix note better performance bluetooth stereo speakers higher watt charging
Infinix,Note 30,how long this battery
Infinix,Note 30,pls between infinix note and samsung as which is worth buying will go for infinix note very good phone to use and gaming
Infinix,Note 30,the high consumption of battery might be because the application you use is demanding and req more pls between infinix note and samsung as which is worth buying
Infinix,Note 30,just bought infinix note around one weeks already now cannot call and received incoming more would tell you to take it to the service centre but it frankly might not help you at all they might replace it but the new one will do exactly that after using it for approximately the same period just check to see if there are any updates and pray to god that its the last of your problems with the phone but im not too optimistic after all its transsion holdings device this will always have but software optimisation and if you ever get an android version update then count yourself lucky
Infinix,Note 30,how many multi touch support only dude
Infinix,Note 30,is it set hz you can adjust it in the setting but yes it has hz
Infinix,Note 30,transsion just loves to use the helio series on its entry and mid range phone

Infinix,Note 30,pls want to know from anyone who is using infinix note phone how strong is infinix note more charging is fast in about an hour it goes from to wired the battery is mah enough for day usage for heavy user like myself

Infinix,Note 30,ok ok thanks am only getting the phone because redmi note has band and missing from more please did you purchase the infinix note did it come with coverage am also in similar situation
Infinix,Note 30,the infinix note comes supported with the following band in africa and most other places more uhmm is there way can confirm this at the store when get the phone like said really need bands
Infinix,Note 30,it actually comes with hz refresh rate in nigeria
Infinix,Note 30,yes widevine drm is supported on all infinix note models but on some regions like in indonesia that saw online it gets only on netflix due to the video codecs does not mark as secure but it remains should be detected of other streaming platforms and in drm info
Infinix,Note 30,at least would make snapdragon processor than mtk wc seems weak
Infinix,Note 30,more the infinix note comes supported with the following band in africa and most other places
Infinix,Note 30,is it widevine supported yes widevine drm is supported on all infinix note models
Infinix,Note 30,wouldve gotten this instead of the if it had an oled screen there was note pro which is also equipped with amoled
Infinix,Note 30,does anyone bought it how good is it the camera speaker display performance battery the note is very gudi bough my on june battery very strong camera great infact everything about the phone is gudbuy and enjoy
Infinix,Note 30,would love it more if its screen display was amoled ips lcd screens turn me off
Infinix,Note 30,so does infinix get os updates or not
Infinix,Note 30,will they ever stop using the term triple camera for fake camera setups like this one this phone is clearly single lense phone it has mp main cam mp depth sensor and dubios mp aicamsensor usually photos taken by fakelense phones like this one look worse than those of the mp shooter of year old pixel that was less and is much less nowadays what shame
Infinix,Note 30,design is good and cool and very handy love it but im bit disappointed that the no more youll be confused that the note is powered by helio which is identical specs to the note depending on your region you will get either the helio or helio so there is helio version of note is just note
Infinix,Note 30,they made snapdragon powered phones once before and never again httpsmgsmarenacominfin more yes can attest to this cos had the phone as of feb used till this its pity was even at store yesterday to check out the device and fpy out that it was designed with helio processor better go for tecno camon pro that has its way better
Infinix,Note 30,note still running on network dont understand
Infinix,Note 30,when wil they run out of those helio processors at least use the dimensity ones
Infinix,Note 30,no infinix mostly uses mediatek and in some occasions unisoc they made snapdragon powered phones once before and never again httpsmgsmarenacominfinixsxphp
Infinix,Note 30,cant this people just use qualcomms snapdragon processors for once no infinix mostly uses mediatek and in some occasions unisoc
Infinix,Note 30,infinix in behold our new note with helio

Infinix,Note 30 VIP,please how long do your battery last on steady usage want to buy one but alot of feed back more it depends on how you multitask the apps but it lasts when gaming you should use bypass charging to avoid heating problems
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,anyone else having netflix freeze issues while watching with this phone at first thought it more the same with me im using infinix gt have contacted netflix they said infinix is the problem already email infinix but no answer
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,upgraded my infinix note vip to android just weeks ago the upgrade was seamlessly more how long does your battery last on full charge mine is approximately hours with gaming and normal usage the phone performance is great just the battery consumption after the update is bit of concern
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,ever since upgraded my infinix note vip from android to the battery drill fast pl more noticed the same thing too unfortunately had to formatwipe the phone but the battery still keep draining fast and it gets extremely hot how wish can go back to the old android and enjoy your he phone better
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,just updated to android have not noticed any major changes except some ui changes and the homescreen infinite scrolling between the pages doesnt seem to work anymore dial pad changed bit battery seem to last slightly longer maybe longer
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,any new features or bugs in which country did you got the update from the phillpines and about new features not much but like the ai wallpaper generator
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,had this phone since and it is very good except buggying when hot ald fps is joke battery isnt that bad
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,still using vip actually camera is so good no need to edit coz vip have ai enhancement and gaming is good but problem is little delayed response scrolling think os bug problem
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,does anyone facing battery draining issue how you fixed it already updated mobile and playst more uninstall phone master app update
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,anyone knows if can get this phone in europe really need saaaa who ever can get me the same type please dont like por really need the vip
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,anyone making negative comment about this phone clearly doesnt know what he or she is doing
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is the overheating issue in gaming fixed now cuz im planning to buy it but heard that it more you just need to do system update it will be fixed
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,good phone but the camera lacks ois and ultrawide this is one upgrade infinix should try and add to the upcoming note series just like the camon series equipped with ois
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,definitely you bought fake product wonder if its this infinix note vip im us more my note vip camera is very bad
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,heating problem how to fix it even during calls without gaming
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,where buy the product london indonesia philippines or singapore this phone isnt release in indonesia
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,very good cell phone have it and it is lasting very well feel that it is very good for gaming highly recommend them
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,just need phone that will last good couple years with updates guess sorry for spa more the tecno spark pro launched for pkr any opinions
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yes the phone camera is very bad
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,where can we buy this phone it is out of stock where looked
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,havent heard good things about the pocos battery life though want to stay away from more just need phone that will last good couple years with updates guess sorry for spamming its okay dont want to go for infinixtecno why was gonna say the zero ultra is still really good value phone and now that youve upped your budget itd definitely fit altough that has curved display but then maybe the tecno camon premier could be even better as for discord dont have one but if you type my name into tiktok search will come up and you can text me there
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,so after looking into it little bit more the still seems like the most balanced best more havent heard good things about the pocos battery life though want to stay away from xiaomi in general dont want to go for infinixtecno just need phone that will last good couple years with updates guess sorry for spamming
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yep im just looking for phone for daily usage how would you compare the vs redmi more so after looking into it little bit more the still seems like the most balanced best option for you on the other hand im curious now when was looking for great value phones saw that pakistan has the axon ultra on sale but is that actually true thought that phone was cancelled also saw something called sparx mobile do you have any thoughts on them never heard of that brand before
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,hey so obviously the pro would be the best overall but if performance isnt the mos more yep im just looking for phone for daily usage how would you compare the vs redmi note pro they both launch at the same price pkr though the comes with gb ram vs gb the poco pro do like but its bit pricy just need good phone for daily usage and multimedia etc whatsappyoutubechrome browsing generally if you have discord can add you if that works to discuss whats available and what phones can choose from moto edge may launch next month but dont like curved displays if theres anything else around this range other than the phones that listed do let me know and ill take look
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yo didnt know how to message you was the guy from pakistan who needed help in purchas more hey so obviously the pro would be the best overall but if performance isnt the most important for you the has the best cameras and still great everything else the motorola is the one id get if was looking for main phone but the pro will be supported for longer longest of the bunch the note provip still have the most physical features like wireless charging but lack in cameras and software updates the latter is fine by me but for some it may be important
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,its in the box bruh do you even have eyes the box only includes wireless charger the is optional its still crazy that they include any wireless charger let alone fast but not ultra fast one
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,all of them are identical httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparemediatekdimensity more yo didnt know how to message you was the guy from pakistan who needed help in purchasing phone still havent bought anything what would you recommend within budget moto launches recently infinix note pro is still available redmi note pro launched for same price as poco pro launched for pkr just need something that will last few years with good display etc
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,you have to buy separately the wireless charger its in the box bruh do you even have eyes
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,recently buy infinix note vip and regretting my purchase choice used gsmarena to find more correction apple has the best os
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this or infinix zero theyre both very similar
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this note vip been waiting for song long so bad she was never release in indonesia
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,what if nm android rear mp front mp mah dolby on screen fingerprint display with light notifications as asus max pro and design
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,the back light is scam it lights but only time lol
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,infinix note vip in nigeria price is today
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,on specs wireless in real life wireless from note pro you have to buy separately the wireless charger
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,started from infinix note pro can play mir smoothly with all high settings and the vip is superb
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,infinix is lied with vip part name dont see any in the name of vip in this phone this phone is poor specs no ipsertificat gorilla glass ois ultrawide and gyroeis and the brighness still low peak than cheaper phone give more brighness and should this phone use super amoled not amoled vip but shame
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,no eis or ois
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is this cp design for global usage why is it some times no signal suddenly they say over heating mot really just keep it on simple settings mstly it does mot heat when its off ok
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,cant get the camera to save photos to the sd card by default anyone knows how do set up the camera so that it saves to the sd card by default
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,im experiencing problem with my phone where lose cell coverage when it goes into sle more experience this too since the new software update did you find any fix
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,does infinix smartphone cameras reduce in quality as you use them probably after two years more my note have best camera have seen and with magic ring its the best for use with the price
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,its worth buying but hope they fixed the overheating issue does infinix smartphone cameras reduce in quality as you use them probably after two years do their cameras last long or should look for another company and buy from them
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,those of who already have the phone is it true that it overheats all the time not true that it heats up too much normal heating only due to high usage of games but on regular used it does not heat up specially when its off
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this midrange king isnt talked about much it has almost everything you need in midrang more where though this phone is most likely been phase out
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is this supported by dito sim here in the philippines think it does because it supports almost any sim in the country your in ggg or networks is applicable and it support any sim in its size in the tray but some dont even though it fits hope it helps
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,did you already try removing bloatwares my battery stop decreasing if put my phone on airplane mode
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,my phome battery decrease about at night when the phone is on sleep mode is this normal did you already try removing bloatwares
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,theres issues with saving new contact directly from true caller note vip doesn more doesnt show the option for add new contact only exsiting contact option please solve the issue infinix note
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,try updating your phones firmware to resolve bugs and other issues try to update to latest update for more and lower the temp level
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,does anyone experience screen unresponsiveness when clicking some things like the screen just more yes bro the ui hangs you have to teset the settings to resolve the issue
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,does infinix note vip have radio yes
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,josephine sep bought my infinite note for pesos my first use after two hours of use it gets ho more try updating your phones firmware to resolve bugs and other issues
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,the latest firmware update is really nice and seems to have solved previous bugs
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this is the phone with minor changes would have actually shaken the indian market note more and any future variant with or tb would be great with small additional to the price
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is it in nigeria market already yes bought one last week willing to sell though
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,based on current info now gt pro is better gaming phone due to builtin cooli more infinix gt pro has hitting issue and bettery beckap is bad
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,processor is over good camera not best but over good connections perfect wifibtcellularalso pc connection need to be easiest but work good sounds connection music hi res sound wery well charge and battery think will be in next gen phones and wireless quite enough pack including wireless charge and typec to aux cable design depends on you liked weight didnt like cam design and material could be more quality my point last word for this price this model is excellent and more than enough no need to pay more priceperformance
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,if youre looking for phone that has bypass charging then do not buy this for some more well it is so you cant argue about it
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,can anyone confirms if the note vip have the new chat gpt folax ai assistance it has
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,poco phone arent stable hope know that poco series are stable you cant compare it with the poco and series thats like saying the infinix note vip is bad because the infinix hot is garbage
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,when infinix note vip will be available in saudi arabia local market
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,it is tuv rheinland iso which is european standard approved that additional point
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,its available in eu alza de at cz sk hu has it for euros ok good to know not really that inexpensive anymore though
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yes it has radio im using it now how about the battery is longlasting
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,no yes it has radio im using it now
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,at the price point of the gt im getting the poco pro instead note vip is only more poco phone arent stable hope know that
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,why would compare it with the price of in my country they are on the same price already
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,the gt pro is only marginally better in terms of camera but charging and gaming goes to the more based on current info now gt pro is better gaming phone due to builtin cooling which is vital aspect for any real gaming device as far as ram is concerned if the game will even utilize all that extra memory am really looking forward for fullreview of gt pro as well as note vip so all of us can get better sense between these
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,if you are gamer or even casual gaming enthusiast then the infinix gt pro beats this more the gt pro is only marginally better in terms of camera but charging and gaming goes to the vip they use the same chipset but vip has higher ram gb than your better gt pro that has hahahaha
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,the tecno camon premier is far more better than this in terms of camera and storage you cant compare it with the price
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,infinix note vip is the best if you are gamer or even casual gaming enthusiast then the infinix gt pro beats this note vip which is really an allrounder smartphone with shines on the charging aspects both wireless and inwire
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is this really good
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,only infinix not pro is the best infinix note vip is the best
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,since the phone is new most games does not support hz refresh rate yet one is codm back camera is indeed mp but its not that better compared to the iphone xr which is only mp bigger image is pointless if it is not clear definitely disappointed on the camera quality but mostly use the device for gaming
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,its hard to use if its not updated os
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,note vip of course thanks bro
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,so far this is the only news about software updates coming infinix if os upgrades from more from infinix note can get android xos at first android xos think infinix note series will be able to update at least os update maybe will get android xos
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,bi monthly security patches no updates sadly so far this is the only news about software updates coming infinix if os upgrades from to and is not going to happen then this is dealbreaker not even sure how thier os updates at all if monthly or quarterly does anyone know for sure
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,how many years of software update this phone will get bi monthly security patches no updates sadly
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,which one should buy between infinix note vipsamsung iphone xs max
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is it gb for ram or plain gb ram it has gb of ram it also has more ram to use so in total gb ram
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,infinix note vip is better because the antutu of it can have staggering in antut more tend to somewhat agree with you on this but my concern is the updates from infinix dont see any info on their os update policy do you know and can you pls share it salamat
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,what is better this or infinix zero infinix note vip is better because the antutu of it can have staggering in antutu scores which is almost the same as the sd flagship chipsets
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this is either an absolute lie or the note vip is greatly overpriced official price is more in the philippines the price of note vip is or usd while the poco costs you for the gb ram and for the gb ram which in usd is or
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,choose zero because of chipset good with heating agree
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,pls guys should for infinix note vip or redmi poco fpro because their are same price in more this is either an absolute lie or the note vip is greatly overpriced official price is for the infinix about for the and over for the pro
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,unfortunately they did not release this one in thailand they just did
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,what do you prefer guys this one or the tecno camon pro cuz im planning to more on paper the infinix looks good
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,dont mind him the phone is very good and much far better than tecno spark pro yes youre right the phone is nice
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this one is full packed variant of infinix that can compete with others flagship brands this is awesome
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,bloatwares and battery draining are the downside of this phone how would more what do you prefer guys this one or the tecno camon pro cuz im planning to buy new phone have budget worth of and cant decide which would choose casual gamer not too much interested when it comes with phone cam
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is the lcd glass durable thiis phone has amoled
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,why did you say infinix note vip is worse in everything pls reply fast cause im thi more dont mind him the phone is very good and much far better than tecno spark pro
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,poco pro far far better than note vip yes and price is doubled in comparison to vip
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,in abuja bought mine at banex how much bro
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,please where did you bought it in nigeria here in abuja bought mine at banex
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,the point is we cant find very complete specifications with soc that is close to flag more dimensity is rebranded chipset of dimensity
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,the software support bloatwares and battery draining are the downside of this phone same wi more bloatwares and battery draining are the downside of this phone how would you know this when it just came out you mention its because this phone is made by transsion but havent experienced any of what you mentioned on my infinix zero ultra and my tecno camon premier and so far my infinix note pro is doing good too except for the slow if any kind of software updates but dont mind that
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,does it means that one can not upgrade to the next android version that comes up and the batte more dont worry about that issue this phone has powerful but efficient soc and comes with the latest android os so you can still use it for few years to come
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,its better to safe charge than to fast charge the battery most of the time because it more nice one guy
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,wow this phone almost had everything from its flagship chipset to its micro sd slot headphone jack which are not present on most flagship smartphones the only thing could question is why the builtin fm radio is unspecified it also has bypass charging wired wireless charging and reverse charging capabilities which makes me really blown away to what infinix did to this very exact phone its actually like super hybrid smartphone which has budget friendly features like mention above while having flagship chipset at selling price of typical midrange smartphone really love it hope can buy it for sure
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,get the vivo note why did you say infinix note vip is worse in everything pls reply fast cause im thinking to buy it
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,marven jun am interested in buying this phone but the fact that infinix ignores updating their phones more change the software with pixel experience hope it helps infinix allow its user to change software through laptop or computer using various software the most stable software for any phone is pixel experience you have great interface and get the android updates first on your pixel experience
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,am interested in buying this phone but the fact that infinix ignores updating their phones makes me step back and think of another brand
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,oof this phone is almost meant to be the replacement for my redmi note pro but sadly it ha more my exact same reasonings
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,infinix if youre reading this fix your horrible software ui and fix your android os updates
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,charging speed is too slow always on safe charging speed is like what to do to maximize
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,thanks its cool device its still smaller than my current honor note that more yeah guess so but the screen is at least taller find mm of width to be just enough for me but if you want even more than that sadly think you might be outta luck
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,when did note phones stop being bigger than regular phones id like fe more get the vivo note
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,can you imagine how insane zero pro would be with dimensity would more find it hard to wrap my head around what is it that you find so incredibly amazing about the zero pro
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,ikr really love that phone best looking infinix phone ever imagine it with all the good more the note vip is worse in everything but the soc and the charging specs so yeah it would be dope to see an infinix zero pro with the dimensity or with the charging specs of this phone
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is mediatek dimensity good its pretty good yeah
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yeah it might confuse people but anyway since zero series will stay wouldnt com more can you imagine how insane zero pro would be with dimensity would be happy even with the helio powered zero pro if could buy it from anywhere but cant would gladly overpay too but its just impossible to buy it infrom hungary
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,seems that they will keep zero series and also add gt for their flagship wou more yeah it might confuse people but anyway since zero series will stay wouldnt complain about zero and pro rerelease with can you imagine how insane zero pro would be with dimensity
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,hey im reviving this little chat about the zero series to tell that leakers spotted zer more seems that they will keep zero series and also add gt for their flagship wouldnt want that either but im glad at least they might keep the zero series as well thank you for the information
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,really really and mean really hope they change their mind of their naming zero series wa more hey im reviving this little chat about the zero series to tell that leakers spotted zero on geekbench and bluetooth sig and will come with dimensity gb ramgb storage and android also infinix gt pro is expected during the end of this year with amoled fhd hz curved display mp ois main camera and gb ram gb of storage android mah battery and their tech with fast charging all specs are leaks and nothing is confirmed except the release date which was informed by infinix seems that they will keep zero series and also add gt for their flagship
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yo will the infinix zero get the bypass charging when updated to android and when more think it would be useless because it has different hardware and it cant be solved by software update
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,even qhd is useless it takes up more battery and theres barely difference from the normal more depends on the display size as well my current main which is the vivo note has inch display so think at that size it needed the qhd resolution that it has sure it might take more battery life but there is always an option to drop it down to either hz or keep it at hz but drop the resolution down to or both now dont need either of these options rock my phone at max everything since thats what have payed for and it still lasts me more than day but you do have these options
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,every new iphone except the se series has fhd displays they might have little bit more more even qhd is useless it takes up more battery and theres barely difference from the normal human eye unless youre going to look really close
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,have you even heard of ppi or are you just living under rock ignore the resolution if more every new iphone except the se series has fhd displays they might have little bit more pixels than this but its still below qhd so those are completely pointless
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,recommend you not buy note pro but note vip instead dimensity is times perform more dimensity is just dimensity rebrandedand dimensity is bit more powerful than snapdragon but also bit weaker than snapdragon
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,reccomend buying infinix note vip than the pro version since its only helio the gpu more so far the helio seems plenty fast too and ill switch back to my main anyways which has snapdragon gen can only recommend the vip to people who game lot or can spend extra on wireless charging otherwise the pro is better value
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,it sounds like big leap for dimensity chip but believe thats just rebranded but more just got my note pro so we will see how the display fares really is just but that is all good since that is very powerful chipset
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,better buy note vip dimensity is like snapdragon it sounds like big leap for dimensity chip but believe thats just rebranded but still choose regular note because lcd display dont want to pay more for amoled repair though
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,if its matte then it clearly wouldnt be clear would it now yes but you can still see the colour of the phone also some colours actually look better when theyre matte
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,then use matte cases if its matte then it clearly wouldnt be clear would it now
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,almost all but the most expensive clear cases will be yellow after months of usage then use matte cases
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,not sure really but am planning myself to buy infinix note pro or maybe vip this might more if you can wait for couple of days will be able to tell you my opinion about the note pro which just ordered today from the usual site that order from which is alza so ill have the phone tomorrow or in days at max ill be switching from snapdragon gen powered vivo note and then ill be keeping the note pro as my secondary phone if its good enough
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,depends on usage if they use their phone outside everyday they get yellow faster than mo more no matter what they are terrible as for the expensive clear cases those would be good but good luck finding one for an infinix phone
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,me they look garbage and im not clumsy to drop my phone screen protector to prevent micros more you might not be clumsy but unless you guard your phone chances are your gf your wife anyone even your cats dogs may knock it off the table
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,some of it has ultrawide and others doesnt then some of it has dedicated microsd card and others dont have what is the real specs so confusing
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,compare it with iphone eh close but not the same
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yes can see that its also different from apples wallpapers compare it with iphone
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,no basic mp wo af ultrawide why oems are ditching this feature in their mid budget phone but yet when they include that same basic mp ultrawide you moan and complain as well humans smh
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,no the wallpaper in the render yes can see that its also different from apples wallpapers
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,they have different wallpapers thats how just that simple no the wallpaper in the render
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,who the heck doesnt put on case me they look garbage and im not clumsy to drop my phone screen protector to prevent microscratches is the furthest ill go
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,im glad this still have microsd on it rather than blindly following apple and saying it as innovation and rightnow they shutting down their photo cloud saas oh boy
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,but it would look bad who the heck doesnt put on case
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,the zero sounds cooler than gt imo absolutely changing to gt is just doing copy of other brands lets hope that the upcoming phones are not copy too
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,put on case and it wont get scratches but it would look bad
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,if this one comes with snapdragon gen and infinix add uw camera instead two useless mp cam it will be direct competitor for poco
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,infinix already confirmed that zero was the last device of the series they might releasea more the zero sounds cooler than gt imo
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,vip edition with plastic body how put on case and it wont get scratches
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,plastic frame is absolutely not more durable than aluminium frame agreed my galaxy with plastic body is lighter than my nokia but isnt durable as the nokia
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,oh dont get me wrong its fine that this phone has plastic frame just disagre more everything aside this may be the lightest phone ever released by transsion with mah or more battery capacity
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,that would belong somewhere in the zero series would like to see future zero models with more infinix already confirmed that zero was the last device of the series they might releaseannounce later this year the gt series to replace it its somewhat similar to what tecno did with its phantom series turning them into proper flagships with the exception of the first phantom phone by the way the charging is expected to debut on infinix gt according to leakers
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,cue the trolls with unrealistic expectations for phone that cost plus in ikr they will always be there like no appreciation for anything
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,definitely but really dont see what all the fuss is about most phones if not all more oh dont get me wrong its fine that this phone has plastic frame just disagreed with it being more durable than aluminium altough this phone does have glass back and imo id much rather have plastic back since you have to put case on it anyways and then have aluminium sides which you might be touching every time you pick up the phone depending on your choice of case in fact my current main which is the vivo note technically has plastic vegan leather back and aluminium sides which think is the most premium combo you can geti know that is flagship phone and this isnt but still
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,still looking forward to that review though
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,but plastic is superior in terms of durability see nothing wrong with plastic plastic frame is absolutely not more durable than aluminium frame
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,glass back and corning gorilla glass he was talking about the frame being plastic
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,some sources it doesnt have microsd slot can someone verify me on this it has microsd and audio jack for wired earphones
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,was more than enough for me even on laptops unless you peep the pixels at micrometres and if you do that often your eyes will become so bad you wont need highres displays anymore
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is infinix scared of supporting hdr video playback according to the review saw it does support it
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,its possible if heshe is reviewer and got it before launch or if they have connection more in the less than off chance that your suggestion is true that person still wouldnt be able to daily drive it enough to formulate an adequate opinion on it realistically as this is the internet that person just made it up to inflate their ego little and feel somewhat better or whatever because its nearly impossible for reviewer that is big and therefore worthy of getting early access to products to be here wasting their time with anons
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,and how is it not true they have different wallpapers thats how just that simple
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,no because its not true and how is it not true
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,at least it is honest
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this is now available in asia for usd for the gb model
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,im glad to see this brand still provide microsd not like other just blindly following apple and saying it an innovation lol
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,real vip
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,use this phone as my daily driver how it was just announced today its possible if heshe is reviewer and got it before launch or if they have connections to leaked products
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,no its rebrandded not and ther is improvment over all of them are identical httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparemediatekdimensityvsmediatekdimensity httpswwwgsmarenacommediatekdimensityofficialessentiallythesameasandnewsphp
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,thats about right but the is good chipset so dont see that as negative no its rebrandded not and ther is improvment over
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,oh and no ones gonna talk about the matching wallpaper to apple no because its not true
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this phones specs feels like holding premium midranger but giving us to our consumer as an affordable midranger for everyone seems the company use since the dd chipset platform does not get empty of their inventory so it is win to our consumer enourage to buy phone like this in lowprice dont to be assume still budget phone after all
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,vip without ultrawide camera basically means very idiotic phone
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,no ois no ultrawide camera this is not real vip
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,model names choices from these ragtag brands are hilarious vip very important phone assume it seem as if they are trying to compensate their shortcomings with flashy model name
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,yes many leaks on twitter says it has mp ultrawide camera if it doesnt have one then despite the chipset this would be huge downgrade from the note vip
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,this is dimensity rebranded right thats about right but the is good chipset so dont see that as negative
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,and bypass charging which is asus rog phone feature indeed always forget that they has bypass charging since its feature from more expensive devices honestly hope they sell note vip globally with no changes in specs so might get one
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,gb ram wireless and for less than is an insane value for money they also gi more and bypass charging which is asus rog phone feature
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,is this true will be used this is big upgrade from the helio note vip might be my next phone if price is good
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,deleted post use this phone as my daily driver how it was just announced today
Infinix,Note 30 VIP,lets gooo theres the vip version
Infinix,Note 30i,no information about gb
Infinix,Note 30i,please someone should help me comment on the selfie camera the selfie camera is little bit better meanwhile the selfie camera doesnt focus mostly if there is sunlight it keep showing too much whitethats the phone im currently using almost months now
Infinix,Note 30i,recently welcomed the infinix note into my tech repertoire and its truly gem th more cool boy
Infinix,Note 30i,please which woukd you recommend for good camera heavy duty and capacity infinix hot infinix note or note although noticed that nigerias note is the online qualities of note cause note hello instead of goo said online

Infinix,Note 30i,does the front camera have punchhole or teardrop design teardrop watardrop design
Infinix,Note 30i,finallyinfinix packing some devices with wireless chargingwhat took infinix so longanyways well done infinixi can rest now
Infinix,Note 30i,hi just came to realize after looking its specs there must be helio or not with amoled display but lower processor its make fun of the brand company must think about it if there is possibility
Infinix,Note 30i,almost seamlessly chin display this year smartphone is getting better at adapting eyecatching dispaydesign not fan of the look of the camera tho but reasonable
Infinix,Note 30i,good backside design budget phone with amoled not bad
Infinix,Note 40 5G,whats the number of the camera
Infinix,Note 40 5G,for everyone did someone used the micro sd express for this phone consider buying one if it specifically the tb variant thanks for your inputs and suggestions
Infinix,Note 40 5G,whats the point of putting an sd card slot on this device everytime reboot my phone the default path of camera app is always saved on internal storage instead of sd card slot need to change the storage path everytime launch the camera app dont want to use the format as internal storage as an option can anybody advice what should do have lexar gb sd card and everyone says it is reliable brand of sd card besides of sandisk brand which used many years ago
Infinix,Note 40 5G,can anyone help how can set my newly brought sd card as default storage path for example captured something and want to save it automatically to sd card instead of internal storage thanks
Infinix,Note 40 5G,meaning your sd card is not compatible with the smartphone there are several things to consid more what type of sd card does this unit supports thanks for help
Infinix,Note 40 5G,it couldve been great everything was better than my old infinix phone bought this one literally for the half terabyte storage to handle some of my storagedemanding games and then the gpu had to come in oh my god do yourself favor and dont get this thing if you want to play or emulate games im assuming it works well on games like mobile legends and codmwhich it promotes wouldnt know dont play those but lord cant even get straight fps on ppsspp my old helio literally had it on max and it still ran so smoothly most hoyoverse gamesand by extension games with ton of shadersalso run poorly star rail graphics flickering in and out and zenless zone zero is an unplayable mess dont know what they were thinking by putting this instead of mali gpu because nobody wants to optimize for that
Infinix,Note 40 5G,sad support
Infinix,Note 40 5G,the heating is bad recently bought this note and it heats so much my old note has better heat management at normal usage the note heats at and the note is only at also the touch is off in my note have no issues in typing but in the note it doesnt touch letters sometimes
Infinix,Note 40 5G,oh really im about to buy it glad red this one maybe im changing my mind mine is
Infinix,Note 40 5G,does this model support arcore saw the one supports it but cant find confirma more yes it does just bought mine now cause need arcore too
Infinix,Note 40 5G,on camera app it cannot change the default path from internal storage to sd card it says quo more meaning your sd card is not compatible with the smartphone there are several things to consider before purchasing sd card such as type and class where to use it sd cards have also specifications that suits your needs
Infinix,Note 40 5G,can confirm the phone has ufs storage but the note pro has only ufs
Infinix,Note 40 5G,theres no such thing as gt pro stop the bs the only bs had was confusing with
Infinix,Note 40 5G,bought my gf an infinix note in it worked flawlessly until now and it still worki more phone in nice hehehehe
Infinix,Note 40 5G,did this phone will last to years
Infinix,Note 40 5G,best gaming phone ever recommend
Infinix,Note 40 5G,bro theres note coming out soon
Infinix,Note 40 5G,youd rather buy gt pro with that money how many times have this been copy and pasted theres no such thing as gt pro stop the bs
Infinix,Note 40 5G,from the latest news they gave it ufs an amoled hz with dual speaker and to top more youd rather buy gt pro with that money how many times have this been copy and pasted
Infinix,Note 40 5G,this are all main features mp camera ufs an amoled hz with dual speaker and to more ufs are you sure about that lolll
Infinix,Note 40 5G,just realized all transsions phones doesnt have ultrawide except for the tecno more not really infinix zero
Infinix,Note 40 5G,fairly priced guess only big for me complaint is no ultrawide camera just realized all transsions phones doesnt have ultrawide except for the tecno phantoms
Infinix,Note 40 5G,yes mp setup wouldve been better than mp one cant stand phone more blame microsoft for that theyre hampering computers than run solely on hdds or other computers with smaller capacity ssds and hdd in each on side note the brands should be blamed for infesting their products with bloatware same goes for mobile phone brands like samsung forcing microsoft amazon hancom aliexpress and gameloft apps upon innocent users
Infinix,Note 40 5G,would rather have one camera than cameras two of them are pointless this are all main features mp camera ufs an amoled hz with dual speaker and to top it off they gave it microsd slot mm jack an infrared blaster and came with android out of the box anything to add beyond that are just pleaser nothing to be mad about just an extra addition to be please at
Infinix,Note 40 5G,mp suck on that apple
Infinix,Note 40 5G,wow low pixel density this thing must be pixelated even in the menu horrible at least screen is better than one
Infinix,Note 40 5G,stop using mediatek is trash infinix its time to switch to snapdragon gen or gen more for those who complained about the chip in infinix habe zero it has which is better than its gaming experience and overall performance is excellent play cod updated
Infinix,Note 40 5G,id rather want unisoc than dimensity wireless charging is useless af and its just gimmick like virtual ram
Infinix,Note 40 5G,kieran may global release sorry to say will say not to buy infinix note bought it around days ago it was working well but last night the shape of the phone is changed curved shaped now dont know what is the reason but think due to battery heatup went to the customer service centre and they are saying its happen due to heavy pressing but it is not happen in my case my phone was never fallen not pressed since am using it in short will recommend not to buy this phone
Infinix,Note 40 5G,global release
Infinix,Note 40 5G,yes it has microsd card slot few tech reviewers already shown the sim tray of this unit more good to know its weird that gsma lists this phone with no sd slot
Infinix,Note 40 5G,cheap phone with no sd cardmm jack pointless yes it has microsd card slot few tech reviewers already shown the sim tray of this unit and it really shows micro sd card slot behind the sim card slot take this video as an example its in filipino because this unit was was released early in the philippines today at the mark he already showed micro sd card slot on the sim tray httpsyoutuberhrntetmq
Infinix,Note 40 5G,better than vivo pro and xiaomi redmi note honor mobile phone best
Infinix,Note 40 5G,honestly dont care yes bluetooth exists but my god its inconvenient to use an more bcuz know many chinese brands starts copying apple base on features yes its useless without mm jack and just bcuz of dual stereo by jbl speaker guess honestly respect ur opinion recommended iqoo zx or poco better chipset and also mm jack ofc
Infinix,Note 40 5G,kieran may bro bluetooth exists or can use type version of earphone guess or maybe use wireless more honestly dont care yes bluetooth exists but my god its inconvenient to use and phone at this price should have both features if samsung can do it why not the chinese
Infinix,Note 40 5G,so pro then the heck are they smokin over there haha
Infinix,Note 40 5G,hoping for global release it will be the same price as note pro

Infinix,Note 40 Pro 4G,because of lack network in my country well just still few area with coverage so th more would choose the any day as it is cheap er and still fast enough and offers ip with faster watt charge
Infinix,Note 40 Pro 4G,in bangladesh note gb ram price is and unofficial variant gb ram is so decide to buy the version for better performance meanwhile there is no then why wast to much money for this thing
Infinix,Note 40 Pro 4G,the secret beast of the note series for those who dont care aboutneed its more absolutely the same kinda happens with pro variants

Infinix,Note 40 Pro,the chipset of infinix note pro is helio ultimate not dimensity this is the version
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,says poor picture quality but the detailed information says rear camera is mp and selfie more do you think megapixel define the quality of the camera you need to study what megapixel meaning is camera quality in smartphone is all about sensor and software big megapixel literally mean large image size only
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,pls those infinx noteb pro have network and where can fine it cos have looked fo more also need the for this phone
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,display quality is not good it is amoled but not feel good

Infinix,Note 40 Pro,after month using it still not find any bug on this phone very satisfied with low price high specs love infinix note pro im not find any other phone better than this within this price range
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,it doesnt worth it regretted buying it poor battery life when did you have the time to use it enough tot talk about the battery longevity thts insane
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,band is good band not updated no wifi no battery cycle no update android
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,don go buy fake phone come here dey give negative feedback please get dictionary
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,is or dimensity means
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,definitely not worth it it doesnt worth it regretted buying it poor battery life
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,infinix note pro or infinix note because iam game personwhich one should go for note pro graphics smooth play game
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,mean infinix note pro doesnt have memory card slot if dull or single slot
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,it doesnt have back flashlight there is look on the bottom right of the flashlight icon and press on it
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,well the infinix note and the note pro have the same specs therefore there are two thi more mean infinix note pro doesnt have memory card slot
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,water proof or water resistance no they failed in that aspect bcos brought months ago and little rain beat me on bike till now the phone wasnt able to turn on
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,the processor of the note pro is helio ultimate while that of the pro is dimensity
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,yes to overheat use for month and battery not optimized maybe is you open much app right
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,worstever camera main and selfie capturing garbage shitty images always overheating device more yes to overheat use for month and battery not optimized
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,samsung have been making looking specs phones for long time even now if you compare them in more you deserve hug
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,fkng worth it for the price but have an issues this phone is easily get heating for playing games
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,infinix getting cocky and start making low spec expensive phones like samsung previous models more samsung have been making looking specs phones for long time even now if you compare them in same price you can get infinix phone with much better specs than samsung samsung phones in budget categories and middle categories are garbage
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,any opinionsis it worth buying itbeen using samsung lite till now definitely not worth it
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,can you explain it more generally if any network issue contact mobile operator wifi problem more have same issue too using hot but wifi sometimes disconnect recent
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,it says infinix note but theres no stylus redmi also has note series but no stylus if want stylus then go for samsung
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,processor is helio ultimate europe
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,infinix is sweet at the start
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,my halo light also doesnt work on vintage green any idea why is it or the green vintage that is doesnt have halo loght
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,reset my infinix but is not working
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,the large writing is too small can get it bigger
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,suddenly my ir remote stopped working does nayone have any solution about it
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,pr succeeded in making this superb phone but its nothing to the vip version last year avoid this phone not even good for its price range and it heats up
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,its predecessor the note uses dimensity which is better than dimensity at more note use helio that dimensity is in gt pro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,am using the infinix note pro the halo feature is not available in the vintage green more not true have vintage green note and it does have halo light features the vibrate are not soft but rather it vibrate like it should be
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,which part of the phone is disappointing its predecessor the note uses dimensity which is better than dimensity at the same price just go for the gt pro instead if its releasing in your country its probably better
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,the fact that this is downgrade compared to the previous note is just disappointing which part of the phone is disappointing
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,where we get in dubai uae
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,or and its better choice processor
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,poor network speed can get almost mbs with
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,year not it very sad for notepro user to upgrade new product the notepro shot video but dont know why they decided to degrade the camera to is not fear
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,infinix note or pro is same specis infinix hot pro dont waste your money
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,year old gpu year not
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,oh here we go again with another person that thinks phone wont work anymore after it more you put him in his place
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,please onless youre looking for rgb light or bigger screen with android dont wa more same mother company bro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,infinix note regular vs note pro which one should buy and why explain in detail with more well the infinix note and the note pro have the same specs therefore there are two things missing on the note one is the headphone jack and the other is the sd card slot apart from that everything is similar but go for the note
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,talk with facts are you seriously comparing sd with helio which is better everyone kn more agree sd is collaboration between qualcomm and tsmc mediatek which is dubbed as the sd one of the cpu is clocked at ghz which is still one of the fastest currently mediatek though came out may is only lteg chipset that simply can not compete with any sd and above httpswwwgsmarenacomqualcommreclaimstheclockspeedtitlewiththesnapdragongchipsetanditsghzcpunewsphp
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,the dimensity is weaker and less power effecient than the ancient dimensity in the over one year old galaxy which you can buy now brand new for as little as usd imagine claiming you provide value for the money when even samsung has phones more powerful and cheaper than what you offer lmfao infinix is joke
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,this phone for eur is ultra trash ufs nm slower than my sd and shitty camera more talk with facts are you seriously comparing sd with helio which is better everyone knows if you dont know about anything better not give opinion
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,for gamers on that cpu nope there is bypass charging for gamers
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,dont understand property if dont have audio headphone jack why not put an certificate water protection like ip
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,few lags and stuter on xos hopefully they fix it on coming updates
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,no sd card gb would be better if they can compensate it
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,look specifications all is good but after just or years evey infinixtecno smartphone more you must be buying their low end series which arent built for long lasting performance
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,dss my best choice like it
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,yeah like really the pro only adds some faster charging but smaller battery and some more more pro version is the one to go unless someone really wants more ram and even faster charging speed the good thing about having more ram is the stability of the whole system and apps on long term but even so gb is still great amount
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,my kind of phone honestly love itcan swap with my note
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,meanwhile if we take look at the efficiency core only in gen vs thi more how did you comparing old below average midrange chipset with current gen flagship chip
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,much better dimensity or dimensity
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,am very very disappointed with infinix on this note pro and the note pro how can they insert this low specifications in this phone dam much prefer infinix note vip than this low newly produced infinix note pro and the note pro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,im impressed by the pro version more than the pro think this will be my next phone
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,this isnt ufs as supports it quite disappointing hopefully camon will be next
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,best in the note series yeah like really the pro only adds some faster charging but smaller battery and some more ram not really worth the extra few bucks if you ask me the pro does look like the best deal of the series
Infinix,Note 40 Pro,decent specs for the price
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,no is bummer the dimensity only supports pfps and pfps video recording
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,looks downgrade of the normal pro because the life own the pro racing edition the only downgrade to this phone is the chipset and the idea of mah battery so the phone looks good at curve display and it did catch up with that problem with of charging literally experience it at mina honestly its better than mah that mah missing is nothing its better to have dont regret buying it if other people dont like this flagship phone just buy the most expensive samsung or apple its so much better
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,frame drops in mlbb
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,okay the first time bought this phone is me having without tech tok knowledge loved this phone because of that in the first time now regret it after week wanted to return it but it was too late because it was week ago the problems faced is the os mean all of them coming from the phone physically itself the first problem from it was the scratches even tho it was protected with screen protector and the phone frame itself regret it all wanted to switch now but have no more money to switch it and also these types of buttons sucks volume button broke and stuff
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,update track of infinix is not good please do not buy
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,got this last year no support from infinix their website is joke all links to support user manual etc are dead the only working link ive found is to basic faq page its still running android despite being released about months ago infinix claiming to provide major software updates with the phone mine was bought in england but there is no option in system settings to select this country england uk great britain for language etc so the next best choice is usa which means the date format is wrong the holidays shown in their apps are also wrong dont know why it has this issue but assume this phone has been deliberately restricted to deter sales in the uk other features are generally quite good with the acception of only an average camera speakers though could do without the additional infinix bloatware
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,note was silently released and the support was gone because of the helio ultimate chip
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,expensive but only antutu score wth
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,down grade version of the note vip yet expensive
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,the last october update messed up the battery usage making it lagger and hotter than before
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,battery has started to drain after the last update of october security patch
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,for the pro plus please infinix switch to dimensity or series with gpu mali mc or more well transsion holding still thinking about bringing dimensity series or another flagship chipset coz price range so dont expect too much
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,huawei honor magic pro is the better than infinix not pro plus etc lol the price difference is almost triple so ofc
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,infinix zero is better than this onedimensity is lot better than but when read lot of reviews about zero it has problem in zero where after upgrading to android it became laggy opening from shutdown from minutes to more than minutes and more
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,in comparison the zero has better chipset dimensity better cores where split the big core to and small cores to too compare to note pro has chipset dimensity the cores split to and where big core has and cores to small cores but when did my research on zero it has problem where after updating to android it became laggy and more in note pro has any problem like that
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,im puzzled about these reviews do any of you actually own the phone im in shock more super agree own one and its the best it did not disappoint
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,had any issues on note pro like shuttering
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,which is betterinfinix pro plus or realme pro infinix note pro makes sense
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,the makes difference
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,in my honest opinion if you want the note pro unless if youre buying it for the more which is betterinfinix pro plus or realme pro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,which is better buy between this and the infinix gt pro with price difference of aroun more definitely the gt pro mean it has better processor the only thing the note pro has over the gt is its faster charging and wireless charging and the headphone jack its up to you if those things are something youd prefer over way better chipset and way better gpu since theres been some hiccups for the img bxm gpu the dimensity have as for the camera pretty much the same
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,astc texture not support which is very vital for most of high end games like mir do not buy this phone
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,stop using these type of gpus they have alot of glitches in most of games and issues
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,the battery mah thats very little it fully charges in half an hour and less mah than most phones isnt much
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,they call it pro yet it has downgraded mah batterynot proand otherwise splendid phone
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,genuine question here who actually records video on their phone coz ive never fel more lot of people records video in specially those flagship users the target market of this phone is obviously not its ois version is the base one
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,hahahahayesbased on the onboard hardware and customizationit definitely will yes own both no comparison the infinix makes the note pro feel like amateur garbage prior to this infinix was xiaomi and samsung buyer infinix rocks regret ignoring them for so long
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,wouldnt the previous phone infinix zero the one better than this the price is more this is mobile this is highest price for mobile
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,forsure infinix sucks even in the current generation they produce high end phones with no more hey bro lets look at its price and the features it offers and it al ready way too cheap so why are asking for more
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,note pro is about more expensive than zero in my country but the latter is way better with rearfront video funny enough now official store run out zero stock when note pro come out my suggest is get zero if want infinix or get something better than pro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,downside is the battery
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,whats better infinix note prog or honor magic pro huawei honor magic pro is the better than infinix not pro plus etc
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,that does break my heart but everything else is worth it words of brand fan not words of better tech fan
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,its nice to have fm radio it would be great if it had mm jack and ip
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,im so disappointed with the battery of the infinix note pro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,this device might just place the xiaomi redmi note pro plus in dust hahahahayesbased on the onboard hardware and customizationit definitely will
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,camera will be quite underwhelming camera would give the phone better appeal
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,not really the companies are actually laughing at us cuz their only goal is to make profit not more hahaha
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,hope infinix released this phone in indonesia soon
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,lowkey looking like the redmi note pro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,when users write their opinions do companies benefit from the feedback and improve their products not really the companies are actually laughing at us cuz their only goal is to make profit not customers satisfaction
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,the note is way super good phone in the sense that infinix is improving like do you know what it takes to have ram and wireless charger with jbl speaker on itlike to me the phone is better and best that we pay for it
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,available for buy
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,im actually quite disappointed with the processor and the lack of video with fps even though waited for this guess ill stack my money on the tecno phantom or pro
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,finally this year note series infinix has promised years of update so that makes this phone complete now
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,so if this phone doesnt offer much features then what does the redmi note gg oh more fair often dont focus on software nor charging speed focus alot more on cameras chipset ram and display but eh fair points wish could bring up but you can flash other android software but after seeing the hyperos bootloader requirements and knowing almost no one flashes their phone to different os guess this excuse wont matter and also didnt mean to compare the base and non plus pro variants to the oneplus nord ce with that out of the way they should definitely merge the pro variants this phone is way too lackluster to be whole seperate phone
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,the successor of note has arrived
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,after playing short game of find the differences with the pro and pro plus variants of these phones the only differences are ram amount battery size and charging speed dont know infinix dont think want to waste dollars on what looks like the pro variant but with extra gbs of ram and better fast charging even phones like the oneplus nord ce poco pro and even the redmi note are better than this phone in the dollar price segment know the phone wasnt made for professionals in mind and know parts are expensive but this being dollars while barely being different from its nonplus variant is borderline criminal
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,definitely camons series this year is better than guess have to wait for the zero series
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,dont understand what is mm jack tuned by jbl can someone explain
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,lol if you want an infinix note series phone the note vip is literally better its cheaper more note series does have bypass charging it should be included in the note
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,camon series better than this phone
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,mtk is like but shoulde been better if they put mtk
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,what the point of having faster charging but reduced battery capacity to mah compared to non plus variant with its mah seems okayish for most people
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,no headphone jack weaker chipset but you getting an optically stabilized camera and magcharge still hardly even sidegrade comparing to the note vip
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,specs are good but chipsest is not shouldve added dimensity instead which is rebranded dimensity dimensity which is much better than the dimensity but anything better than that wouldve made this phone too close to the zero and that just wouldnt make sense
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,almost perfect phone but the lack of an ultrawide camera makes the note pro the better buy
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,almost pointless if the np is good enough for most the np has the same soc same oled bigger battery the same amount of storage and the same wireless charging gb ram even if expansion is off is good for most if was infinix would swap one of the mp cams for an uw cam to make up for euros
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,go buy note vip imstead as they are same devices at least note vip support micro sd too
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,excited from bangladesh
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,all these powerful chargingrelated features it was supposed to come with larger battery capacity at least mah
Infinix,Note 40 Pro+,come on infinix the pro should have an ultrawide at least the pro especially with the price tag
Infinix,Note 40,this infinity pro always stops apps saying app not responded with so much space have must experience smooth operations
Infinix,Note 40,good phone but have trouble in display another side of display can not work widiiih
Infinix,Note 40,any ideas on when next the security patch will come it usually update after months
Infinix,Note 40,so any news on the bypass charging not working properly after the update this is so frustrating google bypass charging does not charge battery if adapter could supply power to both battery and system then not charging is idiotic maybe they changed that
Infinix,Note 40,hope this could be of help here is the charging speed of the infinix note in detail infinix note smart charging mins mins mins mins mins mins mins min there types of charging speed but have always tried one mode
Infinix,Note 40,is there anyone experiencing issues with the bypass charging feature it seems the bypass char more yes manually activating bypass charging seems inaccessible now after updating wtf why would they do that give users choice dont just bluntly change how feature works some people paid money buying the phone to have this particular charging option really annoying another lesser thing is aod is not always responsive sometimes dim guess its adaptive brightness but in the settings adaptive brightness is turned off so again wtf it was just fine before the update
Infinix,Note 40,why it looks like own an apple phone
Infinix,Note 40,can someone help me after update my phone game play in fps not in fps need help you have an option there in settings for it if not found then rurn dev options on and search for disable default framerate for games and turn it on

Infinix,Note 40,have always owned an infinix device from hot but this phone is my first disappointment more dont shake the camera before the picture you took came in front of you as it took few seconds so if you shake the phone just after taking picture it will come as blur also always remember to turn on mp option before taking picture
Infinix,Note 40,front cam mp am disappointed amazing actually good display battery over all
Infinix,Note 40,best brand new budget phone at this moment got android and it costs really cheap in my country but the os needs to be fixed since sometimes it just said zenless zone zero isnt responding even tho its fine
Infinix,Note 40,hi someone knows if this model comes with macro camera thanks nope
Infinix,Note 40,using it for month so far so good cameras are good for photography but not recommended for videography moreover the sensors are perfect except the proximity sensor which is in fact virtual sensor that is no comparison to physical proximity sensor another isssue is there is no more wireless charger or power bank in the box which is very disappointing
Infinix,Note 40,okay can someone help me recently my phone face unlock feature cant work meanwhile it works for app lock tried to reenroll my face and it didnt work anybody know why
Infinix,Note 40,find the infinity note not vibrating for incoming calls yes
Infinix,Note 40,excellent display
Infinix,Note 40,the phones battery is pathetic doesnt last very long proximity sensor issue eve more used this phone this phone is amazing future camera out standing every thing nice on this mobile used this mobile since month no single issued on this mobile camera back and front out class
Infinix,Note 40,best charger maximum min full from to that was very powerful battery and charger
Infinix,Note 40,come infinix release the infinix note with higher screen to body ratio and add an ip ip ip am ready to buy another infinix note series again
Infinix,Note 40,different charging modes hot pro is while infinix note can use max power if put it more oh okay thanks man ur right
Infinix,Note 40,hey different charging watts but same in minutes note is in more different charging modes hot pro is while infinix note can use max power if put it in hyper mode which will do it in just minutes
Infinix,Note 40,yep will never ever buy any xiaomi phone cuz had bad experience with this brand ju more happy to help
Infinix,Note 40,because it has lower charging watt than note so slower charge time where is your common logic hey different charging watts but same in minutes note is in minutes hot pro in minutes
Infinix,Note 40,im using this phone all is good just sliding down menu is not working habe tried alot when more try hios launcher download it from google play store
Infinix,Note 40,dont listen to that other guy redmi has terrible performance is even worse than get more yep will never ever buy any xiaomi phone cuz had bad experience with this brand just thought that they make their phones better but it looked like they havent change thing phone get warm battery suck lagging issue so will go with infinix or an oppo phone thanks again
Infinix,Note 40,already do that and its still the same my phone is weeks old if this phone isnt meeting ur requirements can buy gt series for heavy gaming while can game on note series gt is more focused in that
Infinix,Note 40,update the phone dont play on charger but if do use bypass charging lower screen more already do that and its still the same my phone is weeks old
Infinix,Note 40,the phone gets really hot when playing games and the battery dies fast any solution update the phone dont play on charger but if do use bypass charging lower screen refresh rate use dark mode lower game graphics and dont place phone on hot areas such as under the sun and etc
Infinix,Note 40,thanks dont listen to that other guy redmi has terrible performance is even worse than get infinix note galaxy oppo those are the best for its money
Infinix,Note 40,xiaomi redmi for the price to performance very bad experince of xiaomi note is hanging due to processor
Infinix,Note 40,guys need your advice which phone on this list os the best infinix note oppo more xiaomi redmi for the price to performance
Infinix,Note 40,cuz its in smart charge mode theres also hyper charge mode which charges your phone from to more alright thanks brother
Infinix,Note 40,first of all how much did get it and where nd whats the major difference between th more pro version has curved screen and infrared port which allows you to control your home household appliances like tv or conditioner etc pro version also supports upto of charging power while the base model only has of charging power pro version also has better cameras if you buy this phone for daily use like social medias and play games then base note will do the job but if you want aesthetics and curved screen faster charging more better cameras then buy the pro model hope this was helpful
Infinix,Note 40,same issue in my infinix note black not an issue unfortunately for some reason the halo light is only available on the gold and racing edition not available on black and green editions
Infinix,Note 40,buy infinix note black abd there is no option available in phone about halo light same issue in my infinix note black
Infinix,Note 40,nice phone and have great camera with nice price
Infinix,Note 40,which one to go with infinix note pro or infinix note ofc note
Infinix,Note 40,does this fone have plus or simple yes infinix note supports plus although it is not mentioned explicitly anywhere but am using infinix note and it shows icon when internet is on also internet speed is much faster compared to previous models that only support upto
Infinix,Note 40,yes thats exactly what wanted to know does it have the ca carrier aggregator just more no problem and agree about that gsmarena should add more info about these phones small details and specs
Infinix,Note 40,used the app that you said in your response and it said that carrier aggregation is only ava more yes thats exactly what wanted to know does it have the ca carrier aggregator just like my oppo rx neo thank you so much they should specify it in the technical sheets because it is very important thing to know especially here on gsm arena which has an excellent database
Infinix,Note 40,thanks for the carrier aggregation this app rx monitor show if is present or not https more used the app that you said in your response and it said that carrier aggregation is only available in and also it said something like ca dont know what that means but hope it was helpful
Infinix,Note 40,checked the settings and didnt found carrier aggregation but the phone supports volt more the app tells you if the ca carrier aggregation is present only if the network is received on the phone saw now to force the thing ran speed test in the background which made appear on my current oppo
Infinix,Note 40,hi wanted to ask you if the italian language is available and if it has the carrier aggregat more checked the settings and didnt found carrier aggregation but the phone supports volte and also has italian language hope this was helpful
Infinix,Note 40,its best budget phone like it im satisfied with hardware and camera in comparison to realme and redmi realme is now pricy while redmi has bugs and they also not providing good hardware like lcd
Infinix,Note 40,have plan to buy this phone specs and performace how about the front and back camera work more its great for daily usage the battery life is so great it can record videos in fps both front and back camera and fps also for both cameras it also supports eis in video mode making stabilized videos now about the cpu its ultimate in antutu its great for daily usage and mediocre gaming its my st month using this phone and by far havent noticed any problems it includes case protector glass charger typec wireless charging pad and headphones the phone also supports wireless charging of watts now theres nuance about the color if were to buy gold note it has color indicator and the flashlight area that can display notifications and other stuff black color doesnt have that indicator so yea thats my experience with note if you have any questions feel free to ask
Infinix,Note 40,can tell me why changed ur note pro to note does ur last pro broken or somethin more no note pro is still working in good conditionthere are quite few reasons for why upgraded from note pro to note one is note pro have ips lcd display which is why its brightness is dim despite putting percent so during day time sunlight have problems with screen visibility it is too large to hold another is have already used it for years and was waiting for good phone from infinix note series that actually have more different features from its previous ones and infinix note happen to my liking also there is slight degradation in battery after years infinix note has amoled even if its brightness is only upto its is fully visible during extreme sunlight it is much easier to hold in hand lightweight and less bezzels compared to previous ones camera is also better than before so am having good experience with note
Infinix,Note 40,basically note with an amoled display at the same price at least in my country note would probably have dimensity as hot doeswhich is good thing since it means more futureproof phone good job infinix you have improved considerably from the last time purchased an infinix phone from late that is infinix hot also please treat and pay your employees well
Infinix,Note 40,the vintage green color is only exclusive to infinix note pro and note pro plus smartpho more yes it has green leather variant also lime uper variants
Infinix,Note 40,only in gold have green one but couldnt find it the vintage green color is only exclusive to infinix note pro and note pro plus smartphones or think infinix secretly released new colorway for the note
Infinix,Note 40,cant reset my phone it keeps reminding me to contact my device provider and automatic more it is device bought on credit so until you have finished the whole payment of the device there are some functions which are restricted
Infinix,Note 40,the screen sensitivity isnt good when scrolling sometimes it tap the reel and when playing game you need to tap multiples times for it to move
Infinix,Note 40,does anyone already explore the peek mode feature in the note mine have problem because more am also an infinix note user how to peek at whatsapp by swiping the screen to the left then tap the screen press the arrow down each incoming chat good luck
Infinix,Note 40,purchased infinix note days today and now its hanging the camera stucks while taking pi more same problem with me
Infinix,Note 40,didnt receive my wireless mag charger along the phone since it was limited edition more probably seller scammed you cause got the wireless charging pad forfree
Infinix,Note 40,because the vintage green color on infinix note is just only five pieces in the world so more very third class phone note bought it months ago it came out bad it is sitting for claim for month still not coming back triple camera told but fake cameras
Infinix,Note 40,have green colur note and cant find this color any where whats the problem because the vintage green color on infinix note is just only five pieces in the world so you have one also have one so remain three that is why is very scares
Infinix,Note 40,this or zero im confused on which to choose go for zero you wont be disappointed
Infinix,Note 40,update the software if not possible take the phone to carl care they will check it for free it more no no longer have the receipt because bought from slot cannot still be attended to carl care
Infinix,Note 40,what should be the best option to have this halo light activate should go to the inifnix se more it can be activated in the settings
Infinix,Note 40,many people who got infinix note obsidian black complained that halo light option is not av more what should be the best option to have this halo light activate should go to the inifnix service center
Infinix,Note 40,for which should go for note or hot depends on your budget infinix note is obviously better than hot if you have budget then go for note
Infinix,Note 40,no all the note series came with helo light they dont give halo light in infinix note in black color but they give in gold colour and in black colour they dont give ip ratings but in gold colour they have confused that same phones but in different colour have different specs dont know what kind of things infinix do such mindless working
Infinix,Note 40,best phone ive got so far loving the display and the speakers they truly improved from last years note charging is so fast like in like minutes
Infinix,Note 40,although it was written that all variants of infinix note had halo light option still it lo more no all the note series came with helo light
Infinix,Note 40,hmm even my infinix note pro with its telephoto seems better than this one what shame more store near me finally got the gt pro and am so tempted to change to it cause of how much better the specs on it are compared to the note series and isnt that much
Infinix,Note 40,any touch sensitivity issue is touch hard do experience this one thought im the only one any information on how to fix this or should bring this to the nearest infinix center
Infinix,Note 40,does this mobile have linear haptic motor
Infinix,Note 40,only note pro supports yrs software upgrades to android version no it is advertise for entire note series note and pro both will receive year android updates
Infinix,Note 40,because that option only available in gold version only in gold have green one but couldnt find it
Infinix,Note 40,it supports future android versions as per infinix promised watched it at youtuve thanks to more only note pro supports yrs software upgrades to android version
Infinix,Note 40,gsmarena please make its review because it has bigger sensor of megapixel sensor its bigger than hm
Infinix,Note 40,personally using excellent battery timing and superb interface nothing
Infinix,Note 40,ois not available
Infinix,Note 40,anyone has tried hows the heating issue when playing hard fpsgenshin games outside hou more it supports future android versions as per infinix promised watched it at youtuve thanks to the link in the orevious comment turned out to be whole discussion from infinix regarding the note series as whole and made promise to support until android version with security patches of course
Infinix,Note 40,gsmarena states gorilla protection on display of infinix note although inside official inf more bro try checking infinix youtube channel httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtvrssst they have mentioned that it does have gorilla glass protection
Infinix,Note 40,we are moving into but youre still doing gphones why because not all countryoperatorregion have full coverage yet were geting to it and maybe there are reasons for each person to stick with their old gadgets even one of my countrys minister still use her blackberry as of this minute
Infinix,Note 40,infinix cant update hello active light
Infinix,Note 40,no headphone jack use wireless one no sd card use otg that can carry microsd use it for watching movie so didnt use my internal storage upgraded from redmi note so yeah this phone is amazing upgrade every years anyway so dang this gud
Infinix,Note 40,we need headphones jack
Infinix,Note 40,no need to spend such amount on this phone
Infinix,Note 40,how many people dont understand its st of all why are you still using wired head more fr bro why are these people complaining about no headphone jack like just get wireless headphone and about no sd card slot idnt gb is enough
Infinix,Note 40,great no more headphone jack probably no card slot either another manufacturer to add to my more how many people dont understand its st of all why are you still using wired headphones if it really bothers you spend on amazon and get an adapter to stop complaining nd if you need more storage choose higher storage model and if it really bothers you get an adapter no one wants to see people complaining about sd cards and wired headphones
Infinix,Note 40,cancelled bcz no headphone jack
Infinix,Note 40,and can anyone here pls tell me whether there micro sd card slot for this infinix note model
Infinix,Note 40,its model has amazing any touch sensitivity issue is touch hard
Infinix,Note 40,youre most welcome the main reason switched honestly is because was fed up with more its model has amazing
Infinix,Note 40,does infinix note block ads no ads and now we can uninstall more of the system apps just need to update the software once out of the box the only apps that cant be uninstalled are phone master and xtheme think the rest can be uninstalled either manually or through adb
Infinix,Note 40,interesting review thanks for sharing in the end seems that upgrading from note to no more youre most welcome the main reason switched honestly is because was fed up with the slow storage access the note pro exhibited took the plunge and it paid off now only wait half second for the files app to populate instead of refreshing it for the next seconds lmao also opted for the vanilla note since didnt want another curved screen device too much hassle and careful handling id care for for daily driver
Infinix,Note 40,the only demanding game play is real racing know for fact it can run more is there card slot for this phone which supports microsd card bro
Infinix,Note 40,thank you for your quick response does this phone tend to overheat find it concerning if more the only demanding game play is real racing know for fact it can run fps on my note pro if locked to then its flat if locked to then about ish average unfortunately the note only runs it at tried all refresh rate settings too also discovered the display doesnt support hz strangely confirmed through adb testing too it doesnt over heat just warm to the touch warmer than remember from my time with the pro but certainly not as hot as the regular note yes also had that one for week or two out of those three the note is the worst offender if im on mobile data for just bit too long then can feel the phone getting warm already even with no data intensive use like scrolling reels regarding touch sensitivity yes it is plus if its highly sensitive but imo only to point all of infinix devices ive owned had stupidly sensitive touch responses which is jarring if youre coming from another brand the note tones it down to more manageable level such that dont mistype as often with it to clarify ive owned the regular note zero pro then note both variants and this note touch response rate is hz the hz claim never seen the claim myself is probably only under certain conditions eg with certain games andor with performance mode selected on the xarena overlay
Infinix,Note 40,ive owned note pro and just yesterday swapped to note note pros better more interesting review thanks for sharing in the end seems that upgrading from note to note is kinda optional here since you keep the most important like battery consumption performance and stuff but also matter of taste if curved displays works better for you or not
Infinix,Note 40,you should buy infinix note because it has amoled display but note is more expensive tha more surebecause note series is better than hot series
Infinix,Note 40,do they providing for free its reliably good chip despite being like ys old at this point
Infinix,Note 40,prefer an ips lcd display rather than an amoled display while they add their ram to or mah battery dont mind the chipset and im fully satisfied with watt
Infinix,Note 40,reviews on youtube started to appear and its official microsd card slot and headphone more yep its quite sad doesnt include it also the proximity sensor is software based while the light sensor is remained as hardware based like the xiaomi phones use the same virtual sensor called elliptic
Infinix,Note 40,note has virtual proximity sensor it is labelled as elliptic which is exist on some phones like the poco pro quite disappointing to be considered perfect hardware as the proximity sensor is not hardware based
Infinix,Note 40,once again waiter waiter more rebranded mediatek chips please aside from mediatek more is basically dimensity why not instead it is on par with
Infinix,Note 40,amoled yep think the price will be far higher than note
Infinix,Note 40,still using weird its very weird chipset even lags on pubg at lower graphics setting and heating too much in note using without doing any heavy task
Infinix,Note 40,no card slot confirmed
Infinix,Note 40,prefer spark pro plus to this phone no new thing camon has ois but note cannot bring ois apart from the pros and plus no ultrawide camera when tecno will be launching camon series watch and learn
Infinix,Note 40,great upgrades in comparison to note but it seems kinda lost in this new note series
Infinix,Note 40S,dont get it compared it to normal note and its literally the same ph more think the only difference is the note is curved display has dualled flashfront and only has charging while the note has charging and doesnt have curved display
Infinix,Note 40S,its just the same note but with more expensive price curved screen and slower chargi more its probably because of the added bypass charging
Infinix,Note 40S,good weight like my old mi lite shouldd actually wait for this instead of buying hot pro my hands are in pain really im not lying dont have big hands learnt my lesson now so next time is ideal not gg or anything of the sort
Infinix,Note 40S,it have curved display

Infinix,Note 40X 5G,tbad the infinix note is skipped for indonesia bcause infinixs factory who exist in indonesia didnt made this smartphone they made other smartphones of infinix instead theyre doing this bcause maybe theyre having too difficult to understand the blueprint of this smartphone howre unfortunate for infinixs office branch in indonesia to had productions crews who were unable to made this smartphone in indonesia due to maybe too hard for understanding the complicated mechanism of production for infinix note for indonesian laborers
Infinix,Note 40X 5G,question for those who have tried this device does it support dual band wifi yes it does
Infinix,Note 40X 5G,everyone is talking about chipsetamoled screendebating phonesbut im the only person and someone below the comment realise that this phone look like iphone pro maxima prank my friends when buy this and see they reaction haha xdthey think own some kind of bugatti or smth xd

Infinix,Note 40X 5G,please let my boy helio to finally rest in peace
Infinix,Note 40X 5G,this company did promise to do to smartphones what byd did to electric vehicles so we might more the transsion holding company does plan to make cheaper smartphones and more features to be on par with one ui for the next years lets hope infinix will consistently update the software better

Infinix,Note 40X 5G,will the selfie this phone camera be blurry or clear also compared to the helio ultra in more it would be very noticeably worse than average id rather take the at the end of the day the wont be as good as the but the difference would be small the by the numbers is almost identical to the with some upgrades to it it depends on whether you really want that connection
Infinix,Note 40X 5G,you might not know but the newly released infinix note looks very similar to the iphone more yeah its true thinking about why we are required to spend so much money while we can get phone similar to the iphone pro max at cheaper price with specs that are not much different my point is that now we can download many mod apps that make it resemble real iphone even if youre asked by friends why youd want to buy the infinix which is similar to the iphone just answer that its because it looks the same has no lag runs games smoothly at fps has durable battery health charges at watts equivalent to watts of the iphone supports tb sd card is very costeffective and theres no disappointment in buying the infinix
Infinix,Note 40X 5G,amoled or ips did you read the specs
Infinix,Note 40X 5G,it has lcd display not amoled
Infinix,Note 40X 5G,finally they were able to make the phone look like an iphone

Infinix,Note 50 4G,infinix note has stopped connecting to pc via usb cable it was all ok until the last system update tried everything found on internet and common knowledge enabling debugging from developers options selecting files transfer changing usb cable updating windows to get latest drivers etc even got new specific usb drivers from somewhere but nothing solved the problem really frustrated can anybody help in this regard
Infinix,Note 50 4G,nm
Infinix,Note 50 4G,any suggestions besides this phone
Infinix,Note 50 4G,wow have this phone note is good fhd amoled screen sturdy design metal frame is strengthened with armor alloy hz refresh rate always on display its performance is mtk helio is really fast memory already ufs besides ai folax there are many other features clear cameras because there ois and video there mode vlogs dynamic bar smart panel split screen app nfc ir blasterremote gyroscope sound is supported by jbl pc connection fast charging wireless charging bypass charging there are sos emergency features earthquake warnings kingfinix or infinix indeed is complete
Infinix,Note 50 4G,please yall what screen protection does this phonenote ghas is it the same with tecno camon
Infinix,Note 50 4G,everything is fine with this phone just little heavy as wight
Infinix,Note 50 4G,what special specs are talking about they are same in factyou should have gone for note more actually that hz has important effect on gamingmy note was limited to fps on pubgafter some configi removed the limitnow it gives fps even fps sometimes and only see this when turn on hz on the phonebut yes agree they should have bought the note as it is the same thing on performance even better note has headphone jack and sd card slot and frond led flashno one cares about metal frame as users will use silicon caseeven better note back panel is glassngl the note looks much better design wisenote camera layout looks like it was made on mspaint
Infinix,Note 50 4G,fantastic but needs improvement in camera upto mega pixels back and front ram upto gb tnx the infinix note has total of gb ram
Infinix,Note 50 4G,this is going to be my next phone am die hard loyalist for the infinix note series hop more go for it also infinix budget phone fan as they make sense in low budget
Infinix,Note 50 4G,if no gorilla glass protection this is not good would prefer plastic case with gorilla glass than metal frame without glass protection
Infinix,Note 50 4G,apart from the camera and cpu the redmi note pro seems same priced with better specs
Infinix,Note 50 4G,uuh okay metal in terms of specs how yes this is only infinixs favorite if th more my friend actually these phones how should put it if from my point of view and personal opinion would choose the redmi note why that one has corning gorilla glass chipset yeah its the same dude rebrand maybe charging is slower than this one at only watts but you get mah more battery mah you dont use it all day right redmi note also has longer updates than note for the rest its similar right amoled hz gg if you choose note maybe you go to the design or the material that has metal frame charging speed watt because starting from android symmetrical bezels magpad other features like bypass charging and such ip hey who would intentionally dip their phone in water well thats all from me try to listen to other peoples opinions too friends
Infinix,Note 50 4G,why would infinix do this bru just bought note for few days and then they release the more what special specs are talking about they are same in factyou should have gone for note broit would have saved you lot cash note is joke the biggest joke is the hz combo along with the weak jbl loudspeaker they come with not even your strongest phone or even playstation cant take full advantage of hz refresh ratethen how can this they just added the hz for basic menu scrolling even then dont think it will hit mark they basically scamming their customers
Infinix,Note 50 4G,bro theres no camera theres camera theres wide camera and macro camera one of them is au more lol the fourth cam is auxiliary camera
Infinix,Note 50 4G,such amazing features that are ruined by cameras island designed not sober like the samsung xiaomi or other top brands
Infinix,Note 50 4G,four camera modules only one usable camera nice what can say bro theres no camera theres camera theres wide camera and macro camera one of them is auxiliary lens
Infinix,Note 50 4G,infinix indonesia has released this phone in indonesia days ago sold out infinix needs restock
Infinix,Note 50 4G,think everything went into the display and maybe selfie camera and the most important cpu more so the infinix has better display better cpu faster charging better cameras better battery literally better in everything and your conclusion is that its inferior to the redmi am getting that right
Infinix,Note 50 4G,this infinix note design is horrible yr major android upgrade where redmi note get more the design is great but the fact that they removed the mm jack is problematic
Infinix,Note 50 4G,deleted post received
Infinix,Note 50 4G,donefinix
Infinix,Note 50 4G,lets hope they mean ultimate seriously in that itll be the last recycled chip of that design
Infinix,Note 50 4G,and with difference of only about euros between the note and note pro the difference in the watt and watt charging speeds and the mp and mp selfie and those several sensors on the back it is more than worth it in my opinion
Infinix,Note 50 4G,no ultra wide angle camera unfortunately

Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,the camera features are too low for me
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,the chip is extremely old its the same from more than years ago but with different na more agreed ultimate is downgraded years you can get dimensity at second hand prices
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,didnt try to justify anything simply proved you wrong oh and bbk electronics no more yeah darlingyext think they did its true that lot of mobile phone companies are making the same models just with different names since theyve been doing this to certain extent but now theyre going way overboard producing triple the number of models each year it seems like the phone companies are focusing more on the quantity instead of the quality next years model bussiness market electronic is vr headset and glasses ar saying of mark zukeberg era mobile phone and tablet is over except foldable phone httpswwwforbescomsitesbernardmarrtransformingretailwithaugmentedandvirtualrealitypoweredbyartificialintelligencethecaseofeyewearshopping
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,just admit it you know im right you tried to justify yourself but despite being told the more didnt try to justify anything simply proved you wrong oh and bbk electronics no longer exists tecno spark go vs infinix smart httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone there you go you wanted rebrands well there is true example never said tecno and infinix doesnt do rebrands they do you just made all the wrong examples but these are two are identical
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,imagine walking into the biggest shopping mall in your city surrounded by hundreds of differe more open vpn
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,same chipset oh wow that is shocking logic using that same logic that would basically mean more imagine walking into the biggest shopping mall in your city surrounded by hundreds of different smartphone models as you browse two models immediately catch your eye something about their design their elegance draws you in and without overthinking you decide to buy both unbeknownst to you these two phones are actually identical twinsrebranded versions of the same device but that doesnt bother you you love their aesthetics their presence and each time you use them they feel just as beautiful in your hands now imagine it like this its as if youre dating cute and charming girlfriend every day she seems to have slightly different personality but you dont think much of ityou just appreciate her uniqueness then one day on weekend date at her favorite caf you step away to place an order when you return you stumble upon an unexpected truthyour girlfriend has an identical twin and theyve been taking turns dating you all along because they both like you rather than being upset you find yourself even more captivated by the situation instead of problem it turns into something excitingyour relationship naturally evolves into threesome where the affection is shared and you embrace the unexpected twist of fate happy ending httpscdncartoonporntonhentaistorageimagesjpg
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,well they arent the same either the infinix is newer launched with android ove more since the consumer electronics industry especially the mobile sector has reached technological saturation point tsp this means smartphone manufacturers now have little choice but to introduce small incremental upgrades each year to keep the market engaged and prevent slowdown to stay competitive different brands take different approaches some focus on specific hardware improvements others work on better battery efficiency ai advancements or camera technology however these upgrades are introduced gradually because many manufacturers are now hitting the limits of current technology to navigate this companies hold strategy meetings with their advanced innovation committees aicsteams of researchers and engineers tasked with developing nextgeneration breakthroughs take samsung for example instead of rolling out major hardware upgrades this year they introduced one ui software refresh that sets itself apart from one ui even though the hardware remains unchanged this move buys them time to refine next years models particularly their nextgen camera sensors this strategy has become essential for smartphone brands ensuring stable production cycles while maintaining or even increasing annual profits with innovation becoming more challenging companies must balance technological progress with business sustainability carefully planning their product roadmaps to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive market source httpsdailygalaxycomzuckerbergdeclarestheendofmobilephonesandconfirmsthetechthatsreplacingthem
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,hahaha enough are you stubborn or me check the last time infinix hot pro tecno spark more well they arent the same either the infinix is newer launched with android over android has faster wired charging has wireless charging has ois on the main camera and has curved amoled screen instead of flat lcd different designs too you are simply unable to compare phones httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone there are infinix and tecno phones that are exactly the same you just couldnt find them and youve mentioned zero series being one which it isnt and wont be and it doesnt even exist it was just bad example
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphonediff see the more same chipset oh wow that is shocking logic using that same logic that would basically mean that the vivo pro was the same phone as the galaxy ultra and the iphone is the same phone as the iphone pro max no just simply no httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone these phones have different features different designs different cameras infinix has curved display vs tecnos flat one tecno has faster wired charging but infinix has wireless charging as well they both came from transsion holdings yes but they arent the same devices
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,if you want midrange performance chipset choose redmi note pro benefit have micro more what you want darlingyext this phone take it okay im done with you bye
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,infinix zero series has always been completely different from tecno camon series except for more httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphonediff see the same device chipset cheaper but change sensor camera
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,huh you forgot it on purpose this is rebranding of tecno camon pro infinix zero series has always been completely different from tecno camon series except for their flip devices forgot nothing the zero doesnt exist yet
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,infinix zero doesnt even exist huh you forgot it on purpose this is rebranding of tecno camon pro
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,you just follow me the end result of all this analysis phone if you want many gimmick ai more if you want midrange performance chipset choose redmi note pro benefit have microsd slot price other benefits outdated software no software updates outdated camera setup with no ois on the main camera and mp macro camera cheap build quality with plastic middle frame and plastic frame only ip rating instead of ip or better no wireless charging potential bootloop issues like on most nonflagship xiaomi phones not to mention that this is an old phone you can not find it new and even you find one that is still sealed its still phone with no warranty left and one that was made years ago thus the battery has already aged inside it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,httpswwwdevicerankscomencamerasensor check your sensor camera before buying smartph more infinix zero doesnt even exist
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,this whole brand looks like if xiaomi apple and samsung all merged together

Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,hello you from indonesian thats the price for southeast asia in europe and the uk more also bold of you to compare phone to phone literally different species of phone models for the same price of two phones yes theres major difference but if you were to compare two phones with both only having connection well infinix the transsion dominates the area youre kinda stupid to compare phone that supports connection to phone and dude there will be an infinix note too you dont need to rush so much this phone just got released like week ago dude
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,okay understand clearly id also like to ask something where on reddit can find anything about what youve said
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,youre all backed by gsmarena to push certain brands arent you absolutely no more okay understand clearly
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,please just to clarify one last time are you really as user mentioned on reddit there ar more youre all backed by gsmarena to push certain brands arent you absolutely not im just an active guy here that likes phones and heavily dislikes samsung from my own experiences and from what see in the store work at you stirring up arguments over different brands simply like this phone and you are the one that started an argument over it mentioning multiple other more expensive phones being better than this
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,for months youve been parading yourself as some kind of authority on highend smartph more please just to clarify one last time are you really as user mentioned on reddit there are five of you who are the most active users in this forum and youre one of them youre all backed by gsmarena to push certain brands arent you ive been here for the past two years and its always the same just the five of you stirring up arguments over different brands trying to push us into choosing the ones you favor even with active users here youre the ones who managed to dominate and create the very first discussion threads
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,at into the game the phone could only manage fps while hitting thats pretty war more the vivo note clearly takes inspiration from the huawei mate with its inch screen but honestly it just feels like vivo took the pro stretched the display to inches it feels like that because thats what it is and dont see anything wrong with that plus theyve added an alert slider which use literally every day so its important origin check in fonearena origin os features devices previous comment blocked by forum vivo note only up to origin thats false information right there my note has originos all of them do httpswwwvivocomcnoriginos its in chinese but if you scroll to the bottom of the site you can clearly see the official update list
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,the way youre thinking just doesnt make sense to me if big screen is what youre after more the note has originos as well good battery life no lag no issues why would switch when dont need to im not the kinda guy that upgrades every year plus just dont want foldable dont trust them any of them brand doesnt matter
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,oh this is beyond laughable for months youve been parading yourself as some kind of author more for months youve been parading yourself as some kind of authority on highend smartphones someone who demands only the best the fastest the most cuttingedge technology oh you are misinformed and know nothing about me ive got an infinix zero ultra as well really like that phone too always did and while that was infinixs flagship it wasnt exactly highend phone and yet when it comes down to it youre still clinging onto vivo note yeah because like this device and it has no issues plus its the biggest phone with flagship at the time of launch hardware in it on the market which is why bought it in the first place still stuck with device powered by the infamous snapdragon gen the chipset notorious for overheating and throttling under the slightest pressure please do yourself favor and watch teardown of the vivo note and look at how large the cooling is in it ive got no issues with performance no overheating or throttling either so tell me wheres that xiaomi ultra you keep worshipping if you truly believe in what you preach why havent you upgraded im not worshipping that phone its simply better than the ultra thats all there is to it havent upgraded to it or anything else because dont need an upgrade and dont want xiaomi phone either httpsyoutubeseutodyesiltghxvpkgxmwd ive been here for years but sure
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,revvl pro has gigs of ram but with better processor also far worse cameras less features way worse software and worse build quality
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,from europe but this has nothing to do with my phone preferences oh this is beyond laughable for months youve been parading yourself as some kind of authority on highend smartphones someone who demands only the best the fastest the most cuttingedge technology you talk as if anything less than perfection is beneath you and yet when it comes down to it youre still clinging onto vivo note like its some kind of technological masterpiece lets be honest this isnt about money is it youve had no issue bragging about premium devices acting as if youre above anything midrange but here you are still stuck with device powered by the infamous snapdragon gen the chipset notorious for overheating and throttling under the slightest pressure you ramble on about toptier performance yet youre running software thats two generations behind you claim to care about photography yet your camera hardware is laughably outdated compared to modern flagships so tell me wheres that xiaomi ultra you keep worshipping if you truly believe in what you preach why havent you upgraded oh wait perhaps youre just another loudmouth pretending to be tech enthusiast while secretly settling for mediocrity because lets be realif you actually valued highend technology you wouldnt be making excuses for holding onto an ancient device you would act not just talk but you youre just another selfproclaimed expert who thrives on pretending rather than actually keeping up with innovation at this point youre not tech enthusiast youre just someone who enjoys the sound of their own voice the harsh truth is youre not leading the conversation youre desperately clinging onto relevance while the industry moves on without you so no this isnt just ironic its utterly pathetic
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,are you from south asia from europe but this has nothing to do with my phone preferences
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,the previous model of this infinix series was priced at last year so the estimated price more or is big difference its not that easy to just go up the price ladder like that
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,the advantages of the infinix note pro main camera mp ois mag sa more my mistake but price tag for the snapdragon gen seems overpriced for chipset that could have been equipped with dimensity instead httpsmgsmarenacomxiaomiredminotepropricephp redmi note pro start price
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,are you really okay with settling for slower speeds yes because they aren more are you from south asia
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,let me make it clear youve collected many of your favorite flagship smartphones and more are you really okay with settling for slower speeds yes because they arent slow but deep down you truly need flagship phone to experience the best performance without any obstacles along with superfast speeds what are you on about my phone has just dont need those speeds isnt nearly as big of jump compared to as is compared to id rather have better cameras faster charging and better build quality than
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,hahaha its so weird that one of my comments got automatically deleted by forum when mentioned the price ram and external storage detail info realme big win
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,the speed difference simply doesnt matter to me dont use my phone for anything more let me make it clear youve collected many of your favorite flagship smartphones and most of them are highend devices you seem comfortable with connection but deep down you know you truly need flagship phone to experience the best performance without any limitationsespecially with superfast speeds up to times faster for just at mbps or at gbps from the samsung to the vivo pro the speed of browsing the internet has improved significantly today faster speeds can provide more convenience by cutting down wasted timewhether its loading downloading uploading creating content programming or rendering its like traveling from home to work or across the worldriding motorcycle versus taking train or driving car versus flying plane the more time you save on the journey the more time you have to enjoy the destination are you really okay with settling for slower speeds
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,routers speed httpswwwgooglecomsearchclientmsandroidtranssionscaesvab more the speed difference simply doesnt matter to me dont use my phone for anything where it would show big enough difference anyways there will be an infinix note with and note pro with so just wait for those or get phone from another brand or an older infinix there are countless options and thats all this is about options the note pro already offers ton of features including newer android version that the realme does not but the realme has faster soc and people can choose the device that has more features that are important specifically for them between said realme device and this infinix id go for the infinix but ill get neither because im waiting for the note pro because that will likely have periscope camera
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,euro and us prices cool but this is phone it has bette more routers speed httpswwwgooglecomsearchclientmsandroidtranssionscaesvabdeddbacsudmtbsrimgczivizmhyyswfhyfgjpaiaqgentestinternetspeedsaxvedahukewiaxcholyemaxvjrmwghblckiquiibegqilbaabiwbihdpr youre kidding still stuck on network speed you must see reddit experience network speed httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecommentshannygigabitinternetisagamechangerrdt
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,deleted post euro and us prices cool but this is phone it has better build quality better cameras where the ultrawide camera doubles as the macro as well bigger battery faster wired charging has wireless charging with magnets while the realme has no wireless charging at all additionally it has heart rate sensor and an spo sensor on the back which could be features that you can get with smartwatch but not everyone wantsneeds such product the helio gg are the same chipsets yes but they are enough for everything but gaming sure they dont have but not everyone needs im currently using phone with snapdragon gen obviously that has but have it turned off is perfectly fine for me
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,auxiliary lens making phone badits will be macro camera not macro camera more the infinix note pro with the socalled helio ultimate is nothing more than recycled budget phone that doesnt even deserve to be called smartphone with gb ram and gb storage its priced between in the european market yet it sells for just in indonesia that alone should tell you everything about its actual value httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphonediff know quality smartphones when see them and this is far from one the european and uk markets are far better suited for midtohighend chinese brands like xiaomi vivo and realme rather than bottomtier brands like infinix tecno or itel which are dirt cheap in southeast asia but somehow overpriced in europe if you want truly worth it phone look no further than the realme this device packs last years highend midrange specs at price that makes sense for the european marketaround if youre willing to spend just more than the infinix youll experience premiumlevel phone with better performance connectivity and wifi capable of speeds between mbps compared to the submbps speeds of outdated refresh rate hz is gimmickly for few seconds refresh rate hz is real scrolling experience bottom line the realme actually delivers highend features while the infinix note pro is nothing but lowbudget device pretending to be something more
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,glass front aluminum frame what about the dangers point about the back if it from plastic
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,specs sound pretty good design looks cool and similar to the ultra and then helio infinix gotta choose much better chipset for the one
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,since the thread has been quite heating up ill maybe speak word once again for you more hello you from indonesian thats the price for southeast asia in europe and the uk its over what joke and lets talk about the helio when it first launched its antutu score was but now with antutu it magically jumps to so after two years instead of performance degrading it somehow improves yeah thats what call scam and this pathetic phonethe firstever android device to remove the microsd slot so is the infinix note pro worth it the answer is obvious overpriced garbage they just repackaged twoyearold product slapped on massive battery and fast charging and called it day but when you actually use it daily it doesnt live up to the hype classic baitandswitch this is nothing but an entrylevel device loaded with gimmicky specs the only thing can actually praise infinix for is the camera which ill admit is almost on par with the samsung other than that ewaste
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,and you are stressing out too much over euro phone calm down bro customers have rights more know right but the fact that some people here are dumb enough to believe the euro price tag is beyond hilarious they are ready to forgive and forget everything because they think its costs bucks when here in england brand new infinix note pro still costs around pounds and the price was pounds when it was release the first time back in april last year but then again we all can agree that most of these people that are defending infinix herewont really buy the actual product rather they are only here to debate as if it is some social media sitemaybe they dont have enough friends on facebook lol
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,overpriced at eur what did you expect snapdragon elite with headphone jacks an sd more and you are stressing out too much over euro phone calm down bro customers have rights to critisize brand that dont seem to do justice to the amount of money it is asking as price and remember the phone hasnt been released yet in most countries the current euro price tag is just given by gsmarena themselves its not the official price by any means besides there is good chance the official price could be significantly higher note pro was intially estimated to cost around euro toobut later on the price went over euros in many countries and as far as the features are concerned people were right to critisize itbecause pro is basically offering the same features as redmi note and redmi costs cheaper lets not forget infinix lured in lot of customers using value for money as motto but now they are moving away from it shamelessly at least brands like xiaomi and realme waited for years before ditching the value for money principles infinix on the other is not even waiting half of that timeit shows how greedy they have gotten note made them popular year later they launched note and its price was significantly higher despite offering the same specifications the only notable difference was the amoled display but then again xiaomi are offering amoled to their non pro models and are cheaper there is basically no reason to defend infinix any longer as even samsung is now offering better at this price range
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,better to choose unisoc former than this very weak and overpriced try nubia more bro is shamelessly recommending blocked cpu for people to buy unisoc you think unisoc is for all possible users including developers who want super user accessroot think again before recommending unisoc mediatek is better
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,overpriced but not have microsd slot overpriced at eur what did you expect snapdragon elite with headphone jacks an sd card slot gb of ram and tb storage
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,has to be the worst looking camera island ever
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,antutu is scam look phone entry level old antutu version growth up to antutu version doesnt matter the and arent weak chipsets
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,how is helio is weak chipset it has around antutu score and for budget chips more antutu is scam look phone entry level old antutu version growth up to antutu version
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,abdulkadiran mar atleast pro will be no still sadly
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,helio there are dimensity they can use why the recycled helio when did it come out or or more years ago why still using it might be lot of unused so need to recycle
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,four cameras and only two are real lmao its not fourits three because one of them is heart rate sensor
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,atleast pro will be
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,helio is very weak how is helio is weak chipset it has around antutu score and for budget chipset is more than enough
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,all of that specs and its only please tell me its joke can you guys tell me what is wrong with like is not without you cant use internet
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,how does helio ultimate compare to snapdragon currently have xiaomi redmi with more go for infinix zero better option
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,why there are so many people complain about this phone it doesnt have etc like guys more agree with you
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,infinix must cut ties with jbl nothing good came out of this collaboration its only increasi more agree sir my sister has note pro it speaker sounds worse than my redmi note
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,and now nothing much to expect but the good thing is in its price range more is the best support video malig gpu and better fps in game
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,guys wait for pro it is they want to keep the series budget friendly why so mad
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,they should make this phone with network connection itd be disappointing if it more am very very disappointed with this phone why is it only in in fact we will boycott this phone if they bring only
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,they are circling around dimensity and
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,dawg for its steal its already released in indonesia my lord this phone it more does it have ir blaster
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,like the color options display design wallpapers manufacturers are now abandoning apple triangle camera design to samsung lens setup like vivo itel infinix and others
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,maybe but they didnt do anything like that here like the color options display design wallpapers
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,they wanted to copy samsungs best selling phones galaxy ultra maybe but they didnt do anything like that here
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,no infinix sucks there is something called patince
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,hmmmi think after around six months or year they gonna introduce new infinix note pro plus gwith everything that more better also more expensiveas usual marketing strategy
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,another comment because was confused why is the release date says exp april more yes thats right as part of marketing strat
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,they should give ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and more better cameras and camera sensors fo more no any reason for that otherwise price will increase another
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,samsung should buy the series they absolutely shouldnt do such thing they could only ruin it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,im using note pro can swamp my pro and get the pro have infinix note pro so need to swap can swap it with and where can find your office
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,everything good but the week this phone is still soc mediatek refresh helio agreed
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,but tecno camon pro has fps yes tecno camon is better in cameras but at more cost
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,omg im using note pro can swamp my pro and get the pro
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,flat screen is much better than curved screen yes curved screens used to be luxury on galaxy ages
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,honestly would say love this phone because first of all im typing here with my infinix hot pro and the experience is quite alright the battery lasts pretty long and it barely overheats when im playing honkai star rail the only problem had with this phone is only the os which is so painfully slow and restricted xos is terrible it runs on android and with xos its such waste of potential also the helio does not feel much different than regular helio not the ultimate but considering the fact that it has an elevator mode maybe its surprisingly good thing because sometimes just really need to get my internet back real quick whenever im out of the elevator but just couldnt because of the lack of signal on the elevator helio really gave out some really nice advantages if youre working in an area with lots of lift as way of transportation hate that the note pro series has the helio whether if its ultimate or not its still but really love the design they really gotta stop copying an already huge and renowned phone brand designs fr and the most thing liked is that they really set up new standard on their phones for now and then this one has an ultrawide camera for midrange phone and it uses the same camera sensor as the one samsung uses on their camera which is really really huge upgrade also xos looks good like cant lie it looks so clean know its just mimic of oneui and hyperos but they really did it their way it doesnt look much stupid anymore with all that bloatwares and all software problems xos is big upgrade and think they really read their customer reviews to be honest would definitely buy this phone if were to know it would be released but eh im stuck with this hot pro
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,atleast it has better os
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,apple andor samsung were removing the following features such as the headphone jack more seems like you know what was about to say cannot buy phone without those features you mentioned for that price cant be paying more for less and besides helio like how
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,ufs big
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,its midrange phone bro wdym for having better specs nah its probably lower midrange phone
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,still
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,mean this is infinix kingfinix
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,its very nice phone wish specs could be better its midrange phone bro wdym for having better specs
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,really cool feature rich phone nice one infinix
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,an actual ultrawide on entry level infinix is note gonna be having telephoto with the same price
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,as an infinix phone user for several years suggest the following the proximity sensor must never be wrong do not use the curved screen because it is bad expensive and impractical using macro camera is very necessary please vote for this comment if you like it thank you infinix
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,oh yeah im gonna sell my iphone now
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,gotta be the best infinix phone after the zero series why software improvement uw camera please bring it to the vanilla variant charging and software updates even though its only two years its already enough tbh and if you still dont want it well pick samsung or maybe redmi
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,the wallpaper is very not creative
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,we love you infinix but wait for the version and macro camera please
Infinix,Note 50 Pro 4G,looks like samsung ultra series nice looks really
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,maybe its about my phone dont think its common problem think it more its the camera and damascus frame that made this phone quite expensive it could go years with heavy usage and it will still looked like you just recently bought it sucks it had nongorilla glass some people speculate it uses gorilla but no it does not at all
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,only major updates thats doa
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,unfortunately the infinix note pro is not available in indonesia
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,no but will buy the phone and now iam afraid because of you problem about random restart maybe its about my phone dont think its common problem think its one of the cheapest zoom camera phone in the market right now if you wanna buy because of zoom camera you can buy very fast and no lag but if you not gonna use zoom you can check other phones because this is what makes the price expensive think
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,was about to say this that app is very annoying you could use adb to uninstall it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,it wouldve been the perfect phone if it had ip microsd slot mm jack bigger more infinix phone hardly ever overheat thats samsung and iphone thing
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,have samsung as gm ram gb rom this is the top of series its been years since more it can however youre gonna have to deal with bloatware and ads
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,so your actually saying you stick to one phone till the software update it over yes lot of people do it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,infinix please make phone like this same cpu performance but please inch screen and usb more just buy tv
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,no do you have the same problem whats the problem of infinix
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,do you find fix no do you have the same problem
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,phone restart randomly anyone knows how to fix this issue do you find fix
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,ultra is better what drugs are really on
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,im considering purchasing the infinix note pro plus and have specific question regarding its call quality does this device include dedicated noise cancellation microphone for voice calls if so how effective is it in noisy environments such as offices hospitals or outdoor settings your insights would be greatly appreciated especially regarding realworld performance thank you in advance
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,nah tecno pova ultra is better hahahahaha what drugs are you on
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,bring usb for display output on infinix phones like this one plzz
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,promise to my self this year will surely buy this beast all need is the performance more
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this phone not realese in indonesia please realese this phone to my country we need this pho more note pro doesnt release on indonesia just buy gt pro same performance
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,just buy gt pro same performance but this has better camera periscope and sony imx
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,yep lets normalize these kinds of phone that dont offer corning gorilla glass in more infinix didnt say it didnt have corning gorilla glass just because it isnt written in the specs here doesnt mean it doesnt have gorilla glass protection
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,years of android upgrades is too little it should be years of android upgrades this is more so your actually saying you stick to one phone till the software update it over
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,release date for india when it is available in india please tell me
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,bro its ur fault not infinix lmao in fact you should never own phone ever again since ur more yep lets normalize these kinds of phone that dont offer corning gorilla glass in this thing is considerably expensive over gt pro and even that has gorilla its not even phones from decades ago have these protections on their screen so why cant infinix get those with their own inbrand flagship series what an absolute regard lol
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,yrs os support does not really matter if you are just going to sell it after year of using more years of android upgrades is too little it should be years of android upgrades this is the biggest problem that makes us go to samsung
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,silcon carbon yep
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this phone seems to be missing model like ive seen for most new phones any particu more its infinix wdy expect
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,juast brought this phonei didnt like itthe battery didnt last just wasted my money hey mean the battery life might not be great even tho it is good for me also you cant really expect flagship features from dollar phone because have used this phone for week and it has some great feutres which most phones may not have in its price range because you are getting wireless and bypass charging and this phone has some feutres from flagship phones and you cant deny it because this is mostly considered as an uppermidrange smartphone
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,need help every time use an app for while it ceases and if it doesnt do that if scroll up it closes the app not minimize closes its so annoying and if you use this phone too do experience this or any other issue
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,please can the battery reach days if its fully charged people someone should bail more days even other phone can survive just dont use it for days and boooomm it will survive the rd days
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,have this phone for week now and its such beast wuwa stayed consistent at the highest setting even after hours of play time all bloatwares can be disabled too unlike on my previous phone where the buttons are greyed out no regret at all choosing this over the other budget phones hate how low their free phone case quality is tho you cant even hold it at the side without accidentally powering the phone off or maxing out the volume
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,they dont know how to optimize the os yet revenues this phone is target to oth more wdym optimize every android phone is already optimize if you worship apple then you dont belong here
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,from where did you buy it is it available in europe will like to know too waiting for response
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,everything perfect except that power button on the other side from where did you buy it is it available in europe
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,no yes it can last for days with moderate use
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this phone volume button is so soft even its locked and if accidentally touch or not it effects volume and mute by itself
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,where it buy in lahore pakistan dont now
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,can the battery last for days yes or no no
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,please how good is the battery of this phone an answer please because am planning to buy it it is actually great for normal everyday usage whether its for gaming video calling or messaging what it still lacks though is picture enhancements
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,in this difficult time we need phones with high specifications and reasonable price thank you infinix
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,can someone advice about their battery condition pls either isit will too hot like xiaomi wh more their battery is cool but software is the priblem
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,idk if its me but its that infinix do be upgrading over the years remember infinix hot play being hot garbage and there we have the note but yeah it lacks some stuff think
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,no glass protection big
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,roughly for helio device is infinix serious at all lol are you referring to the infinix note this one has not check the specs of the phone before saying anything
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,the connection internet is have problem but my area is already gbefore use gt pro not more just change the band frequency
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,the biggest question is when is infinix going to get rid of that dreaded palm store app the more was about to say this that app is very annoying
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,rgb notification light on the back how can there be rgb at the back of this phone its not visible
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,note pro plus look is better
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,ugly design
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,wan this phone pls give me
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,why the battery life so poor why they dropped sd card slot and mm jack they had it more they dont know how to optimize the os yet revenues this phone is target to other kind of customers this phone is an aggressive marketing like xiaomi did years ago
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,why do you need headphone jack when you can basically use the type port to plug whatever hea more why would he not want to type port should be exclusive to charging and data transfers not for audio stuff that will add more strain to it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,are yall okay with the only yrs os support yrs security updates of this phone more majority usually sell their phones before they turn years old lol its also cheaper to just resell old stuff then add few to buy new one at least in asia where silly tariffs dont exist
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,the back and that one camera thing on the island is so ahhh like seriously if put good processor then atleast make the phone look good its not that that hard bruh
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,they should release for gb version
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,hi when will it be available in kenya when we by it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,would consider this if it wasnt the taller ratio higher than looks like remote control
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,nits only hbm more than but is average for the class ultra cost twice this phone and hbm is nits pro has hbm nits think the nits on note pro plus is regular
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,its missing an ip rating military rating jack larger battery at least other th more mah sic liion battery is already enough why do we need mah almost all upper midrange phones do not have mm jack so try getting used to it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,nice but infinix not focusing on camera and video quality bro looks on video comparasion
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,only two things infinix not pro plus think must be install in device one is ip and nd is memory then it was awesome
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,does it worth it because the look is so good and it gives ultras vibe yes its year update but its better than xiaomi with ads running despite you not playing any apps fr
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,midrange mediatek socs arent the most energy efficient have used the and ch more comparing series to series is now off topic fr the difference is mid range vs flagship yes its not efficient as series becuase its flagship
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this or tecno camon premier which one should buy and im user of infinix tell me ab more if you want buy now infinix and it is nice and remember tecno will be late may to months later or later
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,should buy this phone or vivo iqoo neo pro good phone if ure looking for midhigh
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,finally infinix did it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,amazing midrange overall all it needs is longer software support and better ui to be truly more completly agree with you
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,will it have curved screen you already already saw the image how do you not know
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this or realme ultra depends pu got little bit better ui and longer software support however its camera is let down and uses older slower storage type compared to note pro ufs vs ufs so if you dont care about better ui and longer software support and you want good camera faster storage and for all rounder suggest you getting the note pro if the opposite then ultra or maybe just wait for newer phones sooner
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this gets trophy for the ugliest camera bump design of the year yeah picture of you in the phones storage would be even uglier
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,the storage must be also screen protection like gorilla glasses
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,al mar what tiny battery no it is big enough this tech has max kmah battery but this is okay for somone under budget
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,any idea when will this be launched in india waiting for this one looks everythings perfect
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,that tiny battery tho what tiny battery
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,compared to the competition especially in the year where ah is the norm sure but battery life matters more than battery size and that has generally been awesome on infinix devices even with less than mah batteries
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,tiny battery compared to the competition especially in the year where ah is the norm
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,deleted post my comment was just question because definitely disagree with mah being small especially since this is infinix ive got zero ultra which only has mah battery and that could easily last days and could outlast phones with much bigger batteries
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,still good though
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,display should have given at least if not
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,id wait or yrs to see if they fix the software and improve the material being used more then this phones will never be cheap anymore
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,charging wired in min wireless magcharge charging revolution in version ive booked my offer
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,ima game with hz and also be able to reach that hopefully plus periscopic camera
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,gonna be the best budget phone ever eating tecno alive
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,zero updates from my tecno well what phone are you using
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,will it support fps or not
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,my only one concern will it support pubg fps infinix gt pro had ultimate and its gaming phone with fps
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,either youre ragebaiting impatient or you bought phone that already reached the limit more know about my phone more than its less than year old since launch and didnt get even security patch more than months
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,camera score on nano review lmao still have bad sensor you dont even know how to use nanoreview if you see red asterisk it means that its not confirmed and is still being tested now its raised to and is still not confirmed
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,eur below phone that is better ultrapro iqoo neo iqoo turbo plus iqoo neo more availability is important too
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,use tecno and got updates either youre ragebaiting impatient or you bought phone that already reached the limit of updates the phone can have do you even know that new updates for xos and hios take very long to be released in older phones most transsion phones execpt for camon series which got years only have years or even software updates so you dont even notice that the phone you have already reached the limit on how much updates it will receive
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,they have updates have used infinix for long time they have updates my brother uses samsu more zero updates from my tecno
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,dear infinix we need usb for display port
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,nanoreview is perfect to compare or check chipsets and their performance not so much for cameras check my message
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,lol all of them has an absolute dog cam and like in xiaomi you can see ads on the gallery app more cn rom doesnt have ads and in term of sensor they are still better
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,the camera bumps look slightly awful they should have just kept the wooow camera bump
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,brother the infinix priorities budget so using qualcomm processor is not option for mid rang more dont think so both mediatek and qualcomm have their own midranger linesup within respective price ranges
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,frankly the only complain from my side is about the absence of esim nothing else what do expect from under buck phone
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,no dedicated sd card slot no buy
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,tecno infinix itel has basically updates not just android one but security patches to they have updates have used infinix for long time they have updates my brother uses samsung and the other xiaomi to tell you the truth this other brands are not better than infinix
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,darlingyext doesnt know the current market price of mobile phones recycling more you arent paying for the chipset only
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,darling is someone who is definitely paid by infinix tell you all this fact is true the ga more im not getting paid by infinix im just happy customer who likes their newest product as well please stop spreading false information
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,please have look at the price of the device darlingyext doesnt know the current market price of mobile phones recycling price is scam
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,new competitor of upcoming tecno camon pro you mean camon premier
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this is too expensive for an infinix phone only for my predictions it might be differ from other regions
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,everything is fine other than the bugs in the xos no updates slow processing of the images once the internal memory is half or quarter full abnormal prices at launch then reducing the prices right after few weeks
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,android up to major upgrades xos what crpwhich means usually per more exactlyas had one of this brand before they never updated it ut was all propaganda to sell the phone and after that no support or update
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,an overpriced kitsch
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,aerospacegrade aluminum ip
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,looks like galaxy ultra had baby with idk
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,almost perfect wish it had ip never heard of chip assume its just rebranded more it will lounch under in india base variant and its to better then older
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,not reallyother chinese brands xioami for example charges lot of money for devices that more tecno infinix itel has basically updates not just android one but security patches to
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,camera optic ois selfie with wireless bypass charging euro only oh boy im really waiting its review this is what specs expect just waiting for os and camera review this thing will booming
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,if only this has gb variant im considering buying this
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,im wondering why all infinix phones including mid range and high end models support only gps is that typo or its true had very bad experience using google maps in an entry level infinix phone hot nfc model
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,lol you giving wrong information even the owner himself doesnt like the infinix not more not reallyother chinese brands xioami for example charges lot of money for devices that have only or years of software supportex xioami pad pro costs and only has years of software updates
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,looks promising software is the only weak point coulda use better sensor or bigger but guess its fine
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,the most recent android version that just went unsupported is android this device will go more the more you can delay that inevitable full end of support clock the better for some apps its way quicker android and are in the verge of getting their support axed by most app developers besides goverment or very important apps may require higher than that
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,on pro plus device in is such an eye sore please have look at the price of the device
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,software over hardware any day of the week phone with outdated hardware may las more the most recent android version that just went unsupported is android this device will go up to android and will likely have at least years before that version of android goes unsupported
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,its appears to me the startups brands always leaks good software support therefore they should go with snapdragon coze snapdragon got wider driver and well optimize over other processor around its easy for devs to build their kernel for snap
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,but major android updates only that sucks they could at least give yrs os support you get what you pay for get samsung or something else if you want updates
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,its the same software on both series and havent experienced issues with my note more lol you giving wrong information even the owner himself doesnt like the infinix note series expensive for software year
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,hardware over software any day of the week phone with outdated software can last one with more software over hardware any day of the week phone with outdated hardware may last one with outdated software wont be able to look what happened to old redmi or chinese phones running old android with barely existing update policies it cant even install youtube or some games because of old android version despite the fact the hardware itself is capable
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,so what chipset will the next infinix zero use hope mediatek dimensity ultimate we dont want to buy last years trash chipset rebranding will waiting infinix zero its like samsung when in korea they released one ui while globally they had to wait months to have one ui already know that the strategy of good features and stable software will only be launched in the next few months so that customers will be disappointed buying the trash note pro
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,too many future in dollars phone
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,ok my choice earlier was not about cheap phones but infinix phones with better software infini more its the same software on both series and havent experienced issues with my note pro and neither did another person that know with such phone
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,im happy for you that you can buy phone thats much older than this and is also more ok my choice earlier was not about cheap phones but infinix phones with better software infinix zero have seen costumer complaints about the bad infinix note series
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,still getting the same screen same os same wired charging speed although wireless seems good their magpower would still thermal throttle and slow the charge the rear cameras got upgraded yes but the front is still the same from the old npg it will be best if they took the mp from the zero series speakers didnt get an upgrade or highlighted so it will be the same experience like the cheetah chip they got overall if you just hate the slowness of the npg due to its powervr gpuand the expensive screen protectorsget this one if the price is the same or go to other brands although the halo light gotten smaller from circle to rectangle but more useful also the flash got downgraded to leds instead of leds
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,ambassador of infinix note pro wkwkwk overprice not worth it at this price in my more bro this uses metal body and glass backdoor and an antutu score of million and has mp ois periscope camera and optical zoom and digital zoom come on
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,infinix first ufs phone
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,please give more ram and storage option the max gb ram excluding virtual ram and the max storage should be tb and more powerful chipset mediatek series
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this phone spec is great thats for sure its unfortunate this phone only got major android updates this makes me wander what spec infinix zero will have
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,lol infinix note pro under overprice but infinix zero only so infini more what do you mean by bad software how is infinix software bad justify your statement
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,from dimensity to dimensity is crazy software still mid but atleast it got alot be more anyway why it still got only major software updates
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,totally agree but its pity its only gigs and not fully water resistance no gb internal aww mann
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,dont buy infinix note series ewaste phone waiting after month buy infinix zero tr more the only thing the zero can bring that would be better than this is the chipset maybe but looking at the zero from last year actually dont think so the new flagship series might just be the note pro devices either way dont need faster chipset than the one this has
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,the software skin is pretty dire and transsion quality control is sorely lacking not in my experience like their software as for their quality currently own phones from transsion both are around years old and there are other infinix devices in my family and they have no issues with them
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,can anyone tell me after one has tested the total optical zoom and total digital zoom between this and the camon premier infinix has been getting more and more interesting since actually with their hot mah battery fully charged from zero to in just minutes
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,ignoring the far more crippled nonplus variant this was the moment infinix finally locked in more totally agree but its pity its only gigs and not fully water resistance
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,wowvery big improvements compared to predecessor
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,storage options isnt enough
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,now this is absolutely top tier huge periscope camera same size as the main even shame the more the software skin is pretty dire and transsion quality control is sorely lacking
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,they just keep making the camera bump uglier with each version
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,where do they put the rgb notification light tho
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,am curious about the price when it sells in my country last years note pro plus model sold for around and now its only and im not sure if they will sell for more than because thats for the zero model not the note
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,this isnt bad actually for what its worth its got lot of things locked down and im willing to overlook the lack of os updates if the price is right still its unfortunate that it doesnt have gorilla glass protection competent ultrawide camera and some hdr to make video playback bit more enjoyable wouldve been fine if they sacrificed the ois periscope for nonstabilized regular telephoto wireless charging and aluminium frame to achieve this
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,infinix finally cooked this time without messing up the recipe
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,hevc mar top tier until you realise how many updates its getting hardware over software any day of the week phone with outdated software can last one with outdated hardware wont be able to
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,quite the upgrade over last years model but guess that also means an upgrade in price yeah but its also lot better than last years zero series flagship the zero
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,if it had os years and security os updates man would buy it
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,definitely buying this
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,guess this is camon premier alternative infinix version sure it aint camera phone though they both have the dimensity
Infinix,Note 50 Pro+,one step closer to proper flagship from infinix not bad
Infinix,Note 50s,fps in both camera lol
Infinix,Note 50s,hdr sopot no hdr support
Infinix,Note 50s,cheap looking curved display slim and thin bezels amoled dimensity cheap the camera look ugly other than that this phone is pretty good deal breaker
Infinix,Note 50s,the batterys life is actually mah
Infinix,Note 50s,nfc not working this phon
Infinix,Note 50s,battery capacity is very low you should recover in next update
Infinix,Note 50s,mid spec for cheap price you get dimensity which can score up to on antutu how more the is midranger chipset also the phone has rather now outdated small battery on the other hand iqoo rose the stake by using the sg and rather large mah battery with the same price
Infinix,Note 50s,remember the snapdragon with little ram and storage in this case it is also like the uni more uhm no dimensity sits below scores over while scores above even and only supports hz while supports hz
Infinix,Note 50s,so whats the point for the scent if its only last for up to half year the spec is very mid more mid spec for cheap price you get dimensity which can score up to on antutu how is that cheap
Infinix,Note 50s,where are you from and does it have nfc really in morocco we have nfc in this model
Infinix,Note 50s,little correction this phone has nfc where are you from and does it have nfc really
Infinix,Note 50s,not available in philippines soon
Infinix,Note 50s,in indonesia baterai mah
Infinix,Note 50s,cost here for screen are curved and with nfc
Infinix,Note 50s,dc dimming and pwm dimming available on this phone since this phone has amoled let me know before get this phone
Infinix,Note 50s,no idea only someone with the phone in hands can confirm reviewers dont usually do suc more thanks atleast got reply from you tried asking in many youtube review channels but never got an answer am currently using infinix note it doesnt support raw just wanted to know before buying it
Infinix,Note 50s,they confirmed its sony imx how about the cameraapi level is it full or level
Infinix,Note 50s,what would be the camera api level
Infinix,Note 50s,this is great if really euro like it more than the other note due to the screen protection and cpu
Infinix,Note 50s,no nfc ir blaster on both cameras amoled hz
Infinix,Note 50s,good but ram cant get updated to android ram at least crapy brands
Infinix,Note 50s,ois camera would be good
Infinix,Note 50s,this is amoled curve screen and battery is mah
Infinix,Note 50x,does this support profiles or work profiles natively or through apps
Infinix,Note 50x,recently bought this device to give to my mom to replace her years old oppo well the is really good soc in this price it ran smooth very good power efficiency didnt heat up much and has decent gpu for gaming the phone itself is so so the os is okay no annoying battery drain and phising ads has micro sd card slot in hybrid has decent cameraat least better than the camera in my nubia the display still ould be seen under sunlight has bug at auto brightness that found on early android os the screen is badim ok with at inch but the color is greeny and washed out and they didnt even try with gallery and player apps in this phone the rest is as excatly like you can imagine from phone at this price
Infinix,Note 50x,leather back or plastic back or metal for gaming think better with out leather varians color when you use cooler fan for gaming
Infinix,Note 50x,its not mhz battery its comes with mhz battery its not mhz mate but mah
Infinix,Note 50x,honestly this is the best phone have ever owned it has everything need long lasting batt more same here ive been using infinix note since months no regret infinix has greatly improved its software and hardware wise this is the bare minimum for smooth experience good phone everything works great for the price
Infinix,Note 50x,only two major android updates the poco might be the better deal in this case since youll end up having to get new phone after two years anyway the poco also costs less than the infinix note in india and it comes with snapdragon gen which isnt far behind whats in this phone and if the historical trend continued its also better than this phone at certain tasks like emulation
Infinix,Note 50x,please launch in pakistan we need gaming phone in low budget there is no option available in more you could import from india and then you will have it india pakistan did not separate by ocean because that nations were located in the same continent if you had access to carmotorcycle so you drive to india then you bought it
Infinix,Note 50x,cry as if have this device and as if ur using itsamsung user why shud poke here go to ur forum and cry on ur problems dude
Infinix,Note 50x,awesome phone got it yesterdaymetallic finish frame ir blaster awesome battery superb display superb chipwonderfull phone
Infinix,Note 50x,
Infinix,Note 50x,anyone knows the tecno version of this this one always sold out should consider tecno camon pro it has pretty good spec but gotta add some more on your budget
Infinix,Note 50x,how is its phone call quality is it as good as samsung sony
Infinix,Note 50x,nowadays use bluetooth earphone tbh uit could be used for bikers thosince using the bluetooth might not be good experience
Infinix,Note 50x,with affordable price is good but ir blaster depth camera halo light isfking useless ugly design bump camera
Infinix,Note 50x,indonesia release with gb rom and nfc confirmed
Infinix,Note 50x,has anyone tried to turn on the radio application on this phone ive tried listening to songs on this phone using type earphone and it worked but sadly the same type earphone cannot use to open the radio application it says the digital earphone cannot use as an antenna to listen to the radio
Infinix,Note 50x,its too tall and too wide
Infinix,Note 50x,looking at it the spec is like joke it offers midrange chip but an entry level screen and with only single snapper camera that should have made this phone cheap guess ill wait for the price when its available here and gonna compare it to the pova curve
Infinix,Note 50x,nfc working or not in infinix note im struggling to setup the nfc system added my card but unable to pay
Infinix,Note 50x,is the specs accurate ive read that this phone has and no sd card slot yeah the specs are accurate it does have sd slot but uses shared sim so you cannot use sd card if you use two sim cards gb variant not available in my country think
Infinix,Note 50x,this vs note whats the difference aside from screen resolution and screen panel well for extra euro compared to this you will get for fhd curved led display for gb in base front cam back cam under display fp scent for months so like this with extra around euro is good deal for
Infinix,Note 50x,does this support automatic call recording without announcement like samsung yes you can record call like samsung
Infinix,Note 50x,well this is fine the cheapest is worth considering to play games if you don more yes also plan to buy it soon good to open app and game
Infinix,Note 50x,infinix note only uses resolution screen btw but it have other one model note have an amoled curve screen
Infinix,Note 50x,oled is for losers only but where is the audio jack nowadays use bluetooth earphone
Infinix,Note 50x,dimensity with ips lcd give infinix the crown now it have other one model infinix it have amoled curve screen same chipset with this one
Infinix,Note 50x,screen mirroring available or not
Infinix,Note 50x,display and no mm jack other than that all good for the price
Infinix,Note 50x,are they really putting two fake cameras and black space below like fake phones wow that more ir blaster and secondary camera think
Infinix,Note 50x,just the right phone with right specs and pricing for my need mtk good enough for everyday task and some light gaming and espicially with bypass charging military meaning internals are designed to withstand shocks considerably better than others that are not certified yet and ips lcd for its more durable than amoled in terms of burn in or shockand also it will be cheaper to replace if damaged all this considering the price of under usdconverted from indian pricing rs
Infinix,Note 50x,great with price great look great processer charge killledddd watt
Infinix,Note 50x,hevc mar everyone happy until they see the resolution and software support ending on android buddy the updates til android is way better than most phones though you are right with the there is still many phones that is slightly lower or slightly higher with better resolution
Infinix,Note 50x,is bypass charging useful or just myth yes it does have bycharging
Infinix,Note 50x,main cam sensor is jn
Infinix,Note 50x,everyone happy until they see the resolution and software support ending on android
Infinix,Note 50x,no amoled oled is for losers only but where is the audio jack
Infinix,Note 50x,oppo ax is best
Infinix,Note 50x,ok but where buy from canada or france
Infinix,Note 50x,according to gsmarena idk if the price changed its nearly so its pretty mu more usd on ebay right now go look
Infinix,Note 50x,according to india it has same price or little more hmm so cmf may has great value too prefer cmf for this price ngl
Infinix,Note 50x,total waste of money
Infinix,Note 50x,what about cmf phone according to gsmarena idk if the price changed its nearly so its pretty much double the price
Infinix,Note 50x,ultimate chip and camera and the price is lower than ofc they wont use amoled what about cmf phone
Infinix,Note 50x,no amoled
Infinix,Note 50x,yessome videos showing its hd onlythat prevented me from waiting for this oneotherwise everything was fine if not top notchactually should have bought the note instead of the note years backa battery replacement would do the job

Infinix,Note 7 Lite,everybody is just complaining it is well the phone is okay to me im really enjoying the dts installed in it for better sound its good phone overalleven the camera can be adjusted before taking pictures to mp mp mp for the back and mp for the front and so on
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,dont buy if you are in search of gaming phone
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,great phone the only downside is the front camera which is blurry dont buy this phone for gaming purposes cause its not designed for that you can even tell from the processor its using
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,infinix note lite
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,mine seems to have manufacturer defect keeps giving otg connection prompts lost the finger print sensor keeps charging even when not connected to charger ive have it for months now how the warranty will sort it out the most useless infinix phone ive even seen
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,new xos update can harm the system of the phone
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,pls nice phone but the camera is too bad can change it to another infinix phone since jux bought on th november at telefonica
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,hellow everyone have problem with my notch playing videosvideos are actually playing hal more use finger and swap left and right together
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,infinix should improve the camera quality of the phone
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,good experience was finding such secure device for long periodanyhow found security issue in this deviceplz update the version xosas there is an issue which interfsced on hiding our apps the hidden apps can easily be opened through app closer tap likeon closingshutting opened pages appsanybody can peep or retrieve and use the apps or pageswhere security lock is appliedthis issue should be fixed through upgrading version latesthopefully it should be noticed by infinix brand to develop and grow marketand compete other brands thanks
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,pls dont compare camera to hot lite hot selfie cam is blurry okay normally infinix is just normal phone but the lite versions of their phone is always nonsense its okay oo but there must always be something in the spec that will just make one to be afraid to buy it idk why do and also said plus cam selfie not cam selfie
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,good products like it
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,on launch in india in october this might break all established records on value for money most loved device common mens lowestmost earning peoples the only most affordable daily utility mobile etc parameters highly commendable effort by infinix
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,love phone design battery life and display when it comes to cameras im very disappointed especially the front cam also the back cam its quality isnt pleasing at all knowing that its mpgaming also not pleasing especially football games
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,they enjoy ruining reputation of phones just because they bought it for something thats more hey plz need advice
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,only downside ia resolution if infinix make it full hd it would be awesome
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,must anonymous comments on every phone how come he always have every phone been posted onlin more when you comment and you dont put in your nickname it will be named anonymus dont know if you are being sarcastic or notbut better be safe than sorry
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,loooove the phoneive used it since its launch here in kenya and the camera is more how is the batterycamera and performance overall
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,cant limit the number of users on my wifiwhy
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,true camera is not encouraging at all please what kind of charger was attached to the phone
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,pls have little problem with the flash light anytime turn it on and raise the phone it goes off any solution
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,with all the comment that have reed iam afraid to buy buy this phone but love it they enjoy ruining reputation of phones just because they bought it for something thats its not meant for or they bought fake also love the phone but most reviews on youtube are good can check them out freds tech club praiz techs
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,the phone was so nice really like it
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,impressing in use and processor is supportive in many ways that makes internet so faster than more waow the battery is encouraging aside that nice body structure
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,the smartphone is smooth in my hands
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,nice smartphone
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,see check very well perhaps hellio could be only for note of gb ram gb rom is not for note lite but note gb and gb ram has it
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,really the finger print sensor is really bad all finger print can open the phone
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,when ever charge my note lite charger and phone both heatup can any one tell me about th more my infinix note not lite does that too its nothing to worry about think its because of the fast charging when my ba is low and plug it to charge it heats up but when the is around the heating disappears
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,bro iskay fingerprint sensor kasa ha really
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,charging feature is very bad and in both using and plugin am presently experiencing the same problem too
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,it is scam not chipset its helio bought it few day ago see check very well perhaps hellio could be only for note of gb ram gb rom
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,anyone noticed blue light when charging can it be used as notification lightnote gb yes
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,are you nigerian and can you tell me about the battery and gaming too and where can get it more gaming performance of helio is not good if you dont use gfx tools like pgt pro guarantee you that it will lag in pubg no matter what anyone else says but if you use gfx it will at least become playable with fps dont know which phones are in your budget but if youre looking for gaming in this price look for these chipsets sd sd exynos helio or go with realme if possible it has helio which is even more powerful than sd sd helio kirin it doesnt have fingerprint sensor but its literally the cheapest gaming phone in the world so itll be best for you your last option is buying used iphone with small screen and battery dont remember which model but they sell very cheap and can play pubg better than most entry level phones
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,do you know if this phone has been lunched in any country bought one from jumiaksh imported thru jumia app its not badgood gamingphotosand power
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,im sure that infinix note is definitely coming with mediatek helio but guess the lite more it is scam not chipset its helio bought it few day ago
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,the battery and the camera is huge highlight of this device also love the inclusion of the helio processor good choice for phone of this range
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,its using helio in indonesia not to be honest they say its potato yeah helio is weak chipset you should go for standard infinix note which has helio best budget gaming chipset right now
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,too good to be true they come to indonesia with potatos chip helio
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,you right lite hav apr you right lite havp do you know if this phone has been lunched in any country
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,it is definitely viable option for budget oriented users like the fact that they used mp camera specs instead of mp or something that is usually used for budget range devices
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,infinix comp are designed by god but now are concentrate camera and processor then will god company in world in budget smartphone company
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,why not amoed screen
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,this comes with helio not only standard note have
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,it uses mt helio scored around in antutu benchmark thought it was that suck but compared to realme which scored around using is unreal
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,dear infinix an ultra wide camera would have done it nice phone though
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,it has version coming to egypt as well
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,tell me price of this phone
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,what batry mah charging oh nooooo come on infinix good spec but not for charging batry
Infinix,Note 7 Lite,the integration of the soc is good news for gamers more options mah battery is also great highlight of this smartphone ngl overall pretty good specs for budget smartphone

Infinix,Note 7,plz tell me we should go for it or nothow is its cameras working
Infinix,Note 7,congrats with your awardwinning article no one said you shouldnt enjoy your phone so more bruh who tf was talking to you continue your little argument that has stretched over month like two year old girls with the other guy and let me provide info to others rather than bicker like little females with an uncontrollable urge to get the last word you both need serious help psychologists are everywhere
Infinix,Note 7,the infinix note camera to me is extremely bad and the camera features earlier stated doesn more if its extremely bad can you suggest phone in same price with extremely better camera as far as ive checked its camera is better than honor lite redmi note realme all vivo phones in its range are you comparing its camera with premium phones or something you can also install gcam on it to improve its camera
Infinix,Note 7,is it note network is fast like hot play
Infinix,Note 7,just had my stolen and replaced it with the note in week of use dont think more which vivo
Infinix,Note 7,this not is great for it price thats am using now and am enjoying itone thing love about this phone is that it doesnt get heat always cooli recommend it for anyone who is infinix fun
Infinix,Note 7,note pro is the best phone have use so far but my question is dont if the phone is water resistant
Infinix,Note 7,but hiw much is thr orice if this when ut arrived ib the philippines
Infinix,Note 7,between the infinix note and huawei yprime which is better to purchase because im finding more which phone using right now using huawei for almost ll tell one thing for sure that is they ll never misbehave lag even for min but this time sold my huawei ys for infinix note really loving it recommend infinix over prime because for its big display fast charging loud voice side mounted finger print face unlock as fast as can think and powerful processes than and so many feature
Infinix,Note 7,the designcamera quality is superb battery last for hrs even when data connection is good more between the infinix note and huawei yprime which is better to purchase because im finding it hard to decide which to buy now
Infinix,Note 7,who told you it doesnt have hdr or the ultra wide angle it is obvious you havent seen the more ive seen it and am using it now
Infinix,Note 7,better camera how exactly the redmi note has ultrawide camera which is absent on the infi more who told you it doesnt have hdr or the ultra wide angle it is obvious you havent seen the phone not to talk of using it
Infinix,Note 7,baba is infinix note good phone to buy is the gaming experience good yes in pubg youll get stable fps on smooth ultra settings with pgt pro gfx tool youll get fps around fps in balanced graphics im talking about actual fps you get not frame rate settings it has virtual gyroscope which is quick enough to use in pubg the big screen lets you spot enemies before they see you other games like cod free fire are less heavy than pubg so they run very smooth as well if you want to play pubg on hd youll need snapdragon or similarly powerful chipset that can pull at least fps on hd fps has big impact on how good you play this phone can pull around fps on hd by default and around fps if you use pgt pro gfx tool
Infinix,Note 7,your arguments hold no weight the summary of your comment is havent done any research ab more baba is infinix note good phone to buy is the gaming experience good
Infinix,Note 7,how much different price in every country use google
Infinix,Note 7,super mobile
Infinix,Note 7,how much you can get gb variant for pkr at discount
Infinix,Note 7,aw love how you keep coming up with new excuses after being proven wrong in each comment more how much
Infinix,Note 7,lmao go read full redmi note review by gsmarena and compare it to other phones in its price more cry me an ocean aint gonna console fullgrown adult so go ahead purge your pains for someone who couldnt comprehend statement as simple as phones have features relative to their prices or youre expecting midrange phones to have flagshiplevel ultrawide cams you talk way too much all through this youve always shown yourself to be inept at comprehension but that that particular one showed how much of good student you are oh should google the meaning of ciao said the person who has said hes done talking on many occasions but kept coming back
Infinix,Note 7,my extraordinary tech knowledge you cant stop praising yourself can you all youve do more lmao go read full redmi note review by gsmarena and compare it to other phones in its price range it has worst review of all phones in its price even user reviews calling redmi note average phone is too optimistic of you are you sure you arent paid by xiaomi notice how youve been wrong about like things in all these arguments yet you never once said sorry was wrong or you are right you just try to argue about something else instead so petty
Infinix,Note 7,aw cute youve reached dead end xiaomi fanboy gsmarena review made it clear who was bias more petty insults said someone whose response from start to finish was filled with tirades blame yourself for your dislike for getting what you give
Infinix,Note 7,do you lack basic research skills researched about redmi note but gsmarena reviewed it on more my extraordinary tech knowledge you cant stop praising yourself can you all youve done is tooth your horns and nothing more delusions of grandeur reputable site gsmarena has reviewed rn with average rating point to similar about in or stay calm like said does any reputable site even review them you know that infinix has long been around before realme right but gsmarena reviews realme phones that alone says something
Infinix,Note 7,thought its just that youre naive boy its clear now that you lack basic comprehension more aw cute youve reached dead end xiaomi fanboy gsmarena review made it clear who was biased between you and me gave you full opportunity to prove me wrong by sharing technical facts if was wrong you could prove it any time with simple google search yet you couldnt provide single technical answer to anything said and then even gsmarena reached same conclusion as did is that the attitude of someone who is trying to help another person by ranting youre only good at throwing petty insults so keep that up thats your entire personality
Infinix,Note 7,why dont you provide link to review of infinix note by reputable website then do repu more do you lack basic research skills researched about redmi note but gsmarena reviewed it only today which you consider reputable source gsmarena said its worse than even what said according to gsmarena review was right about everything said about rn and read rn recent reviews even its users are reporting lag in games and facing connectivity issues didnt think it would lag at least researched about infinix note with same method used for rn actually even more carefully because my friend wanted to buy it thats how know its good my extraordinary tech knowledge you can find out its shortcomings camera quality performance battery etc by directly collecting information from its users on infinix note facebook telegram groups you can find out about its durabilityquality from durability tests but it only helps if you understand exactly how durable phone is normally thought note starts at in nigeria anyways if another nigerian is reading this comment if you can buy redmi note not note in same price as this phone you should easily choose note youll get much more powerful chipset camera less heating maybe battery timing and more
Infinix,Note 7,read gsmarena review of redmi note their opinion of redmi note is even worse than mine more why dont you provide link to review of infinix note by reputable website then do reputable websites even bother reviewing them lol infinix note in my country is redmi note is available for read it again not vanilla infinix note isnt just costlier its inferior
Infinix,Note 7,man arent you very knowledgeable lol mp vs mp is big difference to start with ev more your arguments hold no weight the summary of your comment is havent done any research about redmi note nor follow its community but still disagree will ignore your attempt at insults youre probably going through bad times you compared pixel camera to budget phone camera in an attempt to justify poor selfie camera of redmi note entire gsmarena community would laugh at you you think hdr algorithm of miui is enough to overcome the difference in details camera can capture when the difference in their aperture is as huge as aperture lens vs you tried to argue that redmi note ultra wide camera is more usefulworks better than iphone pro ultra wide camera was told about charging time of rn by rn owners on rn groups on facebook it charges in hours thats way more reliable than single potentially biasedpaid reputable source ive same ears as normal humans owned redmi note myself and tried infinix note as well dont hear the amazing difference in sound quality youre trying to force on us if you dont believe it grab your earphones and go compare them in real life infinix note launched in my country in april even earlier in other countries redmi note wasnt even announced back then and you can hardly find any reviews of it on youtube and other mobile platforms so yes its recent gsmarena reviewed it today and they gave it worst camera review in its price range already apologised for assuming you were smart enough to search same things about in whole heartedly accept my mistake you used ratio argument not me only told you how you can actually use it to compare phones my bad for trying to help you reviews like gsmarenas cant be understood by amateurs who dont know anything about technology used in smart phones because theyre relative to alternatives at that specific time price and their particular mobile market in the region for instance there are many clearly worse camera phones than rn in half price to which gsmarena gave better camera review than rn see good to know youre an exceptional case to summarise this entire argument youre too lazy to factcheck anything or even search simple things about the phone like you argue on gsmarena only for fun without any regard for wasting others money your ego lack of information can be judged by how proved you wrong over times and how you quietly quit talking on those topics but still carry on to spam these reviews
Infinix,Note 7,ni jun true confirmed this too was surprised tho in smartphones they use pixel binningsample down mp to mp its done to increase quality the actual mp pictures from phones arent good enough to use except for zoomingcropping
Infinix,Note 7,have check mobile harware with deroid info it shows back camera mp and front mp more true confirmed this too was surprised tho
Infinix,Note 7,please need someone to educate me on usb type that was told is not there in infinix note yes micro usb with watt charging takes about hours to charge its mah battery from around hours to charge from its the only real fast charging phone in this price other than nokia plus
Infinix,Note 7,google camera is working extremely good on infinix note have gb version not performance is good never lag play pubg on balance still no heating battery give or days screen is ok no complaints
Infinix,Note 7,small camera stop working automatically contact to nearest warranty center they said camera more dont understand your issue what do you mean by small camera what do you think its not working and how exactly did you test that its not working you should claim warranty at shop you bought it from youll only get reliable customer service from brands like samsung apple oneplus etc cheap phones brands like infinix xiaomi realme dont train their channel members in how to handle customer complaints so some retailers try to deny warranty if thats not possible youve to be firm about claiming warranty if they say its not included in warranty tell them to show you where its written and read carefully
Infinix,Note 7,please the camera app has disappeared from the menu and from the screen toohow can locate it you sure you didnt hide it in menu settings try restarting your phone
Infinix,Note 7,oh sorry to hear that your unit have this problem so early hope you get it fixed asap and more demand warranty even if they deny like had to with my redmi note mr cyberchum luckily his issue isnt major like mine was
Infinix,Note 7,deleted post despite infinix having high megapixel count and bigger battery youd definitely need as much luck as you could get good luck with your search
Infinix,Note 7,conclusion infinix note vs redmi note infinix note has better performance at worst more better camera how exactly the redmi note has ultrawide camera which is absent on the infinix the selfie camera has hdr which again is absent on the infinix oh its better because the selfie cam has megapixel more what an expert analysis better viewing angle and faster charging speed point to your sources infinix could have louder speaker audio but still have poor overall audio quality at the end of the day people listen to music more with earphones gsmarena tests show that rn and rn have great audio quality more than some costlier phones oh they should search for all those issues even durability test for redmi note but not for infinix note definitely not biased when infinix notes doesnt even come close to selling as much as redmi notes no surprises if fewer users complain about bugs online you know how percentage and ratio works right how many infinix notes have received android updates in the past they have virtually nonexistent software support but go ahead anonymous infinix marketing officer lol
Infinix,Note 7,lol just better display for redmi note and you wonder why someone said youre biased yes more its funny how quickly you stop talking about things proved you wrong about but still go on to make new arguments you lack self awareness already included infrared port ir blaster display and reverse charging in my initial comment which made your inner fanboy angry just because suggested better phone than redmi note in its price another cheap attempt from you of trying to change what said arent you too petty camera start by talking about extra poor selfie camera of redmi note its mp with apertures if you understood camera specs you would know because of its apertures rn camera cant capture good details and takes pretty bad pics if it doesnt get good light while infinix note has mp with apertures capable of capturing way more detail this also helps lot in low light as when noise removal algorithm is applied this extra detail helps retain enough detail in the pic which redmi note is physically incapable of it also supports gcam ultra wide camera is just optional secondary camera sensor main sensors are much more important most people dont even use ultra wide cameras because it ruins the pictures even in high end phones like iphone pro the edges appear stretched out flat my friend has it and we found it to be better to take few more steps back group photos instead of using its ultra wide camera can redmi note ultra wide do better than iphone pro software support infinix note os is perfectly fine and stable with android its software is more stablebug free than miui phones like redmi note even infinix note has developers working on roms for it check telegram and xda the entire reason miui phones have so many roms is because people realise how much miui sucks they get new bugs with every single update have poor performance and poor battery this is what forces miui users to flash different roms was one of them lastly even if your argument is more roms people wont flash roms because its troublesome and there are risks involved such as losing your phone for flashing wrong rom or because developer did poor job at rom or the developer can simply give to support for your phone after you flash it this is not point in favour of redmi note or is this where you draw the line of your biased argument gyro sensor infinix note has virtual gyroscope which is very fast accurate and works works with vr already tested research before you say things kid usb type type is not advantage over micro usb its an alternative especially when that type phone charges slower than the micro usb phone youre comparing it with and if people where you live mostly have micro usb phones type is big disadvantage for you because you cant charge your phone at somebodys house once again is it only not biasedsubjective when its in favour of your favourite brand oh is that right will get better lte speed if buy redmi note sitting where am or only in specific conditions that dont exist for any of us unless infinix note had slow speed problem and you can get better speed sitting on same spot your argument is invalid ok for ir it can be of use to some people yes people from various countries face weak signal reception issues in xiaomi phones dont know why youre not searching it xiaomi is literally famous for it if complaints on gsmarena arent enough for you go to xda telegram groups or facebook groups of xiaomi phones and argue with them instead of me and congrats on finding one of the many connection problems in xiaomi phones as per points in your own comment factor make redmi note better than infinix note factors make infinix note better than redmi note factors are subjective or only applicable in unexistent conditions if you disagree provide just as logical and technical argument against what said or you can only call me biased all of this tells us that you barely know anything about phones
Infinix,Note 7,you guys just de speak big big grammar plsis this phone nice and okquality and everything or more in phone
Infinix,Note 7,so now whats good is subjective what happened to that when you started arguing lmao cle more lol just better display for redmi note and you wonder why someone said youre biased yes you gave him your subjective opinion lte speed ultrawide camera gyro sensor device software support ir blaster widevine usb type etc if checked itd probably have better sunlight legibility and better audio quality mind you not just loudspeaker loudness all these factor in defining better phone but dont worry you werent biased after using nokia found ir blaster convenient for controlling electronics and tend to look out for that feature and know many that would prefer to have it if given the option and even those that would use it as tiebreaker such as theyd do with memory expansion and like ive said before dont experience any reception issues do most users from different countries have that issue theres reason for wifi dual band ghz is getting more and more congested and leading to more and more interference had seen user that once complained of poor wifi come to say that it only happens when hes using his wireless earbud and switching to ghz wifi fixed it
Infinix,Note 7,add in geroscope sesnosor is already present thought it was virtual gyroscope
Infinix,Note 7,oh you do those ones arent suffering from poor performances and reception thought all more so now whats good is subjective what happened to that when you started arguing lmao clearly told op if he wants better display go for redmi note and if he wants better performance battery go for infinix note and if rn is price of realme pro for rm pro aw of course theyve same issue like pocofone redmi note for what they offer in their price and how other phones compare to them its called getting value for money too difficult should dumb it down for you and explain in technical detail again the fact you tried to use this argument once again proves how little you know about android phones and thats exactly what meant by youre just arguing for the sake of your ego at this point you failed to answer even of my technical questions lol fyi sd of pocofone has similar performance to most sd phones and its good chance for you to confirm whether what said about xiaomi signal reception and battery is true or not you can read its reviews to confirm it it even heats up as much as normal phones that dont have cooling systems
Infinix,Note 7,honestly but get how he feels trying to convince others into that decision because of person more what exactly is my personal preference im not crazy about displays and ive repeatedly admitted and included this point in all my comments mr cyberchum just could not stand that recommended redmi note over infinix note but dared to highlight problems of redmi note other than that care about everything in phone be it camera performance heating quality battery endurance charging time and so on so what exactly do you mean by me being biased arent you the one basing everything on display the very definition of bias my friend also bought this phone and ive repeatedly asked him if thinks its display is bad or if hes disappointed with it he previously had samsung phone with inch super amoled fhd display if even he and just about everyone who bought this phone thinks infinix note display is fine then whats the problem and even if im biased in favour of my personal use at least everything said holds true for everyone who looks at performance battery charging time heating durability and stability in phone correct
Infinix,Note 7,huh love pocofone redmi note keep hating me for speaking facts lmao whi more oh you do those ones arent suffering from poor performances and reception thought all miui phones do dont tell me now that you dont mind those cons if youre intelligent enough youd know that my point was that good is subjective to someone who uses twoyear old phone infinix note wouldnt be good phone hope ive broken it down enough for your mind to grasp
Infinix,Note 7,forget display you dont even know anything about cameras higher resolution doesnt make more read before to comment said with fhd screen you can see the beauty of your images its not about camera but beauty you can even see indoor and outdoor your screen better its an answer to question of fast charging that note havent and repeat infinix have fast charging system since note pro they always adapting it to their batteries everybody doesnt buy phone to play pubgm play games in phones and know few resolution is better to increase processor performance it dont have to do some process if you want to use screen dont increase screen to its what you must understand
Infinix,Note 7,was able to buy these for rupees less total in black friday sale in america they di more for reference thats only and difference
Infinix,Note 7,from what saying if have all this tech why not play then on lower resolution the instead more was able to buy these for rupees less total in black friday sale in america they discount everything by for that day could of bought tvs for the before mentioned rupees less or of the ps for less it was common sense choice
Infinix,Note 7,careful now or the fanboy would call you fanboy allow him keep telling us of how good the more huh love pocofone redmi note keep hating me for speaking facts lmao while youre at it please tell me where can buy oneplus in price of infinix note
Infinix,Note 7,dude stop being bias ave used several infinix phones in fact started with infinix and for more if im biased and unethical try to prove it with technical knowledge not accusations mr cyberchum couldnt answer even of my questions yet he wants to act like smartass spoke in favour of redmi note over infinix note and yet he has problem with me all because highlighted its problems suggested better phone in same price lol regarding xiaomi quality how am biased when xiaomi has most quality complaints in this price bracket please explain how am biased when xiaomi type watt charging phones charge slower than watt charging phones do you call it low quality from xiaomi or simply fake specs of xiaomi how am biased when gave proof of xiaomi phones giving much lower performance than other brand phones despite having same chipsets and many times give even lower performance than weaker chipsets how am biased when xiaomi phone with mah battery has same battery endurance as mah battery phone from other brands how am biased when virtually all xiaomi phones have widely reported complaint for weak signal reception how am biased when xiaomi phones have most display issues in this price have bought more xiaomi phones than infinix phones fyi if anything should be biased in favour of xiaomi but facts are facts im not gonna make someone waste their money over my petty ego
Infinix,Note 7,the realme redmi redmi and redmi pro max have an antutu benchmark score of more from what saying if have all this tech why not play then on lower resolution the instead of using resolution tv for everything since said doesnt mean much
Infinix,Note 7,start by telling me how much more fps can helio pull compared to helio if you can more dude stop being bias ave used several infinix phones in fact started with infinix and for to say xiaomi is sub par product is unethical in so many ways
Infinix,Note 7,its okay for you to talkup the phone you like and exaggerate its qualities those who wish more it is good phone
Infinix,Note 7,are you done with leaving replies have your temper calmed or you still fuming only tec more youre the one who couldnt handle me pointing out flaws of xiaomi phones dont try to turn it round on me my comment wasnt in favour of any brand if you cant read english why even argue here op asked which phone is better told him aspects of both infinix note redmi note how is that drifting off the question is it because suggested phone thats way better than redmi note but is in same price is that seriously what youre angry about who made the rule that cant suggest better phones to people you or in your words you arent smart enough to do that its clear to me youre xiaomi fan boy or in your own words youre paid by them or doing free publicity ive same human eyes and ive seen what infinix note display looks like already said if youre obsessed with display sharpness maybe then you wont like its display if you scroll down here youll see many actual users of infinix note saying its display doesnt look bad are you trying to say theyre lying blind and stupid and we should listen to xiaomi fan boy instead no thanks youre more than just techdumb if youre still arguing about it some rn users youll find complaint for weak signal reception on almost every other page of xiaomi phones same for many others including performance heating battery etc eh nigeria why do you all nigerians suck up to xiaomi so much must research how xiaomi market itself to nigeria or are you same nigerian guy from before who coincidentally also bought rn ps naming lower priced phones with almost half of your phones specs doesnt help your argument it only makes your phone look worse for competing with cheap phones
Infinix,Note 7,ps gsmarena performance tests also proves what said about miui chipsets compare more its okay for you to talkup the phone you like and exaggerate its qualities those who wish to take your word for it would your cheap and ludicrous attempt to discredit other phones just to do that however is what it is cheap and ludicrous
Infinix,Note 7,my note battery is always running down fast even when am not using is it normal or there is factory error or what
Infinix,Note 7,an external stylus would be nice given the new update thanks
Infinix,Note 7,you really do like blowing silent horns to even imply that could have equal performance more ps gsmarena performance tests also proves what said about miui chipsets compare redmi note pro with realme on gsmarena see fps difference or any miui phone of your choice with realmenokiaother phones having same chipset
Infinix,Note 7,ill advise you to get redmi note because it has more components than note like the cornin more only thing youre right about is infrared port and reverse charging but only real advantage is in its display in my opinion never trust gorilla glass vs kind of specs all of these brands often use low quality gorilla glass making even gorilla glass scratch and break as easily as gorilla glass or lower only way to compare gorilla glass is to test it yourself or watch somebody else test it like gupta guy from youtube secondly gpu is only marginally more powerful than if it was helio gt then we could say it was better in practice its performance is same or lower than infinix note problem with miui phones is that they always give lower performance battery than other phones with same chipsets so you need much more powerful miui phone to consider it more powerful than infinix note heres how they compare rn with sd has similarlower performance than sd phones like asus zenfone max pro pocofone with sd has similar performance to some sd phones like nokia redmi note pro gives lower fps in games than realme despite having same chipset the same is in case of battery of miui phones redmi note battery would last less than infinix note also account for more ideal battery drain
Infinix,Note 7,to everyone questioning the display of this phone yes it is not or also and more yes if they add screen it will be on standard
Infinix,Note 7,do you understand the meaning of upgrade downgrade fast we start with chipset helio is more said note is downgrade because of secren and android system you cant have processor quad camera and take screen on it since note all infinx notes have screen with the note im in android when it was launch it came with oreo and still receive android security patch before and after note there is not infinix phone that can do it fast charging technology fct is in infinix notes since note pro note have fct upgrading is improving by addind or replacing some equipments and raise to higher standard still saying note is downgrade phone because its havent the scren that last note have you cant see the beauty of your quad camera pictures in it you cant enjoy full graphics of your games person who playing games in screen or plus will be agree with me
Infinix,Note 7,please help me which one should buy infinix note or redmi note ill advise you to get redmi note because it has more components than note like the corning gorilla glass against the corning gorilla glass on the infinix also redmi is also splash proof and has higher chipset than note which is mediatek vs mediatek on the note another feature is that it supports infrared while note dont and it has higher battery capacity than the note with reverse charging
Infinix,Note 7,please guys its june already has the phone been lunch in the nigeria market if yes how much does it cost am in madalla niger state waiting to hear from you guys
Infinix,Note 7,hey everyone want to buy infinix note need suggestions of your guys kindly be hone more its good phone use the net and battery last at least hours and above

Infinix,Note 7,the is the most selling point of this phone its so far the most powerful chipset from the more infinix note beats samsung in speed test check it out yaself
Infinix,Note 7,pick the note infinix the note xiaomi cuz the note is easier to break when acci more youre funny you consider infinix note to be stronger than redmi note the former doesnt have proper gorilla glass protection front and back while the latter has it compare their build again and correct yourself

Infinix,Note 7,hey plz may know how much infinix note with gb is at
Infinix,Note 7,yes there is mediatek yes quad camera but it is still downgrading phone after infinix more do you understand the meaning of upgrade downgrade fast we start with chipset helio is ranked no in level helio is ranked no in level battery is ma while note is note has fct fast charging technology note hasnt note has dts digital theatre system note hasnt note has mp lens with powerful gpu combining with cpu to produce stunning photos note has mp note wins only in resolution coz of full hd meaning it scores out of while note scores out of note gb variant still produces great videos coz of the added low light lens own this device call it gaming beast coz its very very fast hope you now have an idea
Infinix,Note 7,lol downgrade infinix note comes with helio which can score in antutu but thi more the is the most selling point of this phone its so far the most powerful chipset from the transsion holdings beats all chipsets by big margin thats why samsung was outshined by infinix note its very very powerful in speed performance gaming and lastly photography
Infinix,Note 7,type is the next big thing and infinix is far behind lol let me know when time for that next big thing arrives when it actually becomes better to buy type phones over micro usb phones as most people here have micro usb phones if you go to someones house with type phone youll be the one sitting with dead phone not us infinix kept its market in mind while choosing to use micro usb port and thats something to appreciate
Infinix,Note 7,june is already here do we have any confirmation on the launch of the awesome infinix note yet thats what im using the phone is just awesome
Infinix,Note 7,all are facts infact note beats camon premier with big margin when it comes to photogr more ive read everything and after all infinix still stands tall
Infinix,Note 7,plz suggest infinix note is come with gorella glass protection or not
Infinix,Note 7,helio has proven its capabilities through and through
Infinix,Note 7,on display fingerprint sensors are not good even premium priced phones with ondisplay finger more type is the next big thing and infinix is far behind
Infinix,Note 7,friends does anyone knows that how to create foldericon on home screen kindly help thanks try to search it on youtube so that you can easily get it
Infinix,Note 7,well infinix note is beast indeed as it is nicknamed its very sizable smart phone for gammers and movie freaks with the gigantic chipseti love infinix
Infinix,Note 7,no hd display pp no amoled screen common can do better dis usb am an infinix note fan as have use note and but am nt impressed with dis one
Infinix,Note 7,first it look goodand its so proudly to own that phone thats why compare with note like it
Infinix,Note 7,got one yesterday the picture and speaker quality is way below expectation yeah speaker quality is below expectations
Infinix,Note 7,note have lot of problems but mention major problems wifi is very weak contact more may you got the wrong model the variant have gb ram rom is beast excellent in all areas infact compared it with camon premier and to be honest it outshined camon premier in terms of video quality go for this variant on the side of audio no questions the digital theatre system makes it the best it has vidhance to correct any shaking during shooting with the help of helio its amazing
Infinix,Note 7,note is the best
Infinix,Note 7,to my understanding the phone is to be lunch by june how and where did you guys get the more it launched in pakistan few weeks ago my friend bought gb variant for he is quite happy with it hasnt installed gcam yet but says camera is fine no complaints about display signal reception speaker fingerprint either battery lasts days without gaming
Infinix,Note 7,not yet which mobile is best for pubg in that price rangy and that device will not leg in pubg mobile guide me plz any one
Infinix,Note 7,come on infinix please were in usb era no type boring
Infinix,Note 7,is infinix note pro out not yet
Infinix,Note 7,lags all the time
Infinix,Note 7,face unlock works but only for day finger print is also not that responsive
Infinix,Note 7,really want this mobilei like it and love it
Infinix,Note 7,really it is amazing phone want to buy this phone soon
Infinix,Note 7,why are your new products dont come with typec charger
Infinix,Note 7,at last infinix did it have now note and its super compered to its price have all what wanna in mobile its fast mobile great options
Infinix,Note 7,infinix note is an android one hone thats why recieve update the rest of all infinix doesnt im not really sure you know what youre saying bro can mention up to infinix phones that receives update of year or two after their production date even samsung itself rarely receives updates upto yrs after their production date rest my case
Infinix,Note 7,try washing your face lol
Infinix,Note 7,any one with infinix note got issue with his face unlock me with issue of stop working after more try washing your face
Infinix,Note 7,someone compared this transition device with xiaomi redmi note and forgetting to compare the more bro that was you who brought up rn we can see your ip address tag below your comment nu you came back to comment with newfake id dont think were stupid here must be bothering you badly if youre doing this also youre wrong in my country this phone with gb costs same as rn with gb so rn is officially outdated now its overpriced bad battery bad performance bad quality bad software bad speaker bad signal reception display problems slow charging all thats left for rn is sharper display and maybe bit better camera but we cant be sure about having better camera yet as infinix also supports gcam and its selfie camera has higher specs than rn just have to wait for suitable gcam for this phone and then compare
Infinix,Note 7,recently bought this mobile and after taking it home and using it for minute display tu more note is the best phone have ever come acrossit last me more than days with charge very fast when usingcamera its amazingi like it
Infinix,Note 7,dont be so sentimental bro im not really fan of infinix but im using one presently inf more infinix note is an android one hone thats why recieve update the rest of all infinix doesnt
Infinix,Note 7,have see the phone so cant say anything now why bro can you tell me how the phone is
Infinix,Note 7,what country are you bro have see the phone so cant say anything now
Infinix,Note 7,note since buy it from days and every day something new find in it its great more what country are you bro
Infinix,Note 7,all notes were full hd apart from note what shame infinix they will release note pro which will come with fhd and if we are lucky it will come with amoled as well
Infinix,Note 7,for now infinix note is the best phone in africa and asia infinix note can be used to com more hahahahaha nice joke
Infinix,Note 7,really good overall device love it but wifi connection is think somewhat low pick drop more it may be the particular wifi you are connected to or perhaps your particular device has factory issues must tell you that their devices are very good
Infinix,Note 7,anyone who compares infinix note and rn are not in their right mindredmi note outcla more dont be so sentimental bro im not really fan of infinix but im using one presently infinix note bought it on os received update and right now its on os dont say what you dont know
Infinix,Note 7,phone cant be called note phone without stylus pen the phone is nice but doesnt deserve to be called note phone cpu octacore ghz cortexa ghz cortexa wlan no wifi direct no type usb cable poor location of finger sensors no ip water resistance infinix please upgrade the new version note pro
Infinix,Note 7,anyone that assumes phone with qualcomm chipset is more battery efficient or powerful than more all are facts infact note beats camon premier with big margin when it comes to photography despite camon premier hooking mp lense didnt seem to work to its height due to the moderate chipset helio the video quality of note was the best compared to the premier during my tests so go for brand pixels laugh at urself at the end enjoy urself
Infinix,Note 7,inch with screen at that size it shouldve been at least if only this phone have screen and usb type it wouldve been perfect
Infinix,Note 7,its rare to find monitor with approximately ppi density or higher can tell you that more screen sze should be atleast minimum of infinix note dnt mnd reasonalble gd cmpny strt mke it if more than inch upto inchapprxmtebe welcome to buy by me at the frst to do so
Infinix,Note 7,for inches my monitor has more ppi than this think its rare to find monitor with approximately ppi density or higher can tell you that ppi for monitor is more than enough unless you are using the monitor at less than cm by ur eyes
Infinix,Note 7,the is more powerful than the sd exactly
Infinix,Note 7,aside from mah battery and mediocre and largely pointless macro camera on this phone how more infinix note is priced same as redmi note here do you think your little country nigeria is entire world rn was way overpriced in my country at the time of its release remember someone from nigeria asking me for advise year ago checked your countrys smartphone market and it sucks you dont even have any options in specs you literally buy the same phone but from different brands at very high prices felt sorry for him this also explains why you hate infinix note it suddenly diversified the concept of product line in nigeria and you cant adapt to this change you arent progressive anyways here it goes expect equally detailed technical response from you instead of the blabbering youve been doing if you cant dont even bother replying because wont entertain you further more powerful chipset infinix note gives fps in pubg with pgt pro redmi note gives around or less than fps same price but infinix note has gb ram gb storage redmi note has gb ram gb storage out of which only around gb was free when owned it same price but infinix note has ltps ips lcd you probably dont know these things so better explain its display has viewing angles than any other phone in this price why with inch screen its aimed at becoming perfect mini tv to watch with friends low resolution phones are usually only problem when you hold them close to your face same logic as tv so in this kind of use and at hand distance its display is actually more useful than rn you do compromise display but its not that big of compromise unless youre crazy about display resolution one problem with infinix note display is its visibility under sunlight redmi note also had this issue so thats irrelevant to your question same price but infinix note has android os and will be updated to newer android versions redmi note is still on android and even if it gets android itll be its last update fyi here no other phone comes with android in this price some are scheduled to get it but its unknown when camera you said infinix note has low mp sensor while stock camera of redmi note sucks even more ive used rn so know the colours of redmi note were are always wrong slowmo had lags pictures were unusable in lowlight and fps videos didnt even have fps it was fake only reason and other people like rn camera is due to google camera support which infinix note also has with mp back camera with apertures mp front camera with aperture both with full gcam support you can expect its camera to perform decently maybe not as good as rn but still good enough to replace it given other specs though selfie camera of infinix note is way more advanced and can easily outdo rn with the right gcam infinix note watt charging actually works in hours for mah battery redmi note takes hours to charge its mah battery proving that its fake which sucks because rn mah battery lasts as long as mah phones infinix note mah battery that can actually last days unlike rn mah battery which barely lasts day in pubg my redmi note would last hours some report even less battery endurance this is same as nokia plus with mah battery signal reception infinix note has stronger signal reception than redmi note in fact redmi note has complaint for weak signal reception same is the case for redmi note pro note pro its common problem in redmixiaomi phones less heating redmi note heats up too much in heavy use while infinix note doesnt os skin xos of redmi note is perfectly fine it doesnt slow down phones performance and doesnt use much battery you dont lose battery while sleeping either miui of redmi note is the entire reason its sd chipset performs worse than sd phones like asus zenfone max pro its also the reason behind why its mah battery lasts as long as mah battery phones miui is most famous in android community for bugsproblems for proof you can ready any redmi phone user forum regarding updates it only gets more issues with every update when sold my redmi note and many other users on gsmarena were forced to download launchers like evie and nova launcher because of bugs in miui the only advantage of miui is that its feature rich so you can decorate your home screenlauncher bit by compromising everything stated above what do you want more performance and battery while browsing facebookworkingplaying games or decorate your phone like little girl could go on but know you cant even understand what saying youre someone that cant tell his phone isnt working like its specs suggest even if you bought it redmi note could sell brick to you telling you its gold and youd buy it
Infinix,Note 7,how does this your subjective opinion invalidate what he said to many infinix note was wor more overpriced pathetic performance poor camera youre right definitely worth buying
Infinix,Note 7,more than year old redmi note is better that recently released infinix note here in nig more owned redmi note for month anyone that likes rn for any reason other than its camera should not have an opinion on phones its proof of how little you know about phones rn performance is lower than sd phones like asus zenfone max pro its around sd or lower infinix note has much superior performance rn battery is comparable to mah phones my honor lite which also owned at the time had better battery timing than rn both in gaming and normal use rn watt charging with type was slower than asus zenfone max pro watt charging with mirco usb or realme for that matter infinix note charges in hours proving that its watt charging actually works this is also my answer to your blabber about type are you suggesting infinix should intentionally sell type phone that goes against needs of the customer do you even know the concept of product line dont try to teach multinational company business when you know nothing about these things or phones for that matter you started talking like an idealistic in desperate attempt to counter my point about micro usb being more suitable in most of its targeted markets what does that tell you about yourself you need to fix your attitude ps you dont even know anything about type technology rn doesnt even support type completely which is why its watt type charging is as slow as micro usb watt charging youre this gullible and want to have an opinion on phones havent read rn reviews in year but im willing to bet youll find all of these complaints easily on its forum heating issue battery issue speaker issue display issue the very reason you quoted it here ironic performance issue these were all common year back too lol if youre okay with buying garbage quality phone that doesnt even work properly then go ahead and buy it but dont try to force your unintelligent opinions on us
Infinix,Note 7,gionee elife used way back in had fullhd display despite being only inches more definitely know more than you but must apologise for assuming you would be smart enough to understand what said that is no worthwhile budget phone has fhd display with these specs and is this what you do in your free time trying to pick fights on mobile forums
Infinix,Note 7,phone engineer or repairman can you tell me about power of helio compared to snapdragon the is more powerful than the sd
Infinix,Note 7,nope this is the first infinix phone worth buying how does this your subjective opinion invalidate what he said to many infinix note was worth buying too
Infinix,Note 7,please could you name some aside from mah battery and mediocre and largely pointless macro camera on this phone how is this better than redmi note dont even bother mentioning screen size because its already disadvantage to many few want something with such big footprint in their pockets most people that buy them are only putting up with them
Infinix,Note 7,how is type an improvement over micro usb it charges completely in hours in many cou more it was that way in all places at some time is it that you hate change or what if majority of people in your country share your mindset micro usb would still be common in your country for years to come
Infinix,Note 7,its not baffling infinix note is much superior to any realme redmi samsung huawei opp more more than year old redmi note is better that recently released infinix note here in nigeria lol the only pro is the mah battery nothing else
Infinix,Note 7,no budget phone has fhd display gionee elife used way back in had fullhd display despite being only inches what do you know lol last august bought redmi note for more than year after redmi note was released infinix announced phone with worse specs at higher price abysmal camera sensors which are practically only there to make up numbers and inches hd display with micro usb
Infinix,Note 7,desin is fantastic am waiting for review review
Infinix,Note 7,have seen the specs feel the great personally like the infinix note design its camera look is amazing
Infinix,Note 7,not going to happen by august they will release note prowait and see
Infinix,Note 7,no doubt the note is an improved set but ive issues with its display features note more why are you here all you care about is display while this phone offers all of the best specs other than display youre clearly lightweight android user who doesnt care about performance and other specs you want fhd amoled display in this price with these specs not gonna happen in go buy one of those helio phones that lags in apps like facebook youtube etc theyre the only ones thatll meet your display requirements
Infinix,Note 7,you know this bro am phone engineer for years and quite agree with review batter more phone engineer or repairman can you tell me about power of helio compared to snapdragon
Infinix,Note 7,baffling thing is people still by tecno and infinix when there are brands with way better valu more please could you name some
Infinix,Note 7,for the fact it did not come with type usb connector dont know they cant improve on th more how is type an improvement over micro usb it charges completely in hours in many countries including pakistan very few people use type phone as result if you go to friends house youll have trouble finding type cable because everyone owns micro usb phones
Infinix,Note 7,micro usb we are in what country are you from micro usb is more common in the countries this phone is targeted at if go to friends house ill have trouble charging my phone if it says type in pakistan
Infinix,Note 7,its sensor is unkonwn omnivision
Infinix,Note 7,what ive noticed is nowadays phone manufacturers release phones in kinds and from my analys more not going to happen
Infinix,Note 7,can play pubg with full gyro and is the gyro perfect or not phones without gyro sensor use data from other sensors to replicate gyro such as data from compass gravity sensor etc but this virtual gyro effect is slowhas delay so it doesnt work properly for games if you want gyroscope in pubg recommend realme nokia plus and realme pro otherwise this phone is really good for pubg
Infinix,Note 8,infinix note is great phone that is many people buy it but they dont what to lose it more how good is infinix note bg gb

Infinix,Note 8,yes infinix note is good phone been using my now in heavy usage and no problem please am very concerned about the camera before buy it please whos using the phone can please see unedited pictures from the front and back camera before buy it
Infinix,Note 8,pls is infinix note good phone be buy it about plus yes it is good phone you can say amazing too
Infinix,Note 8,okay where to start when you get this device the first thing that you notice is its massive screen and assure you it is gorgeous it is clear enough to see everything you need to see it is not bad screen the ergonomics are little off for me you get used to it but im not fan of the fingerprint lock button can have it off though but that defeats the convenience price is decent where am from the phone costs usd it was quite cheap and it was opening day for the kiosk in mall chain now on to the cake it boasts processor ive done my research and it is slightly faster than my previous device which was qualcomm snapdragon from it is fast and it is responsive but you can feel the processor lag because there are moments where the phone freezes because of too much processing required after heavy session of gaming it seldom does this but it lags those are rare though this device can render the middle settings of gta sa well but go beyond that and it shows as for emulation this phone is less than stellar youre better off with snapdragon for gaming its not bad the large screen is definitely helpful appreciate the existence of controller supported android games and am enjoying it so far would recommend this device for mid ranger its actually pretty good its alright if youre saving money and need good phone with good gaming capabilities this is it but the later models would improve on that especially the and ones
Infinix,Note 8,the possible worst ever device with very poor performance how so mean if you mean the occasional lag and it isnt capable of running higher end apps like genshin and the like can relate to you this device isnt the best but it isnt the worst either well as far as the phones have used are concerned this device can do many things but not everything the camera is not that bad but thats maybe because dont take pictures often
Infinix,Note 8,camera nonenonenonesingle camera origin mp pixel binding mp
Infinix,Note 8,so farso good it serves well
Infinix,Note 8,in specification shows that the phone have mp camera but the maximum support of helio is more please check the content of chipset first

Infinix,Note 8,plenty of bloating software and unnecessary adds appeared which are associated with companies software all adds appeared such stupid phone camera result is very low only hardware is upgraded which is useless

Infinix,Note 8,just so you know both infinixtecno and itel belongs to the same owner theyre also the more agree with you despite being same company but tecno have crashing problem and once it crash its done have been using infinix for years now but it never let me down its reliable phone stronger protected screen and long lasting batts

Infinix,Note 8,please which phone gat good game quality and camera quality combined wanna get one please help
Infinix,Note 8,please mine always have temperature rise cus the phone heats up anytime snap pics when und more expect system update soon to correct that problemtrust me
Infinix,Note 8,opinion infinix note or samsung as better buy realme xiaomi or huawei as is most battery efficient phone heats less good brightness for outdoors and its camera captures better colours dynamic range skin tones especially the back camera but its chipset is too weak for gaming display quality is much lower than realme xiaomi in terms of colour reproduction contrast infinix note has more powerful chipset suited for smooth gameplay but on low graphics camera captures better details but likely worse colours dynamic range white balance skin tones display brightness is likely lower but still acceptable if you want to enjoy games on high graphics aim for phone with at least snapdragon or better snapdragon or helio gt or kirin
Infinix,Note 8,nah make ur research wellg is new chip and is even slightly better than gwhy compar more youre correct but snapdragon is much better than helio helio gt is more powerful than snapdragon just less batteryheat efficient
Infinix,Note 8,please tell how you guyz find the camera result im confused whether go for note or re more lol bro if you can buy realme or even realme then you shouldnt buy this phone for camera realme is beast compared to this phone trust me ive checked almost all popular infinix phones their phones have high white balance problem making images colourless and noisy there are only few exceptions like infinix hot hot camera is very good for its price and like the other guy said even better than infinix note it also has slightly high white balance in selfie camera but not as much as other infinix phones
Infinix,Note 8,this is how the hyped note about the camera and went and bought itnow am regretting buying infinix note even hot camera is better than it the have brought out note now and start hyping the camerahow sure is the camera is it okay
Infinix,Note 8,plz is it good the phone is good enough swear
Infinix,Note 8,that is not true am not really fan of infinix but wouldnt agree with that comment at al more nah make ur research wellg is new chip and is even slightly better than gwhy compare it with helio that has benchmark of while is should be comparing the helio gt with not with gand to busrt ur bubbles the has slight better cpu and thermals than gt while the gt has slightly better gpug are in the same level with snap dragon not my broda
Infinix,Note 8,pls can tell me if note camera is good or should buy the as instead
Infinix,Note 8,two major issue faced in note were low display and fingerprintmy phone was unlocked even more its nice phone video
Infinix,Note 8,camera sensor used in infinix note samsungs or sonys anyone sony
Infinix,Note 8,wanted to go buy the but the review got from the phone aint goodplease how is the phon more the battery is mhzcan last up to day for busy phone and up to days for normal users suggest this for buy the cam is mpx which is outstanding for but the problem might be the sizeit does not fit well in small hands
Infinix,Note 8,better go and buy redmi note si bought mine for in nigeria it has gollila class bot more that is not true am not really fan of infinix but wouldnt agree with that comment at all its very wrong and the snap dragon is on the same level as mediatek hellio
Infinix,Note 8,please sell it at malaysia please
Infinix,Note 8,redmi note is slighty better in terms of function wanted to go buy the but the review got from the phone aint goodplease how is the phone battery especially the camerafront and back
Infinix,Note 8,very good phonebattarysound and size thanks infinix
Infinix,Note 8,galaxy note is better
Infinix,Note 8,please how nice is the phone is it very slim and is the camera bright and doesnt grooo more better go and buy redmi note si bought mine for in nigeria it has gollila class both front and backp resolution screenultra wild lens with snap dragon which is by far better than the helio search on google for the best mobile processor and see the ranking infinix gives less on their products and demand for high rate price while other brands offer more with little to take from uthe note is hahabut my redmi is far better than it
Infinix,Note 8,no ultrawide display mp macro seriously what are they doing charging euros when there are phones times better for the same price
Infinix,Note 8,its not dissapointing because this phone is only minor upgrade over note its more unless you own one you wouldnt know about its cameras my mp mode is literally useless even for cropping to downsize to mp photos and as far as remember the system should report mp sensor instead of mp or mp cant remember well sensor
Infinix,Note 8,mad phone
Infinix,Note 8,im affraid if gb memory is lpddr and that screem resolution are bad
Infinix,Note 8,slow memory how do you mean it has slow motion video features not slow memory
Infinix,Note 8,please is the resolution better on such big screen
Infinix,Note 8,correction it has slow mo slow memory how do you mean
Infinix,Note 8,the samsung galaxy hade about ppi this has ppi please do not use if you have to make it smaller so it is more ppi
Infinix,Note 8,highest video quality is no slow mo correction it has slow mo
Infinix,Note 8,want know about its camera functions does it supports recordings also want to know does more highest video quality is no slow mo
Infinix,Note 8,how was your experience so far with the phone does the phone has google lens yess
Infinix,Note 8,is note better than hot far better because infinix hot has gig rom while infinix note has gig rom and lot other features including fast charging battery
Infinix,Note 8,yeah agree with you even stupid mp camera was useless infinix never learn to give more its nice phone bought the gb variant some few days ago and its performance is wonderful particularly the battery which to me remain one of the best
Infinix,Note 8,available pakistan
Infinix,Note 8,this looks like terrible deal for bucks bought redmi note pro for this much money more yeah agree with you even stupid mp camera was useless infinix never learn to give ultrawide lens except zero
Infinix,Note 8,does this note have stylus pen no
Infinix,Note 8,is the selfie camera any good my sister wants phone in that range and selfies are legit all she cares about
Infinix,Note 8,how much yes its very much available in nigeria bought mine today for at slot outlet in yaba
Infinix,Note 8,me too oh pls do know of the price

Infinix,Note 8,buy higher price then love the phone
Infinix,Note 8,thats great inovetion good technology
Infinix,Note 8,infinix zero is way cooler than this note
Infinix,Note 8,infinix still have long way to go they need to understand that their competitors are xiaomi more screens drain less battery when the phones gpu doesnt work as hard its actually massive plus rather than negative
Infinix,Note 8,then pay for the higher end one its bucks for reason you can get the one with more for this phone price you can get realme ips at hz rr
Infinix,Note 8,how wish if they will gonna put useless cameras on the back they might as well just put cameras mp mp depth we dont need those other useless cameras they just fill out space on that big square already like the form factor and size of it really wish smartphone companies will stoo this kind of trend if they have removed the other useless cameras it could have saved them money im okay having cameras with screen this big cameras on the front but instead of investing the money on those useless cams they could have spent it to give us screen or maybe screen oled but nevertheless this phone is really timely specially this time of pandemic people needs budget phones now days kudos infinix for being generous with the storage and ram keep up also like that you gaved us option to hide your ads
Infinix,Note 8,this is some real tech trash good for kids
Infinix,Note 8,they are trying these days one day they will be up with the best

Infinix,Smart 10 HD,honestly same specs as smart giving it smart is diabolical
Infinix,Smart 10 HD,he smart hd is equipped with unisoc processor and has gb of ram and gb of storage expandable to tb using microsd card
Infinix,Smart 10 HD,gb ram feels illegal seems legit to me
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,never buy smart series just buy hot series if youre on very small budget hot series have huge problem of hanging and lagging
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,like was screaming mp front mp selfie in god hate infinix no way sherlock why would phone that is around dollars or even less than have mp infinix why go back to school to learn how quality affects price

Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,mp main camera hope im reading it wrong cause wt
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,google pixel at home
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,finally oneplus nord can afford
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,mp wtf this is first phone with mp ever seen
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,look this camara like google pixel
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,bro redmi is better than ts
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,nfc only for transfer files not for payment what is this weird restrictions plus the specs more hot did have helio its more an upmarket version of smart wouldnt be surprised if they used the same chip as smart but with ufs likely to be hot
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,this thing copied to early google pixel ahh camera
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,would go for itel city with full android
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,it looks good the camera layout is probably the most different nowadays its weak but for that price and that battery it will probably last long time
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,for the price im really impressed you get mah is great higher megapixel cou more phone is good but proceser is very chip lavel this two smart phone deserve sd gen or please
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,despite being copyi love the specs and the design at least we have flagship design at an afforadable price

Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,prefer the inclusion of ai features that the note series have with to euros price
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,interesting design they went for here
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,why have nfc and not allow it for payments so weird it is not good for customers
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,actually decent tbh better than redmi realme and even maybe itel city itel city has ufs
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,love the camera design
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,oneplus nord ahh back design
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,mp kfps is crazy work
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,phone with mah battery and an watt fast charging coupled with an ip and drop resistance of up to metres being sold at mere euros is really some thing and could nt ask for more but is it too much to ask for an ip ip ip for an euros
Infinix,Smart 10 Plus,google pixel ahh design
Infinix,Smart 10,is helio better or unisoc better the mediatek helio is generally considered slightly better than the unisoc for most tasks while both are budgetfriendly processors the helio offers marginally better overall experience especially in graphicsintensive tasks however the difference is not significant and the unisoc can still provide smooth experience for everyday use and some light gaming heres more detailed comparison gpu the helio features malig mp gpu while the uses malig singlecore in theory the gs dualcore malig should offer better graphics performance but in practice both will struggle with demanding games cpu both processors are octacore but the helio utilizes slightly different core configuration likely mix of cortexa and cortexa cores the exact clock speeds and core configurations can vary so performance can depend on the specific implementation in given phone performance the unisoc has been reported to show slightly better performance in some synthetic benchmarks but in realworld usage the difference is minimal gaming both processors are capable of handling popular mobile games like mobile legends and even pubg mobile at lower settings and frame rates ai the helio includes some ai capabilities for camera enhancements while the unisoc may not have the same level of ai features overall experience for most users the helio offers slightly more wellrounded experience especially if you prioritize gaming or camera performance the is still solid option for budget phones and offers good balance of performance and power efficiency in conclusion while the helio has slight edge the unisoc is very close competitor and good choice for budgetconscious buyers the specific performance of each processor can also vary slightly depending on the phone model its used in
Infinix,Smart 10,guys strongly advise you to spend more money and get better device purchased this phone and the simplest games are crashing its just waste of money bought it brand new for about and totally regret it now will sell it for and buy samsung

Infinix,Smart 10,honestly for im in

Infinix,Smart 7 HD,did you play pubg on the infinix smart hd regularly is it heating he is not playing efootball
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,of course the infinix smart hd is good phone the secret of the phone is just to do the sys more the phone specification is quite good most especially the charge capacity and display everything of it is nice except for the ram gb never expected such difference at first it hinders me from doing multitasking even when im in haste it load slowly or even hang for sometimes when mobile data is on im facing allot of issues with it despite the specification cant use it well cuz of the ram dont know if updating the phone or what you sentence out help upgrade the ram also dont know but my hunch
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,no change after turning off the memfusion yes thank you access this site facebook account page one account facebook help me
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,the secret of the phone is to turn off memfusion off and the lag will be gone note never tu more no change after turning off the memfusion
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,it is quite nice ofcourse absolutely infinix smart hd is bad phone
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,which phone can you recommend me to buy im gamer rog strix

Infinix,Smart 7 HD,my opera mini is not working and my smart hd usually hot
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,the phones pretty decent overall but theres this annoying lag whenever pull the more yes mine do lag too
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,is because of the phones processors which phone can you recommend me to buy im gamer

Infinix,Smart 7 HD,rubbish phone slow the os is horrible and the phone is not nice to use but its cheap so expectations cant be that high as its cheap
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,well about the ram you could change it in the settings to add an additional gb virtual ram ma more virtual ram can make the phone even slower as it relies on emmc storage it can bottleneck and makes it uncomfortable to use boot time can be slower too
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,ufs storage make this phone faster than phones with more ram and faster cpu it also means more if you want ufs on budget device recommend you hot although its gb only
Infinix,Smart 7 HD,bought before one month there problem with its battery very slow charging bought mine last month it had no battery issue everything about the phone is so nice and enjoyable but dont like the ram but love the phone camera it so bright and used for gaming play pubg in it so nice for video and tik toking

Infinix,Smart 7,for those who dont know infinix smart uses mt helio chipset it has quadcore cortexa processor running at ghz with powervrge gpu it can run basic tasks but may struggle with multitasking or resource intensive apps you might think that this phone is good because it has gb ram but remember more ram doesnt mean more power if your processor is the bottleneck
Infinix,Smart 7,euros for this
Infinix,Smart 7,when bought this thought it was good phone not until saw the chipset and the processor and months of using it it became more laggy and it crashes lot when played roblox it was so laggy cant even play that much

Infinix,Smart 7,honestly despise this phone the overheating is something else secondly the phone is so slow more the overheating is so bad

Infinix,Smart 7,its amazing phone battery is perfect good network
Infinix,Smart 7,its good so far bought my phone since august and the only problem is it cant run heavy games like call of duty and genshin impact well its cheap phone to begin with didnt expect high but overall its okay for nd phone love it
Infinix,Smart 7,theres persistent lag that follows you everywhere cant process videos properly more mine working pretty good the only problem is cant play heavy games like call of duty mobile but its not surprising its cheap phone dont expect too much from it the good side is you can use this as your nd phone if have better one

Infinix,Smart 7,yes thank you for stating that but infinix smart is better than pop but dont like pop more think both are equal none is better than the other look at the camera setup the position of the fingerprint the same storage capacity the same size the difference between pop and smart is the name infinix smart tecno pop do you know that the case cover phone pouch of smart can fit in exactly as pop and vice versa battery lasts the same way in both phones same mp camera in the case of pop pro same with spark pro and hot

Infinix,Smart 7,good this budget
Infinix,Smart 7,its already out yet and it uses normal android oh my god android with helio chipset even android struggled to run with that really hope it would still equip with unisoc
Infinix,Smart 7,is this out yet is it come with android go or regular android its already out yet and it uses normal android
Infinix,Smart 7,just bought smart plus it has very interesting features but its not fluid enough my more infinix smart plus has not been announced yet

Infinix,Smart 7,but why is some specifications of this phone not updated
Infinix,Smart 7,some specs still missing chipset cpu and gpu pls do something about it even the producers no add all this things for there flyers
Infinix,Smart 7,expect tiger is gonna be in this better than the sca
Infinix,Smart 7,hope something better than unisoc sca expect tiger is gonna be in this
Infinix,Smart 7,wen is this phone to be launch am using the phone but the phone is running high temperature too much
Infinix,Smart 7,the chipset on this is most likely helio with powervr ge gpu although official infinix website says nothing about it
Infinix,Smart 7,this is like pop pro know infinix phones to have square shaped fingerprint scanner only this has circular fingerprint
Infinix,Smart 7,hoping for an old helio or unisoc it would be an huge steal
Infinix,Smart 7,the phone should be mah and gb rom
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,no id say these phones dont get updates and are made for lasting for short time they more exactly even their new phones doesnt get clear updates plan
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,what is better choice buying an entry level android phone with and use it for more would say buy dollars phone for to years of use or you could buy an ex flagship for or so
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,smart how much last for phone
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,would imagine id want new phone after or so years no id say these phones dont get updates and are made for lasting for short time they slow down over time really
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,okay thanks getting an old flagship and custom romming it would be better
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,midranger will receive more updates and will be better choice in terms of usability and fe more okay thanks
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,nah the nokia plus is generally more than this infinix phone is like might be region dependent because its available for roughly for the variant here and some other latin american countries
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,theres the nokia plus with ufs more ram wireless fm radio rather useless ip rat more nah the nokia plus is generally more than this infinix phone is like
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,its also over times the price of this so they still have valid point you are right thoug more not really when the nokia plus with similar specs retails at slightly lesser price in most regions
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,its an phone the fact that it has ufs is already pretty good theres the nokia plus with ufs more ram wireless fm radio rather useless ip rating and stock android at the same price but it doesnt have punch hole notch
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,there is absolutely no difference between the smart and the smart hd honestly dont know why not infinix will do something like this am not surprised as this is not the first time and it definitely wont be the last time
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,it has one bad camera one potato disguised as camera and flash its an phone the fact that it has ufs is already pretty good
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,they are cheap for reason those components that you mention are available in different gra more thanks for the explanation these phones have ads and preinstalled bloatware im wondering since the gt pro doesnt have any pre installed bloatware then how can the phone priced below its segment are there any different approach for them to reduce the pricing or they gain very little profit from the product
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,and the iphone is superior in every way its also over times the price of this so they still have valid point you are right though it is better device think this device just proves how pointless the devices nokia make are
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,getting hz display large mah battery and ufs storage at this price is very decent more they are cheap for reason those components that you mention are available in different grades lower grades sometimes rejects from higher grade qc are sold for cheap and oems like infinix get those also these phones have ads and preinstalled bloatware just like windows pcs the oem get some subsidy from those companies pushing the ads and bloatware thats also another way they can price this very cheap
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,lmao this phone has hz display but iphone has hz display and the iphone is superior in every way
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,thought it was an iphone rumor mill render lmfaooo
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,please at least think before you post before insulting urself in public and before ur more lol what you better take an eye test so that you can actually see who is embarrassing himself here
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,buy this stick an apple sticker on the back install an iosesque launcher and gaslight people into thinking its pro max
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,only charging speed for mah battery
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,what its about eur lol its not even budget phone this is as entry level more youre even getting fullfat android here you cant say that about any other phone at this ultrabudget price point
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,decent price gb ram and the unisoc soc are kind of bad but as long as it handles basic tasks its good
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,good price with good specs did not like things and ram but that is ok as both depends on users choice
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,the way it looks is
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,good specs trash design
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,nice design before looking specs thought its upper midrange device
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,fhd should be present here what its about eur lol its not even budget phone this is as entry level as it gets
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,meh cant expect much from an average device infinix is now the king of same sp more what do you want at such low price
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,this is hilarious as it only euros and it must buy for most people for their secondary phone man
Infinix,Smart 8 HD,what an design wonder where they took it from

Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,regret having this phone crashes and cant even handle high resolution video quality not even absolute garbage not even roblox it can run even minecraft or its ripoff craftsman it couldnt handle the only good thing about this phone is just the audio quality dont buy this phone dont recommend it overall
Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,absolutely trash dont buy it swear this is really trash regret buying this trash
Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,guess it is alright although there is alot of downsides the phone cant handle some games and itll crash despite having gb of storage and gb of ram this phone cant even handle some high resolution videos like and above it is not even compatible to some things like live wallpaper themes mod apks that is compatible for android games like genshin impact honkai star rail cookie run kingdom etc and if you try to apk those games too bad it still is not compatible for this phone it feels like this is downgrade to android my android that only has gb of storage and gb of ram can run game smoothly but this phone cant for me this phone is the camera is great it can screen record and it is amazing why it can record the game sound but not your surroundings like people talking fan and any other noises though it would be great if this phone is compatible to doing anything like android
Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,out of all budget phonethis is probably one of the worsti main this phone because uhh im poor and regret buying this id rather recommend other phone than thislike samsung or tecno spark go and even itel with better chipset at almost the same price in indonesia and this phone feels like an ewaste it iseven my dad samsung run roblox and other game faster not recommended for this price
Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,the phone doesnt get the right connectionhad this phone for dont know how longit was bad when first got itit feels like it had gotten worse with its connection transmit link mbsreceived link megabytes per secondbut its actually receiving less then thatfrom kilo bytes persecond to bytes per secondbought from malaysia

Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,ur dad isnt selfish even my dad didnt buy for me maybe he was facing financial dif more if youre old enough to get job then work and save enough money to buy it if youre not old enough to work then do something to to have it as reward for hardwork like good academic grades helping around the houae
Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,can we record whatsapp calls on this phone

Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,my father do not buy me any phone he is selfish ur dad isnt selfish even my dad didnt buy for me maybe he was facing financial difficulties then
Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,keep in mind that this is budget phoneby budget means the specs are intermediate and you cannot expect performance like flagship yathis might not be your thing so go buy flagship model instead and prepare to spend more if you want high specsim using smart pro right now and all can say is it performs greatsuits my daily use of taking photosdoing designs for my work and all and im quite impressedjust dont go around comparing it with other high end models and youll be fineif youre looking for gaming phone go buy gaming phone thenbut if you want reliable sturdy and cost effective then this ones by far is the best choicetake it from not very tech savvy guy but do rely heavily on mobile phone for work purposesand im very satisfied with infinix smart proget the job done

Infinix,Smart 8 Pro,infinix just released this phone in brazil with gb ram gb internal storage configuration just bizarre considering how useless helio is

Infinix,Smart 8,this is mobile
Infinix,Smart 8,just my suggestion why not include antutu benchmark in spec
Infinix,Smart 8,this phone using ufs not emmc class
Infinix,Smart 8,infinixs average or rather rubbish camera is becoming too annoying
Infinix,Smart 8,please wanna ask is this phone good yes smooth
Infinix,Smart 8,infinix already have flagship its their zero series those arent really proper flagships mean flagship to compete with the best on the market
Infinix,Smart 8,wonder when are we going to see proper flagship from infinixor if we are ever going to more infinix already have flagship its their zero series
Infinix,Smart 8,yes its called magic ring how original
Infinix,Smart 8,same specs as the hot but has slower watt charging compared to the hot wit more keep in mind that not all region sell variant for the mostly use helio which is basically with hz support which also does not make any difference either
Infinix,Smart 8,wow phone launched in with only ghz ouch thats slow dont underestimate the performance of they are faster than lagfest helio whats the big deal of higher clock speed if without any performance cores unless if you compare between sca and understand
Infinix,Smart 8,ghz its not mean bad better than helio has clock speed ghz it all comes down to cpu architecture though the has cores while the has cores as we all know tha ax cores mostly focus on performance while the ones on power efficiency in that sense the running at ghz still have more potential than the running at ghz let the benchmarks from geekbench tell you that
Infinix,Smart 8,saw version of this phone but the specs here shows it has and also no gb unless you use the virtual ram
Infinix,Smart 8,is this full android or android go specs says no mention of go full android android go only happens to device lower than gb ram
Infinix,Smart 8,is nice product and need it
Infinix,Smart 8,mehrdadgha nov weight is missing what is the weight of infinix smart
Infinix,Smart 8,weight is missing
Infinix,Smart 8,cptpower nov since when low budget comes ith gb ram even samsung eur phones dont have more than gb ram correct information is gb ram gb rom
Infinix,Smart 8,midrange this is as lowbudget as it gets since when low budget comes ith gb ram even samsung eur phones dont have more than gb ram
Infinix,Smart 8,here in philippines that only cost usd from unbox diaries hahahaha thats steal when you think about it for this
Infinix,Smart 8,everybodys falling asleep hear crickets nothing interesting here just another more what would you expect samsung and iphones latest phones specs huh for this price point its already good for normal usage and not heavy gaming for this price you can get punch hole cam
Infinix,Smart 8,it didnt mention anything in usb section during that time though many youtubers reviewd this phone and it has usb
Infinix,Smart 8,finally no more helio
Infinix,Smart 8,poco and redmi better high specific cheapest price than this weak all
Infinix,Smart 8,it does it didnt mention anything in usb section during that time though
Infinix,Smart 8,expect this to have usb it does
Infinix,Smart 8,its essentially tecno pop just different looking flash transsion has knack for incorporating the same designs in their brands xiaomi has also done the same with redmi and poco
Infinix,Smart 8,waste
Infinix,Smart 8,so its pop with complete android instead of go edition but without stereo speakers interesting choices bit do like that theyve basically inverted the flash of the pop to make it ring flash which is lot more useful and is actually huge feature on the zero
Infinix,Smart 8,at least its much better than jio feature phone sry dont know those phones
Infinix,Smart 8,somthing for the mm jack and sd card people at least its much better than jio feature phone
Infinix,Smart 8,most newest ultra budget chinese phone is getting iphone camera layout design and dynamic island feature too
Infinix,Smart 8,currently use unisoc as backup phoneand tell you its the worst processor curre more at least is more usable than which phone are you using as backup
Infinix,Smart 8,ordinary midrange phone this is what we can consider lower low entry phone
Infinix,Smart 9 HD,is the screen ips is the storage ufs whats the soc
Infinix,Smart 9 HD,mrv jul no phone can be worst than this omo you are very funny

Infinix,Smart 9 HD,anything from your kind is always useless sentence like this why dont you create you more its really not that deep bro also the reason it looks like bootleg iphone is because of the square camera module and infinix has copied the pro iphone designs in the past
Infinix,Smart 9 HD,bootleg iphone anything from your kind is always useless sentence like this why dont you create your own phone and put the rear cameras on each corner of the phone you to avoid copy bet you cant create one you old hag
Infinix,Smart 9 HD,another garbage in the house wrong may correct you its egarbage also known as etrash or ewaste ready for the edump or rather elandfill

Infinix,Smart 9,smart is the best what smart colour is your own
Infinix,Smart 9,its so bad the battery is easy to be drained and it keeps turning off whenever open facebook and when play games it goes off when you receive some apps all of them are said to be incompatible thats why all my apps are download if this to be rated im rating it

Infinix,Smart 9,this device keeps being the same after each modellagging and slowsometimes do not respond to more then what your buying is fake
Infinix,Smart 9,both the and smart priced the exact same but for me you should go with because it has better cpu better cameras full version of android faster charging better battery more os updates till android dont even know if infinix will be even supported the only good thing with infinix is the display design and hz and the stereo speakers
Infinix,Smart 9,im using smart and im looking forward to grab the new smart advice you alwa more my friend dooont
Infinix,Smart 9,so whats the differ between android and android go android go is optimized for lower specs hardware thats why you cant install some apps or games that requires more processing power to run
Infinix,Smart 9,sensitive for other apps you cannot download what you want
Infinix,Smart 9,its lighter version of android whats removed from it can it run normal apps fb maps etc
Infinix,Smart 9,guys can android go download the normal facebook normal google maps and youtube pleas more its really good for gaming infinix smart is very good
Infinix,Smart 9,yep you can install it so whats the differ between android and android go
Infinix,Smart 9,cant on front light during video call in the night why
Infinix,Smart 9,please why am unable to on front light during video call in the night
Infinix,Smart 9,lmao who are they fooling hz on helio tested phones with helio more you smart as its cheap phone its not meant for gaming the hz is for watching videos and for the ui
Infinix,Smart 9,unfortunately android go is bad its not bad at all stop talking complete rubbish android go is limited yes but it is supposed to be doesnt mean its bad
Infinix,Smart 9,do love smart but what people ar complaining think wil go for hot pro
Infinix,Smart 9,after full review of this phone the main problem of the phone is that it runs on android go ed more recently have just bought this phone in december and honestly the experience isnt that bad but one thing do hate about the phone is the fact that you cant even download certain games recently tried to install minecraft but it said device not compatible had known what go edition was would have just switched to an oppo or vivo
Infinix,Smart 9,bring back the selection of refresh rate between auto change hz hz and hz we bought more yes its true first when bought smart january have selection and after update has no longer hz refresh rate
Infinix,Smart 9,alwayson display for an lcd this must be first
Infinix,Smart 9,absolutely some folks want their budget phones to rival highend mobile devices lmao oh so you are one of those xiaomi glazers right
Infinix,Smart 9,mine refuse to install aetherxs is they way can make it install
Infinix,Smart 9,pop is better with charging instead of smart of
Infinix,Smart 9,the spec here says helio but its showing helio on the phone the one that uses the helio chipset is the infinix smart without the words hd try checking your cellphone is there hd written on it you can check on your cellphone box if there is hd written on it then you are using an hd infinix smart
Infinix,Smart 9,sometimes some video are played with bad resolution even if it was on resolutiondo you guys felt this
Infinix,Smart 9,so if you guys wondering why it is always restrict to download app that you want to use that is because it use android go and android go have limited app access to it soo mostly not every app you can download and it also need to compare with your gpu because the gpu need to equal if your phone can handle the game graphic or not
Infinix,Smart 9,as much as like having decent phone that could run casual game ie mlbb what hate about the most is how despite having specs that could benefit it restricts me from downloading almost half if not my whole list of games that want to play dont get me wrong am impressed on how smooth it is when playing offline games or certain emulators but feel like the presence of android go would leave me both frustrated and saddened just wanted to play blue archive or even armor attack but android go decided to say nuh uh and outright restricts them by saying not compatible to your device tried taptap to bypass this problem but once again the problem still remains im still using this phone for normal usage and of course little bit of gaming and im currently thinking about my next upgrade and maybe this time would remind my parents to take good look at its os just in case and also more ram and memory
Infinix,Smart 9,the infinix smart released in october has been disappointing experience for me due to significant limitations in its software the android go edition paired with xos falls short in several critical areas ultimately impacting user satisfaction and functionality one of the most frustrating aspects of this phone is the issue with thirdparty apps the device often prevents the installation of certain apps citing compatibility issues even when those apps work perfectly fine on other devices this limitation severely restricts the phones usability and hinders customization which is major part of the android experience additionally the go version of android has proven to be highly restrictive key features like splitscreen multitasking are removed limiting the devices versatility for someone who relies on multitasking this omission is significant drawback on top of that the phone struggles to handle even basic gaming games frequently close due to insufficient ram making the experience frustrating and unreliable had been aware of these issues would not have invested in the infinix smart this experience has been so disappointing that will never purchase another phone running android or the go version again the limitations imposed by these versions have turned potentially decent phone into source of frustration and strongly advise others to consider these shortcomings before making similar investment
Infinix,Smart 9,not too good phone for the name poor camera mp poor android version nonsense
Infinix,Smart 9,was like how comes lcd display with always on display of course yes and it works
Infinix,Smart 9,it used android go is because it only has gb of builtin ram but theres gb ram version of the phone
Infinix,Smart 9,the pain is it doesnt have an ful android specifications and it lags sometimes cant download some apps even when it has very big memory cant installs sent in xender unless download in play store dont understand this
Infinix,Smart 9,brand new but lag is on normal use lmao dont buy any infinix
Infinix,Smart 9,why would smart not be able to play football dont understand why it cant play efootball
Infinix,Smart 9,just why dont think about ram gb more think little bit lags playing roblox game if play other offline game still fast working
Infinix,Smart 9,this smart is terrible it lags the apps and even the ui system keep crashing you need to use the extended ram sht just to make the phone run smoothly my friends spark go is even better its smooth to use even with the extended ram turned off
Infinix,Smart 9,hz on is crazy version doesnt have it and only have hz
Infinix,Smart 9,piece of junk brick it keeping lagging for no reason cant do anything just keep lagging just want to adjust the volume then the phone lag and freeze please avoid this photo at all cost go for tecno
Infinix,Smart 9,mediatek helio is
Infinix,Smart 9,dont think this phone have infrared port yeah this phone dont have infrared
Infinix,Smart 9,go for spark if infrared is important to
Infinix,Smart 9,lets hope the infinix smart is actually smart like at least gigs of ram full andro more why is the successor of and the can go up to hz while goes up to hz only
Infinix,Smart 9,not it should be at least or if its helio gg it will cost more and it gonna be mid range device
Infinix,Smart 9,it gets out of due to very little ram although no lags found my variant is version more you can build custom rom or custom kernel by yourself for everyone else or you could go find good samaritan on the internet to build it for you
Infinix,Smart 9,kindly add nfc capabilities wed appreciate maybe your variant does not have but this device has nfc along with otg support
Infinix,Smart 9,its ram and is to poor
Infinix,Smart 9,why smart they dont have messenger floating and will not working picture in picture more true they must get rid of the android go
Infinix,Smart 9,garbage phone nothing is functioning on it
Infinix,Smart 9,how to lock app on smart as far as know this phone doesnt have native app lock feature you have to install app lock app from play store
Infinix,Smart 9,believe smart is great value for money
Infinix,Smart 9,always on display in ips lcd infinix is fishing in troubled waters
Infinix,Smart 9,another very low ram it has additional ram
Infinix,Smart 9,alwaysondisplay on lcd is absolute diabolical
Infinix,Smart 9,this product has been available in my country for few days now
Infinix,Smart 9,agree you would be smart enough to not buy piece of junk lcd gonly pla more no it is named smart cause thats the generation of infinix
Infinix,Smart 9,the infinix smart series have never been smart never agree you would be smart enough to not buy piece of junk lcd gonly plastic brick with charging for mah battery by transsion

Infinix,Zero 20,infinix zero very good my father has the infinix zero and its good phone for gaming
Infinix,Zero 20,this cell phone is oxm im user of this cell and satisfied
Infinix,Zero 20,wow this phone almost like ghost noone ever talk about this zero or even selling again in market place and is this the only infinix phone with metal frame if it is am lucky to have this phone very durable
Infinix,Zero 20,price of iphone pros probably will get this phone days later all want is more me toouser inhand review needed
Infinix,Zero 20,how so compare this phone with infiinix note
Infinix,Zero 20,is ultrawide lens has night mode
Infinix,Zero 20,thats strange means and by making this shouldve succeeded it yeah but it didnt this phone is for completely different needs look at the selfie camera is that downgrade as well dont think so its the best selfie cam on any phone because this is for people who take more selfies than pictures with the rear camera
Infinix,Zero 20,its not successor to it and its significantly cheaper zero series never got more thats strange means and by making this shouldve succeeded it
Infinix,Zero 20,zero as by the naming its not successor to it and its significantly cheaper zero series never got successor
Infinix,Zero 20,downgrades compared to which phone exactly zero as by the naming
Infinix,Zero 20,what huge downgrade in the cameras downgrades compared to which phone exactly
Infinix,Zero 20,am in love with this phone its still budget friendly phone but with some very high end specs that make it still get that more premium feel and stand out from some few budget phone available out there
Infinix,Zero 20,update to latest build found no hanging issues on my end sir carried aggregation available or not
Infinix,Zero 20,problems with sound output if used for live streaming using soundcard the sound sounds like tin and like its compressed waiting for system update but if not fixed then have to throw it away
Infinix,Zero 20,need advice to take infinix zero or not is this good phone yes it is
Infinix,Zero 20,not up to the mark as per camera is concerned hanging issues is found in mobile recomm more update to latest build found no hanging issues on my end
Infinix,Zero 20,wish that this phone is the complete set with minor specs upgrade combined from infinix note and tecno pova pro what else on the regular infinix note is being released im quite exited to arrive in the ph as well hope it is an affordable
Infinix,Zero 20,need advicefor photography infinix zero redmi note pro or infinix zero pro zero pro debes
Infinix,Zero 20,vivo or zero
Infinix,Zero 20,know the better option is to look for older phone then new phones like this weak phone more wow thats an amazing price for that phone well done
Infinix,Zero 20,good but lacking no its pretty amazing for the price
Infinix,Zero 20,if want compare pls compare with the same price ofcourse more expensive more better
Infinix,Zero 20,bros braindead for compaireing phone to phone which costs more the processor is also major thing to consider on determining why smartphone cancant record resolution besides youre comparing flagship smartphone to midrange one dude better fis your comparison lol
Infinix,Zero 20,samsung galaxy vs infinix zero samsung galaxy is better than zero in these more bro you are comparing inr phone with phone
Infinix,Zero 20,pkr only for hm lens are you kidding me yearold realme pro has far more superior results sitting around mp the price tags of budget and mid price phones are too harsh
Infinix,Zero 20,but it has sd card slot headphone jack dual sim and charger know the better option is to look for older phone then new phones like this weak phone mean saw motorola edge plus model for but no sd card slot but overall awesome phone
Infinix,Zero 20,nice and waiting for this new update infinix zero
Infinix,Zero 20,by the way zero also have dedicated sd card slot you need to notice properly well you real more and zero have mm jack omg
Infinix,Zero 20,am able use internet through ethernet cable adapter on infinix zero phone
Infinix,Zero 20,megapixels but no iphone pro having only megapixels and can record at bros braindead for compaireing phone to phone which costs more
Infinix,Zero 20,all microsdxc slots should support all microsdxc cards the sd association isnt messing more ik its even more dumber question but is it possible sd card reader will also read any space as long as its genuine
Infinix,Zero 20,how much sd card can it support upto all microsdxc slots should support all microsdxc cards the sd association isnt messing around when it claims that its microsdxc standard supports up to tb cards dont worry about other lower figures that may appear on certain spec sheets this silly practice began when microsdxc was first rolled out and gb cards were the largest available the early adopters of microsdxc opted to have disclaimers such as up to gb this disclaimer was adjusted accordingly on newer devices as bigger cards became available youll notice that gsmarena only puts microsdxc on spec sheets probably because they noticed that the disclaimer figures were misguided and at odds with the microsdxc standard you can rest assured that any modern device rocking microsdxc slot will accept genuine tb microsdxc cards as well as genuine tb cards when they get released if you encounter problems with microsdxc slot you either have fakefaulty card or faulty slot
Infinix,Zero 20,sir infinix zero slow mo available yes front and real camera both have slow motion
Infinix,Zero 20,nothing so far about os updates but im honestly not freaking out about that at the mome more sir infinix zero slow mo available
Infinix,Zero 20,dont mix between actual ram and ram plus there is not match in readingacess speed between act more yeah
Infinix,Zero 20,it is their approximation of sd card size that the device is going to read and is rec more have noticed another problem its the phone box some reviews have the sticker saying gb ram and some saying gb ram wona know if its just the sticker or the actual phone that wont have the extend ram
Infinix,Zero 20,but when msg infinix they say its tb like whats going on who am supposed to trust it is their approximation of sd card size that the device is going to read and is recommended you can either trust them or not
Infinix,Zero 20,if you saw gb max external on infinix website dont buy larger sd card than it would more but when msg infinix they say its tb like whats going on who am supposed to trust
Infinix,Zero 20,on the infinix web it says gb external but when contacted infinix they say tb you say more if you saw gb max external on infinix website dont buy larger sd card than it would cause read write issues gb is recommended tb cards might be hit or miss
Infinix,Zero 20,ppi still looks sharp if you see phones with ppi range its terrible on the infinix web it says gb external but when contacted infinix they say tb you say tb bruh am confused
Infinix,Zero 20,hamisu mk oct infinix manufacturers should increase the quality of the screen resolution and the ppi density more ppi still looks sharp if you see phones with ppi range its terrible
Infinix,Zero 20,am absolutely depressed cuz on the website it says external look httpswww more the one you mentioned is the note not zero external support up to terabyte
Infinix,Zero 20,terabyte am absolutely depressed cuz on the website it says external look httpswwwinfinixmobilitycomsmartphonenotespecs
Infinix,Zero 20,infinix manufacturers should increase the quality of the screen resolution and the ppi density of these two new products of zero series to atleast like and the ppi should atleast be like and advised you guys to reduce the size of the phone to inch that or for zero ulta was too big for me the screen resolution and the ppi density is very important thank
Infinix,Zero 20,have you updated the os too nothing so far about os updates but im honestly not freaking out about that at the moment android isnt that old and dont know if zero pro will keep its stability with an os update securitygoogle updates are also ok so far and comes regularly even with bit of delay
Infinix,Zero 20,nothing like external ram dont understand what you mean btw yes it does have extended ram
Infinix,Zero 20,just clear one more doubt for me people please this does have the extended ram support right nothing like external ram
Infinix,Zero 20,ig ill buy this one over note pro just the mah is meh but that hz tho more no comment delete option so ill just reply it does not have fps hz still good tho
Infinix,Zero 20,oh why no for this brand wonder toond the price is high
Infinix,Zero 20,very disappointed that at fps is not available shame shame video on smartphone is useless not much different quality than fhd video it need much storage
Infinix,Zero 20,oh come on at least have dimensity or above and again helio is still the best wha more but it has sd card slot headphone jack dual sim and charger
Infinix,Zero 20,mp ultrawide or telephoto some sources confirms that its ultrawde but no official word so far
Infinix,Zero 20,dear sweet infinix we need punch hole selfie camera better software best pr more no
Infinix,Zero 20,always hate those who make these comments but this time it is valid this is joke eve more think its just wrongmissing info for example infinix zero pro my current phone can record videos at pfps with both main and selfie camera and its xos version was updated to version but this info wasnt here in gsm arena just send the guys more detailed info and they updated everything it might be same with zero and what we see here is probably preliminary info since the phone is on presale think we should wait until someone gets one for review
Infinix,Zero 20,samsung series great but tooo expensive samsung series good but high price and samsu more in that case nothing fits your criteria
Infinix,Zero 20,sure why not ill use your previous comment as base to recomend most of midrange sam more samsung series great but tooo expensive samsung series good but high price and samsung series hope you understand
Infinix,Zero 20,mp camera but you cant record video it must be joke chipset limitation most likely
Infinix,Zero 20,just juggling partscreating same phones with different names
Infinix,Zero 20,oooh good thank you dear for you information can other brand come in this pri more sure why not ill use your previous comment as base to recomend most of midrange samsung phones for an example they have exactly what you pointed as important in all aspects
Infinix,Zero 20,now its time to stick with
Infinix,Zero 20,its easier if you pick another brand mate oooh good thank you dear for you information can other brand come in this price range
Infinix,Zero 20,there is an infinix zero ultra rumored so think that will be the flagship from this company coooooooooooooool
Infinix,Zero 20,the zero ultra is the flagship not the zero and even then the ultra is more closer to more btw zero ultra officially leaked all specs in one of infinix official aliexpress stores
Infinix,Zero 20,shouldnt this be flagship from this company and no thats joke and the pric more the zero ultra is the flagship not the zero and even then the ultra is more closer to midranger than flagship with the chip inside was shown in the teaser video and some of the other specs
Infinix,Zero 20,feel it will be midranger with dimensity in disguise of flagship but anyway it will be midranger we already know the base specs but it will be the flagship from this company
Infinix,Zero 20,absolutely love it
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,is xos android available on this in pakistan no not yet

Infinix,Zero 30 4G,unless if you bought the version of zero they do have outstanding camera quality compar more zero camera is better than rmn pro
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,would say that redmi note pro is better in terms of camera features have used rm pro zero much more better camera than rmn pro both photography and videos
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,well am using this since month its better than others in battery but camera so so pe more camera so so phone shows better performance than iphone when it comes to photography videos are just average
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,zero best cell for its price range agree
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,redmi note vs infinix zero asking coz ppl say infinix always shows alot of ads an more there is no add on zero
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,iphone plus is always better option if we are talking about performance and durability more there is no bugs on zero just uptade applications and works percent fine and smooth
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,anyone please guide me this phone buy or not or other phone buy recomeneded

Infinix,Zero 30 4G,my infinix zero have many issues but the top most are apps crashing problems and top most is its proximity sensor problem another issues is when we listen an audio message from whatsapp it automatically switch between main speaker to ear speaker and ear speaker to main speaker its kind of embarrassment when you are listening your family audio and it automatically switch the speaker not recommended phone waste of money untill infinix resolve this issue

Infinix,Zero 30 4G,moto or zero
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,same issue on netflix lagging
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,why netflix lag on infinix zero any solution
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,buy redmi because zero specification is not good as compare to redmi so would sugge more is slightly better than the sd gen the redmi just has flat display instead of curved and does not have ois or eis on its video recording features the infinix has eis at fps on the back and on the front camera yeah the redmi has ultrawide but the quality on it is far from its main camera so it is just like filler camera
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,this seems like good value for the price just wanted to know whats the difference bet more infinix zero and zero is offer you quality camera this phone doesnt focus on gaming well the difference between this two version is only the camera and charging watts they have the same mega pixel int both main and front camera version can only shoot up to kfps video main and front while can shoot up to kfps video and also have ultrawide camera as well as ois features which is reduced the camera shakes

Infinix,Zero 30 4G,zero cameras are good netflix lagging problem or sometime ear speakers sensor problem when listen ur whatsapp voice msg
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,antutu mobile phone infinix zero is
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,hello all purchased the phone one week review good network reception almost every where more how was the video experience is it good for multimedia viewing
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,is infinix zero anoled daplay good for multimedia and for videos watching
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,is ambled display of infinix zero good
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,very bad service infinix you are not satisfied from this device how you find the device
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,no dedicated memory card slot no buy having sd card it might be slightly price increase
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,the cons of this phone is not expandable and there is no mm headphone jack
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,what other options are available around this price range similar or better specs if flat more you could go for poco you can find same price range for better performance flat display
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,its not about the chipset you guys the curve is also has fashion sense its like seeing dime with astonishing value but when you flip it over suddenly you faintly felt muddy look on you face as you intrusive thought swayed looking back maybe those gsm yapper werent wrong the end happy october
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,true for snapdragon the last thing midg is and the price is higher than indeed also infinix uses mostly mediatek which basically puts any qualcomm chipset out of question
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,if youre tired of provide more modern solution for gonly phones please hel more true for snapdragon the last thing midg is and the price is higher than
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,they are just abusing gpls give it rest if youre tired of provide more modern solution for gonly phones please helio is currenly the most reliable gonly chipset qualcomm dont care about gonly chipsets anymore so mediatek reigns alone in this segment they still us sd and dont see qualcomm lovers whinning anyway if miracle happens and these brands decides to do ultimate gonly chipset with considerable improvement over helio then you will see it vanish but meanwhile will be everywhere deal with it
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,well if it isnt itel lmao xd it isnt but this display size is generic and they both came from transsion
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,the finish of the white one reminds me of the finish on the huawei pro most newest chinese smartphone design came from huawei and also skin os came from ios
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,meanwhile the note pro wins its got mm jack and sd slot some other countries wont get note pro
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,lmfao because of that it wins yes the zero and note pro is no difference except the design curved screen and lastly no headphone jack and sd card wouldnt enjoy without them even have bluetooth earbuds still prefer wired because dont feel like gaming with crappy bluetooth latency and sd cards are useful for storing music usually listen to music when dont have any access to internet dont get me started with online music services that requires you to pay in order to download music
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,zero for the main and selfie camera note pro for the charging features other than more personal ly prefer the symmetrical bezels on all sides and also the fast charging but it sad thing it doesnt have mm jack but rarely listen using head phones for quite some time al ready but it still nice to have it
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,just get the version those are better
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,note pro or zero zero for the main and selfie camera note pro for the charging features other than that if you like curved displays then get this if not then get the note pro
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,can anyone here kindly pls tell me which is better so is it the redmi note pro or infinix more would say that redmi note pro is better in terms of camera features
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,they really couldve put an ultrawide here even mp would be better than mp depth
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,thats quite the interesting design the whole specs leaked yesterday and sent tip to gsm arena unfortunately zero looks more like downgrade from zero in camera department no ois and smaller selfie camera no ultrawide
Infinix,Zero 30 4G,why dont they just ditch and go for mtk instead because obvious reasons its chipset for phone unless mediatek unisoc or qualcomm do some kind of ultimate flagship level chipset helio will be everywhere
Infinix,Zero 30,friends after the update the battery is draining very fast sar value is too high it causes more headache what are you on about ive got no such issues with mine
Infinix,Zero 30,isnt that common sense likeeee do you want it to stay at the same battey percent for hours more friends after the update the battery is draining very fast sar value is too high it causes headache battery drains quickly solution set screen refresh rate to make update downgrades the phone is excellent but it gives you huge headache it may be the best phone in the world for its price but it gives you huge headache
Infinix,Zero 30,hello my old phone realme cy was less laggier and my infinix zero is somehow laggy like more set your refresh rate to hz instead of automatic if that doesnt help check for software update otherwise your device must be faulty id say
Infinix,Zero 30,probably wont add mine since it wipes your data but where did you get the custom rom its long story
Infinix,Zero 30,gifted my dad that added custom rom of xos probably wont add mine since it wipes your data but where did you get the custom rom
Infinix,Zero 30,you should check for updates it got android xos like months ago as for android th more as for android the phone is more than capable of course it is but mine will definitely never get it you should check for updates it got android xos like months ago know it did my mom also has zero thats an india model and has android however mine is model meant for the european market so dont think it will ever see an update but check it almost every day
Infinix,Zero 30,nope mine is still on android likely never seeing android either because this model more you should check for updates it got android xos like months ago as for android the phone is more than capable though wouldnt count on it being guaranteed since the zero released at time before infinixs direct statement of years of major updates did see facebook comment on infinixs statement with the question but infinix only replied with what sounded like please wait so its not certain whether itll get android but also not impossible ive heard some rumors that itll come somewhere around august since older phones usually get slower updates and some tech reviewers stated that theyve asked infinix as well with them saying up to years though not specified whether its major or just security patches personally think xos looks miles better than prior xos versions so really do hope the rumors are true
Infinix,Zero 30,wanna ask something any of you guys already get android xos nope mine is still on android likely never seeing android either because this model was meant to be sold in europe where they didnt sell many of it
Infinix,Zero 30,am in uganda and want to get this phone how do get it delivered to me
Infinix,Zero 30,switched to this phone from the redmi note and its processor is really good for its price what did notice was high battery usage which is not usual for mah battery
Infinix,Zero 30,hello do all of your suggested methods but it still becomes laggy but it occurs only whenev more if someone ask why does it change hz hz maybe you turn on the battery saver or you got too many background apps
Infinix,Zero 30,check your settings maybe the update put your refresh rate setting to autoswitch refre more hello do all of your suggested methods but it still becomes laggy but it occurs only whenever video call or use picture in picture from hz to hz bought it from philippines also
Infinix,Zero 30,honestly no idea but infinix updates were terrible back then my zero pro stopped getti more thank you for your answer hope that somehow my global unit will also get the android update at some point anything newer than that dont really care about at least not on this phone
Infinix,Zero 30,hey so dont know if you remember it but had zero already an gb ram indi more honestly no idea but infinix updates were terrible back then my zero pro stopped getting updates in think just use it at home for daily tasks anyway wish could switch the battery and keep it working for some more years
Infinix,Zero 30,first thing to do is check which apps and settings are draining your battery also there more hey so dont know if you remember it but had zero already an gb ram india specific model gifted that to my mom so no longer have it but did buy another one out of curiosity and nostalgia factor this time its gb ram global version so was looking into the android update for this phone which it shouldve gotten about months ago but my global variant is still on android with the november security patch and it doesnt have an update its still an amazing phone tho but just wanted ask maybe you know why it doesnt have an update or how can get it to update
Infinix,Zero 30,ya already update it and yey it fixed fr what issue
Infinix,Zero 30,update your device the issue has been solved ya already update it and yey it fixed
Infinix,Zero 30,alert guys bought this phone last september this phone has been really really faboulous in more hi are you experiencing same issues until now april
Infinix,Zero 30,hi think its just the phone thermal throttling under battery to help preserve bat more update your device the issue has been solved
Infinix,Zero 30,will this get android remember waiting months for the android even if it released way before
Infinix,Zero 30,my phone hasnt gotten update yet it lag so much cant play single game with more im using poco pro for yrs still good until now quality for gaming and camera still best
Infinix,Zero 30,hi apparently already used this phone almost year and after got the update to android more hi think its just the phone thermal throttling under battery to help preserve battery life and reduce cpu clock speed to help the battery last longer its normal and it also happens to my iz as well but just charge my phone from to to preserve the battery of my phone hope this helps
Infinix,Zero 30,this phone when youre in data looses its signal whenever im playing mlbb not recommend more youre probably playing at ultra settings at hz the device heats up pretty quickly as result it shouldnt go over or youre draining its battery health as well prefer adjusting it ot hz then just play ml at medium to high settings if playing games like genshin then low to medium settings should be enough
Infinix,Zero 30,ngl everyonethis phone can handle all of my pp edit in after motioni can also use this for video filming and gaming aswell
Infinix,Zero 30,hi additionally used redmi note pro for while the gps feature of redmi note pro that came out years ago is times better than infinix zero redmi note pro showed my location and where was looking accurately centimeter by centimeter this phone supposedly has gps and compass the compass is faulty it always shows different place am walking on the road and it shows the opposite direction gps keeps losing meters here and there was even walking on roads didnt know with redmi note pro but fake sensors were used in this infinix zero that came out years later they literally ripped us off
Infinix,Zero 30,as of todays observation from update to my infinix zero is freezing for about more bro tell us an update about your zero if it fixed after next the updated
Infinix,Zero 30,my infinix zero mobile the security update process has been running for the past two days but it has not completed yet this prolonged update is causing significant inconvenience
Infinix,Zero 30,android is still running on my infinix zero when will it get the android country pakistan
Infinix,Zero 30,fr does this happen bruh im abt to buy this phone so tell me is it worth my money yes this is for real but now just got an update from android to android and they focus on making camera more stable havent try it yet if the same problem will appear or not hoping it already fix
Infinix,Zero 30,have my zero for at least year now and recently found some problem filming usin more fr does this happen bruh im abt to buy this phone so tell me is it worth my money
Infinix,Zero 30,nope it actually did as of the current date im replying to this reply right now in the philippines where am from my infinix zero has received formal android update and some few security patches and few optimization from prior to the release of the android update on my device but im not sure whether to update to just here to clarify and spread some awareness yeah
Infinix,Zero 30,you compare samsung over infinix nahh they are far behind well confidently say they not par if compare few years ago but now think samsung is really decline in term hardware quality that why compared to infinix phone since they seems improved recently
Infinix,Zero 30,wait notice and has different spec so this one is for yes
Infinix,Zero 30,without card slot there really should be gb option otherwise the device becomes simply unviable for lot of users wanted one by my current gb phone already has only gb left on the internal storage
Infinix,Zero 30,which better between infinix zero and samsung you compare samsung over infinix nahh they are far behind
Infinix,Zero 30,has this phone received updates for android or security up dates thanks nope
Infinix,Zero 30,its infinix zero better than xiaomi pro or not if you dont mind having subpar ultrawide and average selfie you should get pro
Infinix,Zero 30,still killer phone imo absolutely great cameras and performance beautiful looking display and fast charging value for money is
Infinix,Zero 30,read somewhere that it is said that the infinix zero can be able to connect to satellite call and messages but according to specifications here in gsmarena nothing like that whats going on
Infinix,Zero 30,both have decent cameras but would suggest note pro with software support mm audio more just stop advert another redmi or poco phones it is dead alone after years dont waste your time for advert about those phones it is just for one year use
Infinix,Zero 30,make sure to click the kfps to use the feature its at default think yes have the phone excellent cameras at both main and selfie
Infinix,Zero 30,infinix is gradually becoming beast this phone is top notch though wanted the gt pro but more they have new gt pro you can try that instead
Infinix,Zero 30,for its price amazing
Infinix,Zero 30,og may to stop ads from accessing your phone go to settings click on private dns and input this more id rather not have ads to begin with
Infinix,Zero 30,bugs and ads lmao to stop ads from accessing your phone go to settings click on private dns and input thisdnsadguardcom and save youll never see no ads anymore
Infinix,Zero 30,guys how about the amoled burn is it problem
Infinix,Zero 30,nice all rounder phone from infinix probably the best all rounder in this price range be more this phone is better in more important aspects than the redmi note pro like chipset and cameras while the redmi has brighter higher resolution display and faster charging plus the zero has hz instead of hz but thats not so important httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Infinix,Zero 30,android with bugs xiaomi as usual bugs and ads lmao
Infinix,Zero 30,but one thing holding me back from buying this phone is the fact that infinix promised only more android with bugs xiaomi as usual
Infinix,Zero 30,same issuesignals problem my understanding is it may not be the phone but your service providers tower is it far from you also will drop calls if its busy overloaded with calls busy time of the day check your settings try this link for help copy and paste on youtube httpsyoutubefdudyxhtqe
Infinix,Zero 30,well for one there is the screen timeout feature you should check what time that more it is not like that and it is not only limited to not going off while charging have found that whenever put it down the top side first then the screen light goes off and the phone locks but when just put it down without being conscious of the top side going down first it stays awake sorry for my english if am unable to explain it perfectly because english isnt my first language
Infinix,Zero 30,this or redmi note pro im more on the selfie cam so who is more natural and better qua more both have decent cameras but would suggest note pro with software support mm audio jack so imp features many companies skipping decent processor for normal gaming fps gameplay on pubg so overall suggest rn pro
Infinix,Zero 30,so yesterday after heavy day of usage ended my day with hours of sot on the infinix ze more why is my infinix zero battery drain so fast
Infinix,Zero 30,actually what meant is note vip instead of note pro still zero the answer yeah absolutely for almost the same reasons and with one exception if you value wireless charging speeds then go for the note vip otherwise the cameras are still much better on the zero and the chipset while isnt technically better it runs cooler however do own both zero and note pro so can tell you if cameras arent important for you the note pro and its helio do the job just fine but the zero seems to be getting more software updates
Infinix,Zero 30,zero if you dont mind the curved display and have the money for it it has much fa more actually what meant is note vip instead of note pro still zero the answer
Infinix,Zero 30,which infinix model is better buy value note pro or zero zero if you dont mind the curved display and have the money for it it has much faster soc with support and way better cameras
Infinix,Zero 30,february security patch just arrived
Infinix,Zero 30,no worries still worth it for to good for gaming and camera the gps is accurate also battery can still up until the end of the day
Infinix,Zero 30,well there is no real dimensity amazon advertise this phone as so it didnt more there is absolutely nothing wrong with phone thats made in china use phones like that as well including infinix ones as for knockoff phones you should never get one its one thing that it will never get software update its likely lying about what android version its using how much ram it has and just about everything it already lied about its soc which is one of the most important thing in phone so if its not the mediatek dimensity then what is it could be an mt as well in which case it wont even have but it will still say it does and there is also no way this phone has screen to body ratio or that it even looks anything like that picture oh and would you trust this phone with your passwords and banking data you shouldnt
Infinix,Zero 30,guys please dont ever purchase that sefwon phone its knockoff ver more well there is no real dimensity amazon advertise this phone as so it didnt matter at all for under php it may be knockoff but hey you cant really beat that price as long as it has the standard gb ram gb rom as advertised then it may be fine buy hey cmon except for samsung sony and few other wellknown nonchinese brands these other mainstreams brands are all made in china right httpswwwamazoncomgpproductbcnhkk
Infinix,Zero 30,you can try amazon as see resemblance of this phone under the brand sefwon more guys please dont ever purchase that sefwon phone its knockoff version of the real gt pro with awful fake specs it literally says the chipset of that phone is mediatek dimensity which would be chipset given its dimensity branding but it doesnt even exist this is scam in plain sight
Infinix,Zero 30,more indepth things noted from using this phone in summary this isnt vlogger or more is it available in usa
Infinix,Zero 30,how do enable nfc
Infinix,Zero 30,it was dual app
Infinix,Zero 30,cant say the selfie camera is though true but the sensor size is basically the same on both of them mp should be enough for everyone
Infinix,Zero 30,because that has significantly better cameras more storage and sligthtly better performance cant say the selfie camera is though
Infinix,Zero 30,but why do you think the premier will be better buy than the zero because that has significantly better cameras more storage and sligthtly better performance
Infinix,Zero 30,the tecno is technically slightly more powerful but the cameras are lot better on the infin more but why do you think the premier will be better buy than the zero
Infinix,Zero 30,awesome never thought the phone would get af on its ultrawide lens
Infinix,Zero 30,the spec is pretty good its the only model from this brand with connectivity affor more its not the only model note but the best specs with from infinix to date
Infinix,Zero 30,minus this phone heating issue even play basic game and battery drain fast hope infinix can more first thing to do is check which apps and settings are draining your battery also there are tons of apps that works in the background of any phone some of them drains both battery and mobile data if they are not system apps consider restricting their battery usage and disabling background data do it with the correct apps and you will notice revelant improvement in performance and heat management of the phone
Infinix,Zero 30,theres no problem to the performance but please can you fix the sounds because when plug th more common sense low ur volume
Infinix,Zero 30,battery drain lot just charge it
Infinix,Zero 30,my goal is to have this kind of phone with an expensivelooking flagship camera screen that has an aesthetic design and higher storage was wrong thinkin that have to forgive my sin for dissing samsung think samsung is superior same as price as these
Infinix,Zero 30,also dont assume that its connected to wifi common sense use it also use it and it stays on the same percentage through the night it doesnt get hot easily and it barely drains so either your device is faulty or you did something wrong towith it
Infinix,Zero 30,battery drains fast battery is at was sleeping for hours and it drops to isnt that common sense likeeee do you want it to stay at the same battey percent for hours with you not using it but with your wifi or any wifi connection on and background apps
Infinix,Zero 30,kills my eyes my galaxy has better screen sort them new samsung galaxy more when your cat plays around on your keyboard and autocorrect kicks in
Infinix,Zero 30,live here in country where everyone is crazy phones must be durable okay because in these economic conditions they must last at least years also even though am years old still cannot overcome my gaming addiction want to slow processor do not want to play games like pubg etc features that phone should have for me very good camera large storage space very durable and impact resistant water and dust proof the screen should not tire the eyes love samsungs screens things that shouldnt be breaks and deteriorates easily when hit this phone is like that watched its tests screen hurts eyes bad camera also the fingerprint sensor of this phone does not work fingerprint sensor very bad after entering the digit password it starts to recognize it hours later it is the same again which shows that all the components of this phone are made in china and are flimsy why did buy this phone tax rates are very high in my country while state administrators live very luxurious life they torture honest and middleincome people with taxes here we pay for phones and buy phone we pay phones for the state as tax bought this phone because it said it was easy to get imei
Infinix,Zero 30,phone is good performance wise but its camera is not satisfied did you expect it to beat the ultra the cameras are great just not flagship level
Infinix,Zero 30,its not good for gaming it heats up even in low setting the thermal is not good this will ruin your amoled display
Infinix,Zero 30,after oct patch updation the display colour changed how to restore normal colour thanks in more thats weird mine hasnt changed but first try to restart your phone if thats not enough go to display brightness then color style and change it to your liking
Infinix,Zero 30,the latest update brought the october security patch complete always on display that can act more after oct patch updation the display colour changed how to restore normal colour thanks in advance
Infinix,Zero 30,best infinix phone had so far better than the redmi series running on mtkdimensity sd and the best cost effective phone in the philippines in my opinion hz refresh rate dimensity gb ram pled display for only sub php what more can you ask for
Infinix,Zero 30,batter back up is not good very bad battery backup
Infinix,Zero 30,when you play video games does it really drains fast it depends on the game itself and the display like hz or hz
Infinix,Zero 30,well was testing battery drains and charging last days and for charging it seems like to more when you play video games does it really drains fast
Infinix,Zero 30,again disappointing in some aspects like usb type instead it should be or above more usb type instead it should be or above which phone at this price has typec or above yeah thats right none of them the second thing is android version which should be or at least upgradeable to the phone came out before android did and it will be upgradeable to android there should be metal frame mean aluminum frame agree because even the xiaomi redmi note pro has it but that phone has worse ultrawidemacro camera and worse chipset you cant have everything at this sort of price point
Infinix,Zero 30,well it depends mine last day easily with hours of screen on time usually or more tha more well was testing battery drains and charging last days and for charging it seems like to mins and thats normal as saw in too many videos but for battery drains feel it drains so fast didnt yet calculate it as im playing games as well not heavy gaming but maybe like to mins and not in row but the point its first time to use ghz display maybe its the reason and im just hyping it also im showing battery percentage in the status bar thats what makes me it feels drains faster even by every mins my brightness is half and always using hrz display also will update later when finds something interesting
Infinix,Zero 30,ho much of this phone and the pinck or yello colour available or not available every color should already be available but id recommend the rome green because of its feeling anyways it has different price everywhere so which country should check for pricing
Infinix,Zero 30,the zero is actually by far the most powerful out of these three phones ho much of this phone and the pinck or yello colour available or not available
Infinix,Zero 30,hello darling are you facing any issues with battery draining fast as mine doesnt last more well it depends mine last day easily with hours of screen on time usually or more thats on max brightness hz always on and im only using mobile data how much is your average sot
Infinix,Zero 30,unfortunatelly it doesnt hello darling are you facing any issues with battery draining fast as mine doesnt last for whole day without charging idk if its normal or not just curious and anxious
Infinix,Zero 30,it does have dedicated microsdxc card slot unfortunatelly it doesnt
Infinix,Zero 30,the difference between and is about my needs are just to have decent daily drive more decent charging speeds basically under hour for full charge in that case you have to go for the version decent display how is the display are they the same on both phones its very good and yes its the same display on both apart from the refresh rate decent daily performance streamingchrome mainly apart from the zero have note pro as well which has the same chipset as the zero and while both are decent the difference is still huge and you will notice it even if you never game never game either are the front and back cameras the same excluding the ultrawide yes but also no the main camera of the zero has ois but technically its the same sensor as the zero and the note pro for that matter zero takes much better pics tho with that in mind would you still recommend the version of this phone technically yes because its great phone for the price but the zero is the best worths the extra
Infinix,Zero 30,the chipset which is almost twice as powerful and adds the latter may not be that importa more the difference between and is about my needs are just to have decent daily driver dont care about gaming performance as dont game on my phone also for the camera im not going to take any macro shots the main camera and selfie camera are enough are the front and back cameras the same excluding the ultrawide dont think there would be major difference between and hz the charging speed doesnt bother me either as dont really have to charge very often and dont use many batteryconsuming apps to summarize what need in phone decent display how is the display are they the same on both phones decent speakers decent charging speeds basically under hour for full charge decent daily performance streamingchrome mainly with that in mind would you still recommend the version of this phone also are there any other options in this price range or is this the best option
Infinix,Zero 30,over heating is predominantly on the vegan leather variant the glass ones have better heat di more own rome green and it does not heat up more compared to the golden hour which my friend owns
Infinix,Zero 30,safe to assume that you own this phone correct me if im mistaken however need to kn more over heating is predominantly on the vegan leather variant the glass ones have better heat dissipation
Infinix,Zero 30,xb is clearly the best of them but obviously because it is the most expensive xpro is the more the zero is actually by far the most powerful out of these three phones
Infinix,Zero 30,hello could guys help me for choosing between these phones for gaming and other stuff be more xb main focus on really tough best durability while camera chipset only average zero with better camera chipset also average both not focused for serious gaming chipset
Infinix,Zero 30,from experience the display is very clear and nice looking safe to assume that you own this phone correct me if im mistaken however need to know your opinion on the physical build quality of the zero gg does it follow the expectations for this price range and have you experienced the reported overheating
Infinix,Zero 30,guys is it good for gaming like cod car xstreet rainbow six mobile
Infinix,Zero 30,stereo speakers but dolby atmos not available ppi maybe display is not clear from experience the display is very clear and nice looking
Infinix,Zero 30,okay this phone launched for pkr about usd as of today the infinix zero will more the chipset which is almost twice as powerful and adds the latter may not be that important but their power difference is still huge the zero charges faster has hz display which again may not be that important but the mp ultrawide the version has no ultrawide sure is especially because its af capable thus it cane take high quality macro shots or at least the india version can
Infinix,Zero 30,id say about usd at max do use screen protector on it yes the hydrogel typ more okay this phone launched for pkr about usd as of today the infinix zero will launch for pkr about usd what are the main differences between both phones
Infinix,Zero 30,theres big difference between the two the larger the ram the faster the unit bigg more well not necessarily ram of gb with ufs is faster than ram of gb with ufs thats analogous to an ssd vs hdd
Infinix,Zero 30,not buyingcos dont have slot for micro sdtoo bad because have good spec same
Infinix,Zero 30,an addition to my previous replies ive just received another software update on my zero zero is coming soon infinix started to reveal the existence of the phone and sadly it seems to be just zero with curved display it will come with the mp ois selfie camera from zero which dont know how much better it is in comparison to the mp ois from zero same helio curved display with hz refresh rate and probably without the ultrawide camera putting it below zero in camera department
Infinix,Zero 30,check my new question also should go for the or is there big difference or more an addition to my previous replies ive just received another software update on my zero
Infinix,Zero 30,poco not when it comes to cameras chipset storage type and display so pretty much everything
Infinix,Zero 30,another question up to what price point should buy this phone forin usd the previous inf more id say about usd at max do use screen protector on it yes the hydrogel type which we sell at the store where work at so put it on myself id say gb ram is enough thats what mine has but if there isnt huge price difference then you should go for the gb variant it can absolutely make difference as for my grammar ive learnt it while watching youtube videos of anything really not at all specifically learning content and also at school but its not my main language so can also have issues sometimes
Infinix,Zero 30,oh vegan leather of course love that rome green and it feels really good speakers are great more check my new question also should go for the or is there big difference or any benefits of going with the more ram version
Infinix,Zero 30,ill potentially buy this phone what do you think of it so far hows the bloatware more oh vegan leather of course love that rome green and it feels really good speakers are great loud and clear the phone is fast and smooth and with max everything it can easily last me full day with hours of sot but thats with max brightness always on display turned on which isnt really always on tbh but its nice to have and hz also always on which you can dial back to hz or adaptive if you need more battery life bloatware is minimal at max no ads ive already received software updates on it as well
Infinix,Zero 30,what about redmi note pro it has good camera battery and display the zero still has better cameras and much more powerful soc httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparequalcommsnapdragonsgenvsmediatekdimensity
Infinix,Zero 30,the camon premier has better cameras and slightly faster soc while the zero has prett more what about redmi note pro it has good camera battery and display
Infinix,Zero 30,this or the tecno camon premier im not gamer just want phone with good displa more the camon premier has better cameras and slightly faster soc while the zero has pretty good cameras pretty good soc slightly faster and curved display could be good or bad depends on you and faster charging prefer the zero because of the faster charging but mainly because of the curved display
Infinix,Zero 30,from what saw from reviews the stabilization on videos is absolutely wonky
Infinix,Zero 30,if they are both available for you for around the same price then the zero is much better more may ask which is better for daily driver and not really on the gaming side infinix zero or tecno camon pro
Infinix,Zero 30,how was my comment even implying that at all no thats not what meant the ultraw more can you check the part where the speaker if there is an opening or part that is not covered
Infinix,Zero 30,so do you mean the ultrawide angle does not work how was my comment even implying that at all no thats not what meant the ultrawide angle does work in fact it does jobs as it can focus very closely to take macro shots as well as wide shots
Infinix,Zero 30,thats good to know at least one more useful feature for quite few people believe more thanks ill check that out the next time want new transsion phone currently the itel is what feel like ordering but not right now
Infinix,Zero 30,yeah the sensors are much different hm for zero pro and hm for zero and gt pro bu more just got the phone and ultrawide does have af tried taking macro shots with it and it for sure can but mine is an india model so it might be weird market dependent feature
Infinix,Zero 30,is the fantasy purple option not out yet
Infinix,Zero 30,so infinix jammed pack really good specs for that price but never included proper software update support
Infinix,Zero 30,you say that you gaming person then pick the gt pro wrong suggestion dimensity is much stable than
Infinix,Zero 30,pls guy which one should go for infinix zero or infinix note vip pls iam gam more infinix note vip
Infinix,Zero 30,does in connector work on this phone like an earphone and charger in
Infinix,Zero 30,question is in connector work on this phone like an earphone and cable in
Infinix,Zero 30,fm radio but no mm jack
Infinix,Zero 30,folax is better than amazon echo
Infinix,Zero 30,by which far more premium build better screen better main camera with ois ultrawide lens better selfie camera with af better video recording with more versatile options you will lose jbl sound wireless charging and probably bypass charging from note vip its important to mention that the wireless charging works only with infinix proprietary charger and you need to buy separately you can find some special package with wireless charing pad but they are kinda rare
Infinix,Zero 30,zero is by far better than note vip by which far
Infinix,Zero 30,comparing flagship phone to mid range one some people in comment sections of tech websites are just insane or like to show off by saying nonsense
Infinix,Zero 30,unfortunatelly the main camera isnt the same as the one on the zero pro its more yeah the sensors are much different hm for zero pro and hm for zero and gt pro but was refering to the set of cameras if zero had wide lens telephoto or periscope telephoto and ultrawide with af it would be even greater btw zero pro is still available on infinix official store in aliexpress and got mine there
Infinix,Zero 30,wow it took them years to make phone thats slightly worse than regular gr more comparing flagship phone to mid range one
Infinix,Zero 30,if infinix used the cameras of zero pro main camera with ois ultrawide with autofocus more unfortunatelly the main camera isnt the same as the one on the zero pro its smaller sensor same as the one on the note pro and note vip and the gt pro but with ois even more unfortunate is that can not order it at all my usual site doesnt have it mean hope they will but not yet and no other site will ship it to where am
Infinix,Zero 30,just watched the review from techspur about this phone and am amazed of the folax ia generated by chat gpt might just buy this phone for the ai
Infinix,Zero 30,another miscalculation with lot of shine shine
Infinix,Zero 30,this is basically protest against the review affirmation regarding the camera that pixel do not get more detail it is clear we get more detail with image of the building with perforated balcony we can actually see the holes in mpx while not the reduced pixel count
Infinix,Zero 30,gsmarena team please full review some of infinix devices like this one and note vip unlike so more theyre done with lab tests cos they released benchmark scores review should be out tomorrow cos theyll do night camera test just wait day or two but sony came after infinix and they reviewed sony first
Infinix,Zero 30,infinix should start adding telephoto cameras to their phones instead of useless mp cams
Infinix,Zero 30,with mm jack even without sd card this still would be complete it does have dedicated microsdxc card slot
Infinix,Zero 30,yeahbut the thing is that the poco camera isnt as bad as you make it out to be sure its more it might sound greedy but if they want to stand out in the phone industry then thats what they have to do so in order to stand out they would need to intentionally lose money no they dont need to do any of that they are already the top smartphone vendor worldwide out of nowhere yeahbut the thing is that the poco camera isnt as bad as you make it out to be never said it was bad but its worse than the camera of the zero
Infinix,Zero 30,this smartphone no mm jack but here say yes
Infinix,Zero 30,unrealistic expectations as always the chipset is plenty powerful for the price no fps more yeahbut the thing is that the poco camera isnt as bad as you make it out to be sure its not as great as the infinix camera but its still really good howeverthere is huge gap between the performance of the poco and the infinix no one is saying the infinix is bad but they really cant go against xiaomi until they start putting better chipsets in their phones while maintaining the other specs and keeping the price okay it might sound greedy but if they want to stand out in the phone industry then thats what they have to do
Infinix,Zero 30,honestly speaking this phone has come up to challenge redmi phones and people will opt for this one infinix just need to be given year update of android version like samsung phones
Infinix,Zero 30,and even the top brand dont give dedicated sd card slot with ufs enabled and more with mm jack even without sd card this still would be complete
Infinix,Zero 30,thats because they have worse cameras than these poco is gaming focused phone but the cameras are also good for show off with large mirror
Infinix,Zero 30,deleted post euro or maybe higher or lower
Infinix,Zero 30,this looks great
Infinix,Zero 30,no disrespect but xiaomi phones have become the most overpriced phones in the market today they are losing tons of sales due to overpricing they used to rule as the budgetfriendly brand of mobiles now they are overpriced pieces of garbage with old technology sold at high prices
Infinix,Zero 30,nah dont but if they want to go against xiaomi then they probably should put the sn more thats because they have worse cameras than these
Infinix,Zero 30,complete no mm jack no sd card yea right and even the top brand dont give dedicated sd card slot with ufs enabled and with wifi and bt transferring data from any other device isnt issue like having external sd card adapter how much one needs beyond gb on one mobile of course they could give gb with gb variant and it would make it unbeatable even with inr phone but it doesnt make it less complete
Infinix,Zero 30,did you expect snapdragon gen for usd or what nah dont but if they want to go against xiaomi then they probably should put the snapdragon gen in this phone even the poco that cost slightly higher is using flagship killer chipset
Infinix,Zero 30,cpu throttling which is not good
Infinix,Zero 30,not really infinix brings some nice specs but they also flop in the chipset and performance more did you expect snapdragon gen for usd or what
Infinix,Zero 30,xiaomi is in trouble now not really infinix brings some nice specs but they also flop in the chipset and performance section
Infinix,Zero 30,cant believe people will overlook all the good value for money specs in device jist because it doesnt have an audio jack and sd card slot despite having gb and above storage options
Infinix,Zero 30,only ppi density
Infinix,Zero 30,damm excellent price with complete features complete no mm jack no sd card yea right
Infinix,Zero 30,this is where saw it is it typo httpsmgsmarenacominfinixzerophp id assume
Infinix,Zero 30,yeah but its software is obviously not going to be as good as those other brands no doubt more ive been using infinix note for the past year and it has been running smoothly no ads just few bloatwares which have uninstalled and disabled those which were unable to be uninstalled this phone has better display camera processor and performance as compared to similarly priced redmi oppo and vivo tx which costs little bit higher
Infinix,Zero 30,obviusly yeah sure buddy you havent used it before and you have no idea more price for this phone please
Infinix,Zero 30,it has mm jack and fm radio good luck xiaomi the zero unfortunatelly does not have headphone jack you can see it even in the promo videos of it that its sadly nowhere to be found
Infinix,Zero 30,this would have been perfect and complete phone with mm jack it has mm jack and fm radio good luck xiaomi
Infinix,Zero 30,wow looks really good software isnt though worse than even miui honestly as user never had any issues with xos saw that the most recent versions of xos are more fluid less intrusive and visually akin to other more known custom interfaces
Infinix,Zero 30,you talk as if youve ever used it yet you never did yeah but its software is obviously not going to be as good as those other brands no doubt about that
Infinix,Zero 30,eagerly waiting for review from gsmarena
Infinix,Zero 30,is there any mobile with mm jack under yeah those budget phones like the
Infinix,Zero 30,how many mah is your phone how many mah is your phone no
Infinix,Zero 30,yes figured such shame is there any mobile with mm jack under
Infinix,Zero 30,aug no mm jack yes figured such shame
Infinix,Zero 30,in infinix zero ir blaster available or not
Infinix,Zero 30,leaked pictures and more confirms some of the specs of zero dimensity chipset indisplay fingerprint mp ois isocell hm with lossless zoom mp ultrawide mp selfie camera with autofocus battery mah with fast charging httpstwittercompassionategeekzstatusphoto httpstwittercomtushargstatus httpstwittercomperfectgadgetstatus
Infinix,Zero 30,wonder if anyone had it downloaded dont think so but this video should surely stay up httpsyoutubeaoodmsdrmgsieolskrilzdutxb in case it doesnt the main thing that this confirms that wasnt sure prior to it is that both sides will be able to capture fps videos
Infinix,Zero 30,wow wow theyve pretty much crammed all the specs into possibly one affordable mid ran more it would obliterate xiaomi for sure
Infinix,Zero 30,unfortunatelly the video got privated which makes sense anyways it does have mp more wonder if anyone had it downloaded
Infinix,Zero 30,httpsyoutubecomshortsburcwatkmrksigqjhvugqoncu actually we pretty much know ev more unfortunatelly the video got privated which makes sense anyways it does have mp ois main camera and mp ultrawide probably with af as the third sensor is just mp depth and dimensity chipset inside and stereo speakers
Infinix,Zero 30,we dont even know the chipset or the price httpsyoutubecomshortsburcwatkmrksigqjhvugqoncu actually we pretty much know everything about it except price
Infinix,Zero 30,the design of golden hour looks cool
Infinix,Zero 30,september
Infinix,Zero 30,hope itll be better than the others
Infinix,Zero 30,when is he coming
Infinix,Zero 30,omg love this phone with hz they will like this phone
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,tried different camera the max resolution of camera is just mega pixel its not
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,near perfect light weight midrange phone just few issues proximity sensor doesnt work most of the time battery doesnt seems mah have to recharge it times day over normal social media use speaker is not that loud it couldve been better touch sometimes doesnt work due to an after market back cover which covers its edges infinix should get rid of bloatware or let ordinary user disable such apps like phone master phone cloner etc
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,inifinix phones are highly disappointing when it comes to speaker performance often more agreed
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,picture or videos skin tone in display over brightness
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,what about the ultrawide camera its good wasnt expecting ultrawide good in this phone but its good
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,got one as gift from infinix over all good budget phone here is some pros and cons pros more does it have plus
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,its just that has ois and better design thats the only two big difference
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,android upgrade is joke im sure they wont update its android version at all they will update from my experience have gotten updates from infinix before especially for note and zero series
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,new helio cpu never heard that in while lol mean it is the same as but with more nope the only difference is that it support mpx camera
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,dont understand why you guys comment about something you havent used in your life please more there are must be plenty infinix showrooms out there in your city nope there is nothing like that here but do own zero ultra
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,top tier false information right there infinix zero ultras speakers are absolutely hi more dont understand why you guys comment about something you havent used in your life pleasestop making fool of yourself get it you want to buy or will buy cheap infinix phone once you earn enough cash but stillthere are must be plenty infinix showrooms out there in your cityso you can check those out yourself and confirm yourself if am telling the truth or not and stop defending things you havent touched yet good day
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,infinix will make all the phone helio
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,same here im waiting check out infinix gt pro best value
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,its only your ears that are the problem dont turn up the volume too often close more well may bebut you havent used any infinix device in your lifeso why should listened to you year old kid
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,would buy this next year
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,ufs dimensity edition what the sigma is this
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,model but dimensity soc at least correct the name gsmarena team
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,the processor already supports but why is it called usually the is for the pro version
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,is dual speakers equavalent to stereo speakers can any one kind enough to explain it to me bro
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,the phone itself hasnt been revealed yet but theres already advertising of it on the shopping mall where work at here in maracaibo venezuela and since got to take pic of said advertisement have some of the key specs of it possibly of model as variants usually arent sold here curved amoled display with hz refresh rate and gorilla glass protection ois wide mp mp rear cameras gb storage gb ram stereo speakers tuned by jbl infrared port gopro compatible price two confirmed colors pink and green if you all want to see said advertising its in spanish though here you go httpsimgurcomgallerybraoh
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,in is crazy not really since there are still lots of places without networks heck its still not hard to find places with slow or unstable coverage in especially at rural areas
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,all dimencity chips are supported
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,gb variant wouldve been nice to have
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,but with soc what
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,infinix zero with dimensity ultimate
Infinix,Zero 40 4G,device with nanometer chipset how is that possible
Infinix,Zero 40,dear infinix when are you releasing the zero we are almost reaching september in more the infinix zero chipset is mediatek the as infinix note pro plus just overclock chipset ive seen it
Infinix,Zero 40,yes it sure is got this phone in nigeria last month and took it back to new york usa more where can get infinix zero
Infinix,Zero 40,this massive upgrade yes it sure is got this phone in nigeria last month and took it back to new york usa with me it works flawlessly with my tmobile cellphone service
Infinix,Zero 40,your phone is defective have it no problems so far please tell me what is the current version of software on your phone and what was tha last security patch date
Infinix,Zero 40,hello guys plz can know max graphics in pubg game pubg ultra hdr
Infinix,Zero 40,with the recent software update it come up with terrible post processing for still pictures very bad results of post processed faces and around noses especially infinix zero has still much much better post processing of pictures infinix plz take note and correct your terrible post processing of pictures in this mobiles if its not gonna change wil sale my phone and dont recommend it to anyone for purchase currently it is taking terribly bad face pictures
Infinix,Zero 40,my car doesnt come with android auto it comes with screen mirroring app works very well with my old poco phone but for some reason not this phone obviously tried updating and reinstalling simply not working any suggestions
Infinix,Zero 40,we really need display port for infinix zero
Infinix,Zero 40,one good thing about this phone is the processor and cameras nice work from infinix
Infinix,Zero 40,proper cam optimization many chinese phone in this price range when goin video mode they didnt have ois this one great
Infinix,Zero 40,it looks like oneplus model have and it reminded me of it but and all oneplus models in general has better battery holding and capacity compared to all other phones in my opinion
Infinix,Zero 40,honey dont buy midrange phones if you want heavy duty phone
Infinix,Zero 40,infinix phone are good but need usb for tv out put just buy google pixel or sony xperia then
Infinix,Zero 40,better to wait for zero the is still useable phone in after release then you will say wait so why not just buy it haha
Infinix,Zero 40,could somebody give me the general overall battery life when using this phone like in games more better to wait for zero the is still useable phone in
Infinix,Zero 40,telephoto camera would be great instead of uw camera
Infinix,Zero 40,no telephoto as usual personally ultrawide is very useful for travel blog compare to telephoto
Infinix,Zero 40,modern upper midrange phones like honor pro realme pro plus snd vivo pro sll have more mp ultrawide is something not seen in other mid range phone so this setup is perfectly fine if mp detail is fine enough
Infinix,Zero 40,this spec sheet is what expect on redmi note series years ago now this infinix zero caught my attention one feature short only dedicated microsd card slot will be in my list sooner or later if redmi unable to catch up next year especially on the camera modules
Infinix,Zero 40,this one or redmi note pro camera wise preferably reccomend redmi yep the module on infinix is better but optimisation features video quality battery life will be better on pro only pro if the simple pro it depends on price
Infinix,Zero 40,is that laser autofocus between camera module
Infinix,Zero 40,it has curved screen and people like me who afford phone once in or years will not buy th more they have uv glass for that
Infinix,Zero 40,buy flagship one if you need telephoto modern upper midrange phones like honor pro realme pro plus snd vivo pro sll have telephoto lenses know the zero is cheaper than the aforementioned phoned but it would be great if infinix can step up and change the game by putting telephoto lens at this price point
Infinix,Zero 40,from the image can see fourth hole is that for the ambient light sensor laser autofocus more zoom sensor when make video with flash light
Infinix,Zero 40,they should start introducing mah or mah battery and battery software updates too not only security patches and continue this clean os no more bloatwares must be able to uninstall not necessarily apps to be used
Infinix,Zero 40,wow this is the mate pro
Infinix,Zero 40,please infinix please im big fan just upgrade zero series to usb for display output really need it for university and business reasons
Infinix,Zero 40,hi between infinix zero and infinix note prowhat is different between dual and stereo more the infinix note has better sounding because it uses stereo speaker meanwhile the zero is only using dual mono speaker
Infinix,Zero 40,sadly no tele camera it is not the lack of the telephoto cam that bothers me it is the continued use of the mediocre samsung mp hm on the main cam looks like infinix bought million hm sensors that they need to put them on each and every midrange that they will release in the next years why not use the ove instead though it has lower megapixel count at mp
Infinix,Zero 40,tbh it solid one but nothing really unique saw the zero last year and was expecting beast but maybe next year or try other device just looking for best midrange
Infinix,Zero 40,finally infinix showing other brands how to make circular camera look beautiful
Infinix,Zero 40,good hardware but mediocre software
Infinix,Zero 40,its plastic its not
Infinix,Zero 40,its quite expensive here in malaysia huge price jump from the zero limreviews released video and yeah kinda expensive in malaysia as he pointed other than that the phone is gorgeous even with this circular camera module and performs better than expected the price though is kinda salty
Infinix,Zero 40,pls who knows what the build quality is plastic or alluminium its plastic
Infinix,Zero 40,from the look of the camera array it seems this phone comes with laser af sensor from the image can see fourth hole is that for the ambient light sensor laser autofocus module or what
Infinix,Zero 40,from infinix track record its plastic my dear fellow tech nerd dont think they will although they was so inconsistent in term of material theyre using for their flagships theyve already proven to use premium material for some of their flagship phones in the past the zero uses glass so its possible for them to also use glass on this phone
Infinix,Zero 40,kinda like the model design better compared to this model which somehow looks kinda crowded and cluttered especially in the camera area
Infinix,Zero 40,yeah thought they would go all out with this model gb etc the price is steep as more well id better get this one for the update policy well its just years tho nothing that much infinix really needs to be giving more updates by the way infinix doesnt have ufs phone which is interesting
Infinix,Zero 40,its an absolute beast but why the slow charging infinix yeah thought they would go all out with this model gb etc the price is steep as well feels like much better deal to get the zero
Infinix,Zero 40,think they wanted to focus on making it cheap hence the downgrade the mp depth sensor sa more its quite expensive here in malaysia huge price jump from the zero
Infinix,Zero 40,very good upgrade in soc uw with bypass and wireless charging though im not big fan of the design
Infinix,Zero 40,also the charging watts is bit downgrade tho its okay dont let me down luh
Infinix,Zero 40,ppi density is good upgrade from infinix and fps
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,still usable to this day good device for its price the speed and camera are still considered adequate if the device source for this device is released will immediately modify this device
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,my phone still working perfectly and its speed is marvelousno laggingcameras still taking very picturesam satisfied with the phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,the body curved am afraid also noticed my phone is little curved
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,still my phone is working properly and never experience lagging still the performance is good
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,this phone still good even in gaming hsr in medium graphics and ultra in mlgood battery and stable fingerprint
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,dont use this if youre into competitive gaming bad touch latency ofc its the mi fans ykwhat poco doesnt even make that good phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,octacore ghz cortexa ghz cortexa octacore ghz cortexa more the phone has two versions came with mediatek dimensity octacore ghz cortexa ghz cortexa and the other version with mediatek dimensity octacore ghz cortexa ghz cortexa xd so the phone doesnt came with core only
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,when first started using this cellphone didnt have any problems suddenly after us more the body curved am afraid
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,the back side design of this phone is nice with the arrangement of the three unit cameras and stretch down flash light placed inside raised square back case may this design be still used in the next smartphone you are going to produce it is eye catching especially myself well done infinix
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,mine zero is so lagging now in codm cant be competitive player anymore huhu don more maybe because software update mine never update the software since bought this phone and still android also play codm too and never facing any lag on my zero recommended dont update the software if your device fine because software update gacha sometimes your phone getting better and sometimes your phone getting worse
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,anyone notice the sides of their screen yellowish tint or blue its barely noticeable and more same ive got lcd burns at the corners of my screen
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,question for owners of this device how many points is the multitouch bought infinix no more it has points
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,good camera and good for gaming been using it for almost years just need phone cooler when playing to avoid fps drop
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,after using it for year and month is still worth it for me
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,just got this guy about week ago and of course ill share my thoughts for those who sti more mine zero is so lagging now in codm cant be competitive player anymore huhu dont know why its lagging now
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,is the sound quality for other good mine isnt really good but dont know if mine more no bro its really bad and the loudness is not that much
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,this is model the dimensity is not dimensity but dimensity
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,this phone comes with not this is model the dimensity is
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,does infinix zero has wide angle thank you no
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,phone goes to in minutues for honkai star rail or genshin in medium graphics becomes more yeah agree tho when im on low settings on hsr it doesnt really heat up not biased can barely play genshin when its higher than medium settings now because it constantly fps drops but think this phone can still survive when snezhnaya comes lol
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,is to normal when using tiktok
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,amoled has pwm which cause eyestrain to people sensitive to it see pwm subreddit only low frequency pwm dimming hz and below will cause noticable eyestrain higher frequency pwm dimming wont cause nearly as much eyestrain just like dc dimming
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,is the android uprgadable yes
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,never really got the lcd hate but have to admit most have become extremely poor nowadays more sorry pressed submit before was finished grays seem to glisten and some oleds shimmercolor shift lot when tilted dont get me wrong amoled is still superior in lot of other ways but still think manufacturers should offer lcd alternative for us pwm sufferers and dont think the gulf between the two technologies are as great as people let on
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,for real actually prefer ips since its more durable and you dont need to worry more amoled has pwm which cause eyestrain to people sensitive to it see pwm subreddit
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,can play max fps and medium graphics on codm codm br graphics android graphics high frame rate max still alive until today tho because my zero already have photos and only week im using it also fixes the battery drain in android which is good
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,im also having touch freeze issues and noticeable delay in touch responsiveness this more use your warranty instead mine does not have problem the fact that have stored lot of data and do gaming high res
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,im having this issue on this phone im experiencing sudden touch freeze while pl more im also having touch freeze issues and noticeable delay in touch responsiveness this is on an every day basis really frustrating the idea of buying cheap gaming phone is really tempting but its not worth the frustration every time your operator suddenly freezes midfight or suddenly swipes you out of your game you log back into the game only to find that your character has been defeateddead would never recommend
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,drwho sep from amoled your eyes will die soon ips is best for health for real actually prefer ips since its more durable and you dont need to worry about amoled burn and pink or green line
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,from amoled your eyes will die soon ips is best for health
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,display not amoled
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,this one has better cpu yeke
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,been using for months now overall its good for gaming and everyday use but the battery dra more change it from hz to hz or hz that would reduce the battery draining
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,for the battery charge it fully at night after its full then turn it off then the next morning turn it back on different from before its usually more economical and this works fine on my cellphone zero
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,stop complaining speakers if your into music use bt headphones or something more what phone would you recommend that has good camera quality and also budgetfriendly
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,buyying this phone next week hope its good and will last long

Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,wish it had ultra wide camera dual speakers and smaller size like big phones are ridicul more why did you considered an amoled as downside
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,hahaha it just got destroyed by the redmagic pro in genshin impact sustained performance wi more redmagic pro was designed for gaming those fools who say iphonegalaxy phones are good for gaming dont push their phones to the limit
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,im having third and even th thoughts about buying infinix after reading the issues in this comment section the price is scaringly low and as my chinese businessmen friend would say you get what you pay for has anyone cared to test their gps gsm arena should include this in their review and the expandable ram that many phones are having

Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,batterys pretty good how long can your battery last mine cant even last hours
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,overall experience is great but cant really ignore how fast the battery drains
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,bruh this phone is not amoled it is budget phone bro
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,bro do people not even use the phone or even read the specs and just come asking with tons of questions its giving me dont with us dbz fans we dont know anything vibes
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,screen burn in its ips lcd right and not amoled so no need to worry right yes
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,seem this phone is great
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,ufs lpddr got info in indonesia for this model has downgrade the storage type to ufs lpddr its correct
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,in some countries zero has nfc features yes in my country it has nfc
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,anyone know which storage type use emmc or ufs
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,the brightness automatically increasing while playing games is honestly getting to my nerves its the temperature thingy in the game mode settings turn it off
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,yep same think it is because of bug in software do know how to fix it even if its not permanent im getting tired of having to manually adjust it back when it automatically does that
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,just got updated by couple of friends in india that they also got version there am from pakistan and its probably the same gona be here like wtf why cant they give as advertise
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,to others that bought this phone how do fix the brightness automatically increasing while more not that have problem sense play on max but the brightness seems to be hella more picks idk in this phone this seems bad rip
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,its still depends on how you use it its more likely to have screen burned when yo more playing pubg on max brightness ingame phone screen on my hrz infinix for like always usual max hours straight for like years now pretty monster of phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,which storage type use on this infinix zero ufs ufs lpddr
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,keep hearing infinix bugs with their phone whenever they try to update do you think no upda more just bought the device update went smoothly right out of the box
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,tell me about the phone more the carmera services and the battery camera was okay based on reviews but for services looks like this phone has heckton of ads unless you know how to disable and then the software update that will or will not come after sales is nearly non existent but sure has basic warranty
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,approve of this comment its still depends on how you use it its more likely to have screen burned when you literally going to maximize the screen brightness
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,hows your battery performance many reviewers complains about its battery due to it more batterys pretty good
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,im confused between choosing the poco cellphone and this infinix zero give more pro is different story and is way recommended over this phone but for the base some might have this cheaper than this phone but with all honesty this is still better than the the only advantages would probably be the amoled and miui thats it this one whilst according to some users is plagued with battery issues packs punch with that
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,ips lcd in another flop phone bro its phone with hz wtf
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,its better than amoled if your gamer cuz everyday gaming makes amoled have burn approve of this comment
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,well it has hz and thats pretty good for budget phone better then of they put hz amoled so yeah it is really good and amazing
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,lcd lol well it has hz and thats pretty good for budget phone better then of they put hz amoled
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,lcd lol
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,did you experience some overheating issues because even though im not playing games my tempe more that depends on which environment youre in if the weather or room is currently hot then the phone also heats up fast and reaches high temperature play genshin impact in medium settings and the difference of the temperature during in the afternoon and night is so different
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,yes it over heat lot because it xiaomi team engineers behind the design to of more it doesnt heat up ive been using this phone for hours straight playing different kinds of games streaming on facebook and youtube only feel slight heat this phone is beast

Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,hi would like to us if where is this unit available shoppe
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,looks like note must be my next phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,reminiscent of the oppo pro
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,infinix mobiles will charge fine if you consume huge amount of battery and then plug it guess would recommend the charging cycle cuz im still worrying what this phones battery lifespan could happen in next years the infinix zero battery endurance is still safe if you dont stubborn enough to overuse it by charging while playing games rather stay it on hz than hz cuz its just increasing the fps im not fan of ultra smooth anyway but fps was still ok to me whenever play moba talk about the reaction time yeah increasing the hz just consume your battery even more issues about the bloatwares kinda easy to solution simply disable them or completely remove it but you need some computer or laptop to do that and it was worth it than disable cuz you save some space also tell me about the app greenify still support android so most of these bloatwares that cant be disabled dont run in the background also recommend hard reset every year so that storage like others can be lower cuz its just cache of previous version apps that you always update every week or months or even year this will make the infinix zero feels like new and fresh overall this flagudget phone still had potential its almost perfect to everyone yet its up to you if you wanna buy this midrange phone that is almost to be flagship type due to antutu score of cant say actual no so rip the grammar spent on this one
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,have reno won in raffle infinix zero although reno was stylish and have nice more very well marc
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,no dual speakers yes but it was fine for me because mostly use earphones
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,buying this phone on th ill come back here and share my opinions after week
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,thank you if only have to deal with these trash bloatwares either disable or completely rem more that issues been cleared long ago on infinix newers devices sir if not thn its region problems
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,its as the other guy said less then an hour brightness plus phone turned off the more thank you if only have to deal with these trash bloatwares either disable or completely remove them the battery endurance would be better and thus the charging speed will be improved am right after gathering information from several tech reviewers the only problem about this infinix zero was the os and battery life dont care bout the speakers because always put on headphones therefore all can say was ill definitely buy this phonesomeday was hoping if infinix decides to upgrade this phone from android because android had lot of problem that the main cause was poor battery optimization
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,would you guys tell me hows the battery endurance and how long they will fully charge fr more its as the other guy said less then an hour brightness plus phone turned off then it say around minuts and if using phone not heavily then around hour and using heavily id say around and like if your gaming heavily high load on mobile like ongoing benchmark then id say around hour and possibly
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,less than an hour bro hatting on next level
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,well thought out name for such phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,how long do you think is the lifespan of this phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,ips display is absolutely useless display instead it should be super amoled display so accordi more ips lcd is fine in case of amoled my samsung note ultra suffered from led in burn times in span of years and didnt even put brightness on high its just amoled things ips lcd is superior in terms of durability and heat dissipation and you will have no display problems until the end of its lifespan amoled is an eye candy but ips is for those who need better build quality also the reason why any rugged devices uses ips lcd screen because its better sure it would be really nice if it has amoled but since the target market for this phone is majorly for gamers in the budget section think its real win plus we game indoors so dont think outdoor brightness would really matter as much as the gaming performance
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,nice hope it comes with super amoled display this time but once if it has amoled issue youd charge more than getting repair for lcd displays
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,no nfc the box had nfc multifunctional written underneath based on tech reviewers
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,does this really have nfc if its true will buy this phone no nfc
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,ive watched many tech reviewers all of them said it can support up to gb sd card more does this really have nfc if its true will buy this phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,after the system update dts sound is not working anymore you can still choose the options for dts sound but it wont work anymore regardless of what earphoneheadset you use
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,should wait till this phone is released or buy zero secondhand my phone now is more wait for it
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,why people want amoled over lcd thought amoled has burn issue is this already solve in by the time you get amoled burnin on phones like these your battery wouldve already been degraded housing or display damaged one way or another and software outdated by months or years its budget phone designed to last years maybe years tops
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,it was way solve take look on redmi note it has zero amoled burn but amoleds have high risk of having green and pink lines look at such occurence on series except for sfe and even oneplus during that year oled is still more prone to issues being organic
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,if infinix provided snapdragon at price of to with this phone it will be great success to infinix in selling this zero
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,what is display protection knowing its infinix probably dinorex glass
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,it has microsd jack radio and ips yet you still complain about nfc fm radio audio jack sd card is essential in modern day and age with being the norm you can choose oled or ips display thats your personal choice not many people actually use the nfc and who need all those cheap cameras instead of all those worthless selfy cutout and mediocre cams on the back do it like ulefone and give us flir sensor on the back and we need depth sensor macro lens and telephoto lens with optical zoom on the back now that would make sense wouldnt it
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,took the words right out of my mouth mean infinix is moving in the right direction giv more well dymenstity along with gb ram for that price sounds really generous but there are so many flaws or cut outs it wont save day or make usuall custoemr happy buying this product and being satisfied with
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,well on first looks specs are great for bucks but on second look mpix support cam more took the words right out of my mouth mean infinix is moving in the right direction giving up the slow helio chips but they do still need lot of work
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,evening tixes the boxes untill see no nfc seriously its must this day and age it has microsd jack radio and ips yet you still complain about nfc
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,headphone jack and memory card slot while otherwise having good specs infinix has my attention mpix support cammeras lcd nits peak and charging you sounds really scary with what you want compared to what this phone have to offer
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,mm jack and microusd sd card audio jack radio ips take all my money where to buy it want it nao
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,ngl although the design was ripoff from oppo its still frickin good and look at that msd slot and jacky especially at that price and did forget to mention msd slot and jacky the only bummer for me still dont trust this brand reputation overall good job infinix
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,day buy when it will be available was searching for phone from last years with flagship processor and microsd card support but now have to settle with midrange processor never used infinix but this is going to be st one
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,same with amoled and better camera set and it may be grat phone
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,wait theres mm jack mm jack and microusd
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,if the memory is lpddr am gonna buy it
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,non amoled non mm jack non thank you wait theres mm jack
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,days again this phone is released yaygood ending
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,for me that soc was with little bit tiny little bit and the phone was zero with new name
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,any idea when it is officially being launched
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,bro you know absolutely nothing about mediatek and came here trashing them the only reason yo more and dont even talk about the durability brotha my infinix ss durability asus rog durability
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,dont care about the camera changes however theres one thing that is missing an more yes infinix zero have ufs
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,no bitkhz audio no hires audio audio memes just get dac dongle bam bit khz
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,mono or stereo
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,no nfc unacceptable
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,then do better as he said the best thing to do is to not reply to trolls paid by infinix such as you and him but that does not mean wont call bs when see it so others wont waste their money and hopes on such trash
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,yes am the mad one then do better as he said
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,seems like infinix hired people to talk positive about their trash mean even their compar more are you mad do better
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,dear gsmarena please please remove every whiny comment about amoled screen amoled fans when they are trying to say ips bad
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,primary camera ok but other mp camera is not wortg
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,if it isnt expensive then zero then am going with this
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,not really they put big numbers onto their phones but they are the weakest it is just to bra more lol not true you pay for what you get get any of their pros and you wont regret their camera is fairly good thats the only negative comment can give about their phone the rest good for every day use have their note pro upgraded to honestly we worry ourselves cuz cant tell much different with the infinix the camera brings out the clear different but the rest nothing much really one might point out the stock android on top of the samsung but honestly im not fun as always use third party speaker always use my earbud display quit impressive on the thou but the note pro isnt bad at all infact is very useable surprisingly go back to the note pro for daily use since the battery is strong battery ihv even reduce the refresh rate to hz hz by evening the battery will be around and those of us that dont use case on our phones we start feeling the heat infinix not pro use is for year still get around plus by the evening gaming not fan just social media and wait how many of us actually game of phone daily when we are busy during working days just social media check ups and ppl actually buy their low entry phone so they accuse the brand of being bad but the superior companies with low entry phones are also bad
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,this is only one dimensity phone with sd card slot and headphone jack than realme pro and redmi note pro and plus model
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,another disappointment how hard is it to put an amoled screen
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,nice it has basic features like headphone jack and expandable storage ill still keep more youd still want to serve that infinix as secondary device
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,just why phone is tooo tallshould have make it around xmm
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,we cannot pay more than inr in india for this device there is upcoming redmi and realme number series which more worth than this
Infinix,Zero 5G 2023,make it really big oled screen not too thick body and ill bite
Infinix,Zero 5G,hi just want to confirm something got my infinix zero got this around think more same problem happen with me it never fell in ground or water but still my fingerprint sensor is not working also setting is also missing and restrarting doesnt change anything is there amy solution
Infinix,Zero 5G,still rocking this midrange powerhouse in the main and selfie cameras grab stellar pictures even without gcam no issues with battery life get about hrs sot on extensive use never regret bit by sticking to android
Infinix,Zero 5G,after using both of this phone version mean and version found something that the version is the best imo the camera is such downgrade on version yet it has better chipset than the version but all want to say is has the best features than the speaker is still awful in both version
Infinix,Zero 5G,android version update release date not gonna happen even if it was coming id stay on updating to newer os may be great for better security but not gonna be completely free of bugs like the buggy update but we can always dream
Infinix,Zero 5G,sir maam have nice day would like to known if message or text have multiple language france chinese korea japanese etc especialy hand writing text for message
Infinix,Zero 5G,join the infinix zero telegram community for instructions how to roll back to android fingerprints unavailable after update
Infinix,Zero 5G,you should fixed the every time played call of duty mobile or any online games and one major problem that encountered most of the time is that while playing in the middle of the game it suddenly goes back to the home screen and need to relog it so that can finish my game additionally would suggest that on the next update it should be focused on enhancing the gaming experience and the features of the phone especially the protection or the firewall of the phone to protect the users information of unknown viruses hope that the next update would be able to help and have good experience for the users
Infinix,Zero 5G,terrible network reception almost useless without access to wifi ill never buy an infinix again
Infinix,Zero 5G,got mine and like it very smooth the performance and specs are bigbamm for its price ps sorry for my english
Infinix,Zero 5G,well this is great phone working like charm didnt encountered any issues till now have one query has anybody tried using gb or tb microsd card in this phone am looking to upgrade storage by purchasing microsd card but gb looks little less so was looking for bigger option like gb or tb but its mentioned that this phone only supports gbbut have seen many phones with same configuration supporting even tb card one example of that is tecno pova gso can we use gb or tb card with this phone someone please answer me
Infinix,Zero 5G,after months of using infinix ive encounter lot of issues my apps automatically clos more have had the infinix zero for about year it works well and play game on it too have no issues at all in fact have used infinix phones for the past years and they all worked fine the only issues is after years the battery becomes weak and am unable to get genuine battery replacement so end up replacing the phone

Infinix,Zero 5G,in my country we can get infinix zero at the price very good deal for dimens more last update november no updates after that
Infinix,Zero 5G,not phone worth staying with infinix still stays trash my current device coming from huawei nova pro this hone gives me so many random issues that regret getting it coupleed with the android its just allround bad experience
Infinix,Zero 5G,what you expect if you turn on all the notification apps and put the brightness on high with more how long have been used the phone bro
Infinix,Zero 5G,which of the clock it is normal mobile
Infinix,Zero 5G,people in other regions apart from india have received the notification for the android upd more just updated my infinix zero but the wall clock is not displaying
Infinix,Zero 5G,not really have been using this for months its battery drains very fast display is not as more using this mobile for last six months the worst phone in entire mobile industry nameless chinese set works better than this mobile mobile switchs off suddenly call drop happens very frequently it reebots automaticaly and service centre never responds unwanted notification of xos most important recently activated think infinix has duplicate software was unable to make calls during network should manually change it to and make calls call history is not working the most useless phone in this world have been forced to buy second mobile
Infinix,Zero 5G,think hard reset is the only way warning make sure you have backed up all your files be more phone reset didnt revert to android
Infinix,Zero 5G,who is thinking about switching to the just released version of this phone definitely not me can ask you why
Infinix,Zero 5G,watch youtube comment say this phone will auto restart few times in day is that true yeah its true but that is part of the setting where can switch it off so its not big deal
Infinix,Zero 5G,thats not the phone update we were looking for lol exactly they missed the amoled screen again infinix never listens
Infinix,Zero 5G,after update to android experience many bugs unstable refresh rate heating issues no sound when done charging ram problem with screen recording no internal sound from this update hope this fix it soon
Infinix,Zero 5G,performance really bad drop in performance fps lot of fps drop even when scrolling in more forgot that there is increased time in charging idk why but it takes longer to charge than before
Infinix,Zero 5G,have you tried factory reset after the update yep nothing happened and its been week can only play ml smoothly in smooth graphics super refreshrate wild rift smoothly in lowest settings possible and fps and other games that can play with great settings is not really playable
Infinix,Zero 5G,yes indeed after android update the phone is slow have you tried factory reset after the update
Infinix,Zero 5G,update android yesterday at ph give us performance review im hearing reports of lag after update
Infinix,Zero 5G,android in infinix zero hoax android is already available but see slight lag when regular usage compared to android also new issue appear like frequently disconnect when connect to pc
Infinix,Zero 5G,help problem in connecting with my pc windows its keeps on disconnecting im too having same problem after updating android
Infinix,Zero 5G,android indonesian usser
Infinix,Zero 5G,can install the beta version of android even if im from the philippines cuz android update can only be seen in infinix india websites
Infinix,Zero 5G,which country you from indonesia
Infinix,Zero 5G,my zero has update android bro how did you get the update and what has been the experience so far
Infinix,Zero 5G,mdavin aug does it overheat on my experience using this couple month yess this phone is very hot for gaming when using camera get used to it because in think this phone will not caught up with other system
Infinix,Zero 5G,infinix lie about android update and why you believe it please in this price range do not hope too many wishes it will bring you down bro
Infinix,Zero 5G,my infinix zero pro overheats so quickly after using genshin for mins the heat is really bothering me even if set it at hz dont know why but think im still covered with the days warranty
Infinix,Zero 5G,this phone sucks if only know that would not receive any updates in the future device fo more this phone is awesome for me
Infinix,Zero 5G,best phone for me the camera is good the display is great and the ultra fast rocks this is the best bang for buck phone in the market today highly recommended
Infinix,Zero 5G,when will there be infinix zero enjoyed using zero
Infinix,Zero 5G,anyone here know how much the extendable memory
Infinix,Zero 5G,does it overheat
Infinix,Zero 5G,sir when come update android update
Infinix,Zero 5G,agustus
Infinix,Zero 5G,android infinix zero when here we go
Infinix,Zero 5G,when update to android
Infinix,Zero 5G,whens the next update this month hopefully no word from infinix yet though
Infinix,Zero 5G,between the zero and camon premier which one should buy and help dimensity is way better than
Infinix,Zero 5G,pls guys dont know maybe should choose zero zero camon premier or maybe you will more do your research and choose phone based on your preferences but can tell you that among the phones you mentioned the zero is the best in performance and speed
Infinix,Zero 5G,only nits with ips lol and without dual speaker guys dont fall for hype this brand more this phone is one of the best phones to recommend if your budget is not that big specifically for gaming because this phone has dimensity which can play almost any games low settings in demanding games such as genshin impact grid autosport etc the only cons are bad display it looks paleblueish low brightness level camera its ok considering the price but its not good for me speakers it doesnt have dual speakers and it also dont sound too good but enough for people who are not picky this phone is still one of the best phone around this price range
Infinix,Zero 5G,can anyone close to infinix could tell me who designs the xos software like is it nigeria france or honkong researched but couldnt find alot
Infinix,Zero 5G,isnt the infinix zero selfie camera can do fps ive seen videos on youtube that the selfie camera able to do
Infinix,Zero 5G,okay so here in pakistan the updates we getting are full of bugs mean note after updat more ok thats for note believe but the recent update for zero is stable no notable bugs
Infinix,Zero 5G,stupid ips lcd prefer lcd over over saturated oled that flickers burns in
Infinix,Zero 5G,no memfusion or any update you just need fan directed at the back of your phone when pla more tx bro that totally makes sense
Infinix,Zero 5G,interesting hv seen some yt reviews and gi was buttery smooth in low setting wer more no memfusion or any update you just need fan directed at the back of your phone when playing gi know its sound dumb but it works for me theres preintsalled app in this phone called xarena think that helps too
Infinix,Zero 5G,can play genshin in highest graphics with this phone so highly recommend this interesting hv seen some yt reviews and gi was buttery smooth in low setting were on extended memfusion ram enabled to achieve the highest gfx hv installed any security updates for xos yet
Infinix,Zero 5G,the find xxs cheaper sibling
Infinix,Zero 5G,is the update region specific yes there are different build numbers but it seems like those in india already have this update
Infinix,Zero 5G,just installed the update everything seems fine okay so here in pakistan the updates we getting are full of bugs mean note after updating whatsapp feature just vanished ndly in security features finger print sensor seems like it never existed this is way too much disappointment
Infinix,Zero 5G,xharglv did you buy yours in india yes
Infinix,Zero 5G,build number is xharinfkv whats yours xharglv did you buy yours in india
Infinix,Zero 5G,please whats the current build version for your zero build number is xharinfkv whats yours
Infinix,Zero 5G,did not receive updates yet please whats the current build version for your zero
Infinix,Zero 5G,just saw system update what anyone installed the update did not receive updates yet
Infinix,Zero 5G,sounds little bit heavy but it feels pretty light in reality fingers crossed on android update to sort the hdr bug out and not bring more bugs the best budget phone regardless hands down
Infinix,Zero 5G,wheres super amoled screen buy samsung if looking for amoled panel
Infinix,Zero 5G,its powerhouse and comparing the prize of the phone it the best option to go with since more iabsolutely agree with you bro
Infinix,Zero 5G,with money guess its powerhouse and comparing the prize of the phone it the best option to go with since even some flagship mobiles dont give you this type of performance
Infinix,Zero 5G,mine is grayish too and the cameras result is so ugly cant stand it though my friend have this phone too yeah the camera looks grainy and yellowish infinix comes with nice specs but doesnt quite deliver in term of quality
Infinix,Zero 5G,might just be poor ips panel they used at least they have dimensity
Infinix,Zero 5G,dont now if its my unit but noticed the screens black colors are slight more might just be poor ips panel they used
Infinix,Zero 5G,these issues can be corrected with system update we need way to inform infinix of these more agree
Infinix,Zero 5G,generally if screen is grey when turned off that screen is plasma make sure youve gotten legit infinix and that the screen is ips like it says
Infinix,Zero 5G,try downloading google camera go lite version of gcam it somehow made an improve more thanks for this downloaded from apkmirror
Infinix,Zero 5G,wish they make sized phones with this soc is too big for me
Infinix,Zero 5G,totally agree performance is solid but camera and screen colors are terrible one can only more try downloading google camera go lite version of gcam it somehow made an improvement in my pics
Infinix,Zero 5G,better than xiaomi note garbage series currently im using redmi note rn nothing garbage happen on my phone for month
Infinix,Zero 5G,and its actually cheaper than xiaomis note pro with garbage sd really garbage base on experience optimization is better than just having good cpu so dont know why people think cpu is all that matters
Infinix,Zero 5G,hahahaha thats right and its actually cheaper than xiaomis note pro with garbage sd
Infinix,Zero 5G,im still using my huawei mate pro model in and this phone has only more because your phone has oled screen this one is lcd
Infinix,Zero 5G,when is launching in indonesia
Infinix,Zero 5G,just pay more and find other brands if want better specs stop asking for more and still want more will not be worth it probably unless chip claims of and same pricing are true
Infinix,Zero 5G,with nits display you cant see anything on that unless you live in cave im still using my huawei mate pro model in and this phone has only nits too but can see the content clearly under direct sunlight come on guy
Infinix,Zero 5G,omg still ips lcd display omg this is now bro look at that price and think what they can give is already good phone with such an affordable price so if want oled pay more and get different phone
Infinix,Zero 5G,bought one solid performance smooth display and good battery life also looks good with nova launcher somehow the nigerian variant doesnt have the flash notification feature had to use third party app for that
Infinix,Zero 5G,seems to attend my daily and work usage will get one if released in brasil also that fake more yes me too
Infinix,Zero 5G,finally infinix uses dimensity not series nice movement infinix
Infinix,Zero 5G,hey your phone has ips nits and you are not life in cave my phone has nits and still think its not that good you cant lie yourself even gsmarena thinks the display is terrible
Infinix,Zero 5G,nice move by infinix great specs with reasonable price tag hope infinix will release tablet with stylus to accompany its smartphones and laptops line up
Infinix,Zero 5G,finally better than xiaomi with nits display you cant see anything on that unless you live in cave
Infinix,Zero 5G,infinix zero supports mhl
Infinix,Zero 5G,just like oppo find series have bump camera
Infinix,Zero 5G,finally dimensity and this look promising
Infinix,Zero 5G,waited for this phone just to find it has ips lcd my disappointment is immeasurable and my more funny dude
Infinix,Zero 5G,does it suffer from pwm flicker
Infinix,Zero 5G,love infinix so many great options such as call recording on whatsapp but miss amoled here
Infinix,Zero 5G,most comments here are hateful the smartphone looks good for its price and most smartphone brands nowadays are copying each others outward design and the like smartphone brands mainstream ones have their own style if forgot some brands feel free to add apples iphone googles pixel gaming smartphones huaweis mate and series nokias smartphones oppos and reno series sonys smartphone line samsung galaxy line xiaomis former mi now just number line vivos and series googles pixel gaming smartphones
Infinix,Zero 5G,small brand like to copy bigger brand to survive
Infinix,Zero 5G,they are copying oppos design principles better than oppothis is way better than the more camera design look like find pro xiaomi bruh
Infinix,Zero 5G,wasting money camera design like oppo find prohahhmadefaker
Infinix,Zero 5G,nice one love infinix phones
Infinix,Zero 5G,impact nice and interesting phone but the price should be affordable
Infinix,Zero 5G,huge disappointment and overpriced in nigeria
Infinix,Zero 5G,mah battery or mah both are mantion in specification
Infinix,Zero 5G,excellent smartphone from infinix waiting for it decent cpu nice screen modern desi more well see if youll keep the same opinion when you see the price dont believe that bs it will be at least for that price you can get realme gt master edition or mi lite ne
Infinix,Zero 5G,sagem now infinix would always be my best phone thanks infinix
Infinix,Zero 5G,better than other companies knows how to make phones as per customer requirements happy to see telephoto camera but should have optimisied properly
Infinix,Zero 5G,but that nits display is the only cons from this phone
Infinix,Zero 5G,if was mm then thinking about buy it for was right
Infinix,Zero 5G,at last something worth the money from infinix
Infinix,Zero 5G,find pro
Infinix,Zero 5G,what design lovely so beautiful especially in black
Infinix,Zero 5G,interesting
Infinix,Zero 8,this phone never received single major update despite so good hardware was provided to this by the company stuck on android version which does not support many delivery apps like mcdonalds delivery app etc very disappointing that this phone never received an major software update
Infinix,Zero 8,why theres is no app cloner or xclone in this phone
Infinix,Zero 8,the infinix zero is undoubtedly good phone especially for its price range it stands out with its sleek design vibrant hz display and excellent performance for daily tasks and gaming thanks to the mediatek helio gt chipset the mp mp dual selfie cameras and the mp quad rear cameras are also impressive for photography enthusiasts however it does have its flaws the biggest drawback is the lack of software upgrades beyond android which limits access to the latest android features and security updates additionally the phones bloatware and average battery optimization might bother some users despite these issues its still solid option if youre not overly concerned about software longevity
Infinix,Zero 8,years of using but still in good condation
Infinix,Zero 8,is anyone still using this phone im still using this phone
Infinix,Zero 8,is your infinix zero fingerprint option available is it working mine is not working and more the same thing happened to my phone
Infinix,Zero 8,no gps where does it say no gps it says positioning gps right there in the listed specs
Infinix,Zero 8,disappointed with the infinix total lineup they never cared bout the gps feature most of the more no gps
Infinix,Zero 8,my phone lost how to get my phone back
Infinix,Zero 8,the wifi connection sucks got good wifi still the connection is fcked up

Infinix,Zero 8,the infinix zero is nicei using the phone presently and is functioning well
Infinix,Zero 8,also like the latest hot gaming would come naturally as the helio is topnotch processor
Infinix,Zero 8,side mounted fingerprint issue fck
Infinix,Zero 8,worst phone rd class camera rd glass display and very bad for gaming suddenly stuck during pubg

Infinix,Zero 8,very superb phone with infinix the future is now
Infinix,Zero 8,forget it am also using zero infinix are known for not giving android update this is th more its sweet and splendour using the infinix zero all combinationally blast and cant comprehend if they infinix mobility havent made such telecommunication gadget its wow love it with passion
Infinix,Zero 8,dont know if they want to release android for this phone or not definitely not
Infinix,Zero 8,funny that my friend was going to buy this to replace his aging huawei phone but he cancelled it for the poco pro which is good choice
Infinix,Zero 8,same issue here the camara specification is overrated the front camara is so dark when doi more the battery is mah is small
Infinix,Zero 8,please ifinix should increase their back light because you cant even see anything in ur phone on the average sun light thats the only thing have seen
Infinix,Zero 8,bro have also this same issue what should do same issue here the camara specification is overrated the front camara is so dark when doing whatsapp video call please something should be done thank you
Infinix,Zero 8,not goodcamera is not up to the mark infinix note and note is so good
Infinix,Zero 8,no bro zero is killing smartphone rather than note pro is gaming phone but type of more nice phone but comparison to note its not good one note is far better than this one
Infinix,Zero 8,am using zero proi wanted to swamp it with zero pro but the kind of messages am reading more from next year when even phones with gb ram will be using android you will remain on android and feel obsolete apps will be like bro update your phone now
Infinix,Zero 8,budget phone with excellent design and performance especially battery life it is worth th more pathetic ever phone ive ever bought just once updated since last six months pathetic gallery features was hoping bugs and software will get fixed with updates but here we go only one update which literary had nothing in it wasted money hopefully you wont
Infinix,Zero 8,very true from the the time infinix introduced ai into their camera their camera quality is more as have seen the zero think its good one but more improvement on camera and battery on the next product
Infinix,Zero 8,you can for oppo products they are strong and reliable but more expensive oppos are overprice same as vivo if you want specs price go for infinix or xiaomi poco
Infinix,Zero 8,can someone convince me to buy the zero horrible comment through out really need ram ph more you can for oppo products they are strong and reliable but more expensive
Infinix,Zero 8,bro how to fix its front cam issue when we open social media app how
Infinix,Zero 8,great phone the best phone and specifications you can have for below price gb ram storage pixel camera helio gt processor malig mc graphics which is equivalent to adreno the only downside is it doesnt have gorilla glass very good overall satisfied costumer
Infinix,Zero 8,all infinix latest phones are poor on cameras hot hot zero note all cameras esp more very true from the the time infinix introduced ai into their camera their camera quality is very poor remember using infinix hot in those times and that phone was superb selfie camera could even capture dots on ur face
Infinix,Zero 8,great mobile overall too bad no notification led sometimes selfie video is out of sync no possibility to mark pic or video as favorite when you play video of gallery it is an auto play and as soon as you click on video it plays it no possibility to cut video or play it slow motion
Infinix,Zero 8,no slow motion are you sure of what youre saying or you dont have one and youre asking us
Infinix,Zero 8,zero is too old to compare with the awesome zero the latest version
Infinix,Zero 8,zero has real problem with notification of snapchat as it deosnt ring or pop any notification when chatting or getting messsages at most time
Infinix,Zero 8,just bought new infinix zero for my wife will post an update regarding on my pov of the phone in weeks time
Infinix,Zero 8,infinix zero or pico my priorities gaming performance software optimization more poco for sure ive it in my hand at the moment and its the device you are looking for as per your requirements dual speakers qualcomm snapdragon its the only phone which has this chipset at the moment camera result is vgood and performance is excellent as it has hz refresh rate
Infinix,Zero 8,try turning of hdr in the camera app infinix zero sir where can voters do this
Infinix,Zero 8,why infinix zero cant be extreme smooth on pubg mobile even though already using the more try gfx tool to enable it
Infinix,Zero 8,fingers crossed infinix will announce that the zero and the note will receive android update cant wait folks
Infinix,Zero 8,pls do anyone knows why the zero dont receive updates security patch is still at octo more my infinix zero received security patch with dated nov
Infinix,Zero 8,why my zero cant update to xos
Infinix,Zero 8,it has fps display and hz touch rate can any user tell me how good is its touch sensitivity
Infinix,Zero 8,get iphone pro max no cap brono cap
Infinix,Zero 8,why can you please specify which model you are using
Infinix,Zero 8,bought it week ago infinix zero pathetic screen quality very dim display and not visible in day light even in indoor use we have adjust brightness to and out door almost and still the person struggle to view the screen not recommended out side usage and ppl who consume video contents as screen quality is cheap and dim else everything is ok specially the speed software experience and gis of ram perform well
Infinix,Zero 8,im going to buy mid range phone today should get it
Infinix,Zero 8,did you get any gcam or other app that improves the quality of the camera also want tips on how to make the phone more powerful
Infinix,Zero 8,depth sensors are not needed portrait mode can be done with software
Infinix,Zero 8,dont get your hopes high because infinix will never push android to the zero too much disappointed
Infinix,Zero 8,im waiting and so excited dont get your hopes high because infinix will never push android to the zero
Infinix,Zero 8,when android available for zero im waiting and so excited
Infinix,Zero 8,bro please recommend some other good product for me that has good battery good camera bette more samsung
Infinix,Zero 8,bro you are correct but not samsung are mediocre but xiaomi beats infinix and dont more bro please recommend some other good product for me that has good battery good camera better storage capacitythat easily affordable too
Infinix,Zero 8,seems like the problem is from your face im just saying tho hahaha
Infinix,Zero 8,wow so many tecno and haters has gathered here but must say that infinix is providing best more bro you are correct but not samsung are mediocre but xiaomi beats infinix and dont forget this infinix is the best infinix apart from zero which failed terribly cause of its pricing have no complain about it but poco nfc isnt joke comparing to this but ill still recommend most phones from infinix but cant buy myself cause have alternatives which are either cheaper or powerful but we shouldnt exegerate sell and review phones
Infinix,Zero 8,correct broh always this people have been complaining with non sense issuesthey just want inf more this one cant be compared with likes of xiaomi in camera and performance but not as bad as this guy say it did well against mi note which beats iphone pro cameras only down side is colour rendition best infinix phone so far infinix in general fail in terms of software optimization but this one am yet to test am long term reviewer
Infinix,Zero 8,like phone buh when people see camera design they think camera and would be so clear nd would start to compare it with their phones feel bad when other phones camera bought at lower price take good pictures than mine thier phone camera pixels are better
Infinix,Zero 8,all of above are just stupid criticswho hate infinix and tecno productswhy cant ap more have compared camera to other phones like camon or even oppo they beat dis infinix like mad and infinix has more specs than they have
Infinix,Zero 8,honestly wtf is infinix doing with the camera design in their phones its like crazy
Infinix,Zero 8,dont recommend this phone if you can get poco nfc for the same price you should get poco poco have better screen battery camera better ui and security patch
Infinix,Zero 8,highly recommend device for under buyer am impressed with performance plays call of duty mobile with max graphics of game it offered game with no lag no frame dropcamera is excellent too
Infinix,Zero 8,nice mobile phone
Infinix,Zero 8,they cant give an oled display to this flagship can never buy an infinix phone they used ips to cut the coat
Infinix,Zero 8,redmi note pro doesnt support hdr in pubg supports was playing in hdr settings
Infinix,Zero 8,material degrades but thats not making it slower if have motorcycle from years ago more what wow its very you already
Infinix,Zero 8,thats because windows is heavier and have more features and machines do slow down more material degrades but thats not making it slower if have motorcycle from years ago still can run it exactly the same speed with new same motorcycle im technician and it consultant have already tested almost every machine tell me how is the same component will decrease it speed gradually it will not it is not road that will decrease when use it often ure not even touching the hardware when use the phone and it is sealed so almost every dust cant reach it in the phone apple itself said phone speed was was from software optimization try redmi note miui it is so slowed but when it is updated to miui it is much faster can check gaming performance on miui and from youtube if dont have the device why the phone feel little slowed after years it is because everytime
Infinix,Zero 8,do they sell these in america
Infinix,Zero 8,the gb ram can handle it just avoid placing your graphic settings to max avoid max settings
Infinix,Zero 8,bad cameras get iphone pro max
Infinix,Zero 8,think its time for infinix to go for other chipset which are more stronger in perfomance
Infinix,Zero 8,no youre the wrong one software that degraded the speed not chipset if dont more thats because windows is heavier and have more features and machines do slow down every material degrades with time but software stays the same its just codes that makes the ohone works
Infinix,Zero 8,nope its the chipset performance that decreases in performance just like how battery de more no youre the wrong one software that degraded the speed not chipset if dont know how the company do it look at the news about apple slowing down old iphones with sending software updates to decrease their speed and many companies do the same to make old phone users to change to new one hardware cant be degraded its just machine but software can optimize hardware to slowing down time to time if want to test it use your old notebook with windows and windows will feel the different with win your old notebook can run any apps properly but in win your old notebook will slow down bit
Infinix,Zero 8,hey get the camon premiere or poco infinix zero is perfect no lags at all and battery life is superb
Infinix,Zero 8,please mention the rom storage type ufs or emmc emmc unfortunately
Infinix,Zero 8,id rather get the poco hey get the camon premiere or poco
Infinix,Zero 8,best phone in the world go for it
Infinix,Zero 8,fyi im ace player in pubg so never compromise on performance chipsets don more nope its the chipset performance that decreases in performance just like how battery degrade with time
Infinix,Zero 8,im talking about this from my own experience cant just say something out of the more fyi im ace player in pubg so never compromise on performance chipsets dont become weaker in months or even years if your phone performance decreased the real problem was the os of your phone poor os like xiaomis miui and xos bad for performance and battery phones with oppo color os realme os huawei emui and harmony os and android one are best if you want your phone to perform good in long term
Infinix,Zero 8,just add nfc and its perfect
Infinix,Zero 8,infinix tecno itel doesnt support future major os update except their android one phone more well even though these phones of infinix tecno and itel doesnt have is updates but am sure they are the best its camera and power they are my preference
Infinix,Zero 8,how can compare vivo with infinix infinix is toy for where vivo dey is like comparing ben more oga make research first check about the cpu
Infinix,Zero 8,almost same specifications with vivo but has more processorcpu capacity than this more you really do not know the difference between sd and gt chipset the chipset on the infinix zero has better cpu speed faster gpu clock speed higher ram speedthe chipset on the zero is far better than the chipset on vivo
Infinix,Zero 8,they havent mentioned it but dont think so this is miraculous phone it has the best features of any phones that have ever used before which mean by samsung
Infinix,Zero 8,thats big lie well you said according to you am using mediatek device for almost two more it also depends which chipset youre using too
Infinix,Zero 8,will consider infinix phones the moment they will have phones with snapdragon chipset and more need the infinix zero
Infinix,Zero 8,if you hv bn using redmi products infinix products wll know big differences ws one more recommend xiaomi any day
Infinix,Zero 8,tecno camon premier infinix zero both are same phone only different in back outer body really
Infinix,Zero 8,no nfc really nfc is feature not many countries or people use lmao
Infinix,Zero 8,selfie cam is better than the normal one infinix logic the main one is the sony imx sensor mp the front is mp not sonys use gcam do you like being blatantly wrong
Infinix,Zero 8,nonesense comments here are consider as cancer player in ml hahahah btw infinix phones is good for ml actually no lags no framedrops go infinix infinix note
Infinix,Zero 8,clearly nonesense comment infinix compare xiaomi just simple as your xiaomi compare to my ip more infinix phones is mostly budget friendly phones my infinix note is quiet good use as second phone my iphone not so very
Infinix,Zero 8,great design with terrible software and bad camera true
Infinix,Zero 8,no it isnt but its better than cant compare it to nt to talk of
Infinix,Zero 8,dont infinix downgrades the camera quality with every update if you hv bn using redmi products infinix products wll know big differences ws one of biggest fan of infinix tecno now until friend introduced me to to xiaomiredmi product always go for infinix note series flagships devices zero series since then never returned back hv never regretted of using xiaomi or redmi products can compare dz infinix flagship device to ordinary redmi note which is midrange smartphone not to talk about their flagship redmi mi ultra they hv beta chips greater processors superior camera quality beta battery performance far greater display far beyond screen protection infrared blasters finally durability
Infinix,Zero 8,its totally rubbish whit that kind of battery mah whats wrong with mah
Infinix,Zero 8,even charging notification is missing if present how do you set it up have tried but in va more its totally rubbish whit that kind of battery mah
Infinix,Zero 8,it has but for charging only so think it is useless how is it useless
Infinix,Zero 8,why screen protection not mentioned normally tecno uses neg nippon electric glass aka made in japan and good quality but not as good as the latest gorilla glass
Infinix,Zero 8,redmi note pro and realme are both much much better option
Infinix,Zero 8,mtk not good for gaming it is good for gaming
Infinix,Zero 8,trying to look smart hes kinda true acrually
Infinix,Zero 8,nice battery with battery lifeconsidering this phone is using mm cpu inch more so many companies does that especially lenovo huawei
Infinix,Zero 8,nm with heliogt weird its will reduce the performance of the processor the manufactirimg process comes from the chip manufacturer not the phone maker
Infinix,Zero 8,lot of bloatware in their os and you cant uninstall them not recommended you can always complie them in folder and put them far from eye level youre never gonna bother ever again
Infinix,Zero 8,who will get me this amazing phone will
Infinix,Zero 8,is the display screen protected by corning gorilla glass really like the design of this phone and specs looks decent
Infinix,Zero 8,not really that persons right its quite straight forward the smaller the silico more ik but he said it in way that makes everyone think that he has the biggest brain also nanometres isnt everything there is also ipc and some cpus are better tuned better silicon then the others so ik heb was right but he couldve just said nmnm for power efficiency because you cant really compare these two cpus by nanometres alone
Infinix,Zero 8,wen it going to be launched in uganda am waiting
Infinix,Zero 8,first infinix use type even zero had usb typec back in
Infinix,Zero 8,finally usb
Infinix,Zero 8,wait minute its endurance rating is hr with the mah battery also the more hz is not working properly and colors are bad and software is also unpolished garbage with lots of weird apps plastic body and frame cameras are poor only the battery is decent yeah
Infinix,Zero 8,not you can say inline with
Infinix,Zero 8,woww finally not helio again and again and again good job infinix mp sony imx is the latest sensor
Infinix,Zero 8,thats true imo think tecno isnt even competing infinix and tecno are one so they are not supposed to compete
Infinix,Zero 8,swear infinix are making good phones so far better than tecno thats true imo think tecno isnt even competing
Infinix,Zero 8,hope there is pro version with higher specs go infinix you can do it
Infinix,Zero 8,this chip is better in perfomance than snapdragon no it isnt but its better than
Infinix,Zero 8,redmi note is cheaper and better
Infinix,Zero 8,how much in uganda shillings
Infinix,Zero 8,how much of money tsh
Infinix,Zero 8,think that it has the imx due to the sensor size it is
Infinix,Zero 8,did just see typec with fast chargibg and recording from infinix or am looking at different phone
Infinix,Zero 8,total advancementinfinixs has totally listened
Infinix,Zero 8,everything about the phone is amazing infinix just changed the game for me cant wait for infinix hot
Infinix,Zero 8,the mtk gt is reliable chipset its not bad but you cant say its reliable its been only year
Infinix,Zero 8,is it ok display with amoled hz refresh rate super amoled hdr display with hz refresh rate is best
Infinix,Zero 8,not even snapdragon processor the mtk gt is reliable chipset
Infinix,Zero 8,you people should make your battery capacity to be or we want long lasting battery please
Infinix,Zero 8,plz launch zero pro with super amoled hdr display gb ram and gb internal storage more is it ok display with amoled hz refresh rate
Infinix,Zero 8,not fan here but the specs makes me say that this could be my favorite budget phone of the year have frienda who have infinix most of their phone specs suck but this one is an exemption if this is amoled dont know what to say
Infinix,Zero 8,infinix have good phones but there lack battery and that should be the major aim
Infinix,Zero 8,yes gorilla glass but third generation is it how can know because the company didnt tell that
Infinix,Zero 8,finally infinix has made phone can use the usbc port was long awaited just slap third party launcher nova on it and you are good to go nice one
Infinix,Zero 8,battery capacity less than amh are less durable and reliable
Infinix,Zero 8,at last infinix grows into mid ranger phone
Infinix,Zero 8,infinix is excellent mobile company like it so muchi advise for more improvement
Infinix,Zero 8,brilliant design
Infinix,Zero 8,when would it be in nigeria from of september guess

Infinix,Zero 8,mp selfie camerawow ist phone with inbuilt mp selfie camer not flip
Infinix,Zero 8,zero that is the phone have been waiting for the last time used it was zero thank more im still using the zero pro gb ram gb rom and am really enjoying it will wait to see the zero pro specification
Infinix,Zero 8,another monster phone we are still thinking of how to get note zero is already out more yes ooooo
Infinix,Zero 8,zero ni how much
Infinix,Zero 8,awesome phone nicely done infinix
Infinix,Zero 8,this people will not kill us some people are still saving money little by little to get zer more some of us just bought note and were seeing zero this life no balance at all
Infinix,Zero 8,extremely slick phone well done infinix
Infinix,Zero 8,had heard about this company about months ago wasnt too interested in this company this phone is like mood changer love the design cause it looks so good better than any flagship hope this becomes the best selling phone of atleast of budget category will buy it after the phone launches mainly cause of the design
Infinix,Zero 8,battery should be at least mah
Infinix,Zero 8,nice product they moved up with gb gt keep it up hoping to see amoled fhd soon
Infinix,Zero 8,saw the influence of nokia on the back typical of fanboyism
Infinix,Zero 8,infinix zero beautiful camera design but seems infinix comes with invisible expiry date not fan though cant come to and never
Infinix,Zero 8,wow the specs are amazing for its price the design looks unique and premium like it came from the future yet keeping it simple infinix is doing great job so far
Infinix,Zero 8,mpxels selfie camera did you see that is that for real mp selfie cam
Infinix,Zero 8,same realme spec pealse compare infnix zero
Infinix,Zero 8,literally infinix surprised me and if think it surprised others through this device think this is the better than realme
Infinix,Zero 8,the real flagship killer
Infinix,Zero 8,headphone jack no
Infinix,Zero 8i,will infinix also release phone globally no comment because have never used it
Infinix,Zero 8i,using years
Infinix,Zero 8i,shahzaib aug been using this phone for year now it has problem now when ever restart or turn the ph more yes auto on of
Infinix,Zero 8i,redim phone is far better than infnixe phone ok quite good phoneshould be among best phones
Infinix,Zero 8i,you dont have to be torn with this infinix note pro is far more better than this when it comes to the camera dept redmi note pro is better cuz it comes with mp cam while infinix note pro is only mp and thats if it is selected if not it shoots in mp
Infinix,Zero 8i,like camera style
Infinix,Zero 8i,redmi note pro is far better than zero and it is true that zero support and tb more agree but redmi note pros real opponent is the infinix note pro hahaa
Infinix,Zero 8i,any gcam for this device as it support camera api like this phone
Infinix,Zero 8i,no which is better when it comes to camera infinix zero or redmi note pro im torn between the two what about the external memory ive read that it could be extended until with the infinix zero is it true please help me decide which one to buy also heard that xiaomi phones have heating issues
Infinix,Zero 8i,any chance to get any update mine security patch is also from
Infinix,Zero 8i,good one boss like ur analysis novice in this mediatek thing and snapdragon will more think poco can handle your task without breaking sweat
Infinix,Zero 8i,bruh did hear you say miles better it seems youve not done your research prope more boss if your say something blind you should know theorical approach of socs snapdragon or has core architecture of cortex and meditek has cortex cortex is faster than cortex and now you will may be thing that in sd has core higher performance core and has only because has boost in frequency of each core
Infinix,Zero 8i,you all have no idea what you are talking about meadiatek do no come close to qualcomm to be more compare with same segment class soc dont compare snapdragon flagship soc and mediatek mid range one now mediatek is one the leading company in smartphone soc industry past is past dont think that past is same as present present and future may have changes in thinks mediatek latest midrange chips very battery efficiency and powerful than some of snapdragon midrange soc in future they may have flapship processor in dimensity series like in their line up snapdragon is good in one ways maximum smartphone vendors they optimized their androids to snapdragon mediatek is new comer in last year smartphone vendors have to come up with new optimized code for meditek to make their smartphone to perform well in some case without optimization some mediatek soc is performing well compare same segment snapdragon
Infinix,Zero 8i,really loving this
Infinix,Zero 8i,have reported the issue very very very bad experience in with infinix good phone
Infinix,Zero 8i,kinda like the back camera style
Infinix,Zero 8i,erm about that gorilla glass but they didnt get to mention it in the specs it has corning gorilla glass
Infinix,Zero 8i,lol worst phone ever meant inch display cant handle you cant handle inches screen then thats your problem it doesnt make the phone worse simply dont buy it and keep using small screen phones that you can handle
Infinix,Zero 8i,best infinity phone ever
Infinix,Zero 8i,cant imagine using hz refresh rate on nm processor
Infinix,Zero 8i,but the chispet is different you but we can easy
Infinix,Zero 8i,is no where near sd please ill concede that qualcomm has amazing support regarding drivers but the series chips are low to mid so of course any mid tear helio will wipe the floor with them but coming to phones with similar price ranges to the zero or anything above the will compete with the gt head on and actually beat it in terms of the image processor and drivers for hdr etc
Infinix,Zero 8i,yes it does it has gorilla glass lol it is not mentioned anywhere
Infinix,Zero 8i,poco has the ugly notch display with only nits of brightness and only has watt char more is no where near sd please
Infinix,Zero 8i,poco is much betterobviously poco has the ugly notch display with only nits of brightness and only has watt charging doesnt have an ultrawide camera only has gb ram snapdragon is worst than helio then how could it compete with gt
Infinix,Zero 8i,no yes it does it has gorilla glass lol
Infinix,Zero 8i,infinix zero was launched in october in pakistan
Infinix,Zero 8i,samsung ms and better than this phone and much better for pupg yes samsung price also much better more higher maybe double price this phone is perfect only security updates are very important
Infinix,Zero 8i,you cant complain with the size if you say is to big you may too much comfortable with more infinix is coming in hot with this phone its impressive
Infinix,Zero 8i,the price its good the is worst in everything dont know doesnt seem alot to me tbh
Infinix,Zero 8i,hmm my apologies zero is bit overpriced compared to am not fan of miui tho more the price its good the is worst in everything
Infinix,Zero 8i,check the poco for the about the same price before you talk please hmm my apologies zero is bit overpriced compared to am not fan of miui tho xos looks clearer cheers
Infinix,Zero 8i,im saying that there are better chipsets like the series from snapdragon are appearing in more thats not right you wronghelio is good chipset
Infinix,Zero 8i,he is expecting where he is supposed to get only humans demand never end check the poco for the about the same price before you talk please
Infinix,Zero 8i,good price good phone am right
Infinix,Zero 8i,cool feature with sexy look specly stb think price is very good
Infinix,Zero 8i,no dual bandddd poco better
Infinix,Zero 8i,the back is pretty cool actually
Infinix,Zero 8i,the cpu is bit eh for the price what do mean eh its great cipset for the price at this price usually get like or sometimes sd which are trash compared to gt what did expect to be sdg smh
Infinix,Zero Flip,please develop wide screen phone
Infinix,Zero Flip,yes its possible to call and hear person when folded yes and also can support fb and other apps
Infinix,Zero Flip,yes is it possible to make call when its folded does it have two mics and speaker to make call like xiaomi flip like can we hear the person when its folded
Infinix,Zero Flip,is this usb type yes
Infinix,Zero Flip,it has been nearly month and it is fantastic performance is awesome and the looks are crazy especially iphone users says that is genuis solution for new design far better than samsung or motorola flip phones the screen resolution refresh rate much better daily usage one full day time video is good and the pictures are good cover games are so good one thing so sad is have only one cover which is out of the box and can not find online
Infinix,Zero Flip,for nahhh
Infinix,Zero Flip,dont buy infinix phone their software update sucks
Infinix,Zero Flip,infinix itel tecno all are under one company transition you mean transsion not transition just to correct you sir
Infinix,Zero Flip,since foldablescreens break alot how good is infinix support when their software support is this bad guess how their hardware support will be
Infinix,Zero Flip,im assuming that this will end up being rebranded tecno phantom flip infinix itel tecno all are under one company transition
Infinix,Zero Flip,infinix zero flip debuts with dimensity fast charging reverse wired
Infinix,Zero Flip,corning gorilla glass what apparently its victus which makes more sense
Infinix,Zero Flip,yeah it just got announced it is rebranded phantom flip indeed if specs sheet are correct here for both phones infinix have more internal storage and mp selfie camera with video capabilities other than that its basically tecno clone on the bright side all reviews watched confirmed that tecno flip is better than its first generation even using less powerfull chipset
Infinix,Zero Flip,mint sep this and the tecno phantom flip looks almost the exact same and almost has the exact same more yeah it just got announced it is rebranded phantom flip indeed
Infinix,Zero Flip,this and the tecno phantom flip looks almost the exact same and almost has the exact same spec sheet im almost convinced this is rebrand
Infinix,Zero Flip,samsung okay am stop creating flip phonese
Infinix,Zero Flip,its the first infinix flip phoneso expect the phone to not be as great as the other flip phone
Infinix,Zero Flip,whos to say this wouldnt just be straight up phantom flip with infinixs name slapped on it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,enjoyed using this but within year ll be switching this infinix zero ultra to my hua wei ultra which fell in love instantly the moment unbox it and now it is lying in my drawer and iam going to start on an un forget able experience with my huawei ultra just like did with my huawei lite for the past years had wonder ful experience with the infinix zero ultra just like did with my first infinix hot which charges its mah battery from real quick inminutes
Infinix,Zero Ultra,after charging it fully to for around ive decided to charge it to only about only then battery could last me for at least around decade as it will not affect the watt fast charging rarely use this phone but do enjoy using it for round year and now im going to use the pultra as primary phone or might be getting the huawei pultra or even the huawei mate pro this phone will come in handy as it charge real ly fast here is my experience on its charging time and anyone can ask me about it any time minutes while the phone is turned off minutes when its signals turn ed off to less than minutes only at times there was time when turn the phone on with out any signal being turned on and the phone was in standby mode and it could last days and hours with battery remaining of hope these can help someone here it would be better to fully charge this phone as it only takes around minutes in rare cases and up to minutes if were to use phone even for while feel very satisfied and would have used this as my primary phone if only it has an ip ip ip and metres drop resistance but am very happy with it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,sadly none when you buy this phone you just live it there and get used to it this phone was more it did get one from android to android but yeah not lot
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mine hasnt seen an update since november do have any idea why my signals can turn on its own even after turn to airplane mode and it happens every time deactivate my signal infinite times and every day
Infinix,Zero Ultra,if am not wrong the hot was my first phone from infinix with its gigantic mah still back more is very wonderful smartphones
Infinix,Zero Ultra,been looking for sim tray for this model been months now any assistance
Infinix,Zero Ultra,anyone to sell his zero ultra if its clean need it va white one
Infinix,Zero Ultra,android already not yet have not receive any updates since last may
Infinix,Zero Ultra,how many major software updates have your phone received havent been seeing anything on more sadly none when you buy this phone you just live it there and get used to it this phone was abandoned already for updates using this fone for years because love it but now get used to it and dont expect anymore updates because certainly infinix company just created models without future updates what is out of the box just live it there they will again create new models with android or without future updates so that we buyers will continue buy their new models just think so
Infinix,Zero Ultra,been using my infnx ultra for more than year now and im telling you stopped doing window more how many major software updates have your phone received havent been seeing anything on that yet
Infinix,Zero Ultra,is infinix zero ultra good for heavyduty games such as mobile legends and call of duty youre able to get high framerate and ultra graphics in mlbb in codm there will be high graphics option and max framrate if you enable max framerate the game will only allow you to use low graphics
Infinix,Zero Ultra,this phone good bought it half the original price goes hard fr how much was the initial price in your country mind telling me as im curious to know about it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,never had an issue that required me to use the warranty with these type of phones but would more have the infinix zero ultra which has watt charging speed but have never turned it on but still charges from in about mins do know at what watt is charging cap ped at im planning to buy another infinix but would rather choose another infinix zero ultra if its price reduces and so which is better phone is it the infinix zero or the infinix note
Infinix,Zero Ultra,am hoping for qhd display or no need sorry infinix bye bye
Infinix,Zero Ultra,expected better than this in what way are you not satisfied with this nearly years old phone
Infinix,Zero Ultra,question if buying phones from overseas like infinix how about the warranty and parts replace more good
Infinix,Zero Ultra,well ton more bought two the genesis noir version cost me the equivalent of usd wh more question if buying phones from overseas like infinix how about the warranty and parts replacement if anything goes wrong cant find an answer elsewhere in the net
Infinix,Zero Ultra,can find one for euros and so how much did buy ur infinix zero ultra then well ton more bought two the genesis noir version cost me the equivalent of usd while the coslight silver cost me the equivalent of usd they were that expensive for me because infinix doesnt yet officially sell their phones in my country so the only place selling it can just price it as high as they want to either way enjoy using the zero ultra and eur is an amazing price for it but my suggestion would be to try and get the genesis noir version
Infinix,Zero Ultra,which battery can last longer is it the real me gt neo with its mah or is more have been using this phone for weeks now and it is still good maybe otherwise but it keeps on changing charging periods at first it was minutes to get full now for week had been taking minutes to get full its camera is the better one enjoy my phone fully
Infinix,Zero Ultra,its unique allrounder beast so think it still worths buying can find one for euros and so how much did buy ur infinix zero ultra then
Infinix,Zero Ultra,if were to buy the realme gt neo it wo nt have any advantages compared to the phone which more its unique allrounder beast so think it still worths buying
Infinix,Zero Ultra,digital wellbeing is what check but do use hz so this phone is an easy maybe even more if were to buy the realme gt neo it wo nt have any advantages compared to the phone which going to be released in yrs time as todays phones already have ram rom which only leaves to the chilset as for the infinix zeroultra it might still have some advantages like the watt thunder charge as phone that will be release in years time will most likely dont have watt and perhaps the cameras will still differ from most existing phones
Infinix,Zero Ultra,have got any way for measuring its battery endurance rating wont be using its hz more digital wellbeing is what check but do use hz so this phone is an easy maybe even day phone with hz you are very welcome btw
Infinix,Zero Ultra,can any body here help me do quick comparison between realme gt neo pro infinix ze more which battery can last longer is it the real me gt neo with its mah or is it the infinix zero ultra with its mah sadly dont know how long the gt neo lasts but the zero ultra can last about hours with max everything turned on so id say thats pretty good
Infinix,Zero Ultra,depending on what your needs are the gt neo has better chipset but the zero ultra charges more can any body here help me do quick comparison between realme gt neo pro infinix zeroultra the infinix zeroultra ram rom costs euros while the realme gt neo ram rom costs euros man the realme pro ram rom which costs euros the zero ultra is now only for euros for the black noir and well what do think of it how much is it sold over there in ur country and another question is that and will it explode the next time its battery degrades changed can the be turned off becuase do not see need in activat ing it so as to reduce battery consumption and has it got ram will the addition al gb virtual ram speed up everything and will it be visible afterall and so can the video be zoom ed and if it can what is the maximum zoom can it make up to which battery can last longer is it the real me gt neo with its mah or is it the infinix zero ultra with its mah have read many good comments on the snap dragon so just how good is it dont play any games at all nor do play social medias though
Infinix,Zero Ultra,the realme gt neo is euros with ram rom so which one is better is it gt neo more depending on what your needs are the gt neo has better chipset but the zero ultra charges faster and has much more capable camera setup
Infinix,Zero Ultra,hey may ask which one better this zero ultra or zero in my country zero ultra more which one better this zero ultra or zero thats actually an easier question to answer than you probably thought because have both of those phones and while the zero technically has faster chipset and has an ip rating while the zero ultra has no ip rating still like the zero ultra more lot more dont feel the difference in speed the cameras are better on the ultra it charges lot faster and its still rain resistant even without an ip rating which one better mah or mah the zero ultra it charges lot faster and it actually lasts noticeably longer even with smaller battery but im affraid if infinix will not give update major android well this phone launched with android now it has android with the november security patch and heard it will also receive android but cant guarantee the latter yet unfortunatelly since month after using that phone still no major update thats very sad im sorry that happened to you but still envy you for having the note vip as always wanted that phone but never had chance
Infinix,Zero Ultra,would you say infinix zero ultra is still worth it to buy depends on how much more hey may ask which one better this zero ultra or zero in my country zero ultra was cheaper than zero btw im interested in charging in zero ultra which one better mah or mah but im affraid if infinix will not give update major android previously used infinix note vip since month after using that phone still no major update
Infinix,Zero Ultra,deleted post the zero ultra was and is still available in my country located in europe whereas the realme gt or the neo or even the gt were never available here might be annoying but at least do my research before commenting to make sure that what im saying is true
Infinix,Zero Ultra,deleted post they didnt took anything away the zero ultra came out months before that prototype device with and said charging speed might still show up in an upcoming infinix phone but it has never been available just yet the actual zero ultra with charging came out in october the modified version of it with which was just prototype came out in march and was never available as it was just prototype the realme gt rebranded gt neo is more expensive than the zero ultra and is available in even less markets than said infinix device
Infinix,Zero Ultra,so which phone has someone selling infinix zero ultra with but want same as gu more as said it before that was prototype device some reviewers got their hands on it but its not available for consumers realme gt neo has the highest watt charger of all commercially available phones but it only charges minutes faster than the zero ultra with only slightly bigger battery mah vs mah so dont think its worth it but that phone does have much better chipset
Infinix,Zero Ultra,no that was modified zero ultra prototype it doesnt really matter minutes for more so which phone has someone selling infinix zero ultra with but want same as guy in video how come ha has both chargers and want both chargers where to buy them httpswwwebaycoukitmhashitemdffegyvkaaoswtljowhamdataencaaqaiaaaaiojnzyhbcehrdbhvaftocfkhpfyyujfxebwricrcrbpnvfafopaqqphuefqkkoyjreikfkezxuorbaxcmlfpjdsegrmlakrcyujcoaseuzyjiivbttmwuyilxuobtfrbwflufoylnrxkacvuojmxyqyvmbsqrvcjrbklvfpqdfobucqxvfliicsgqsffnvtbikztnupmvpxnfghigglfzytosydykwxwbvfqcahxllghdbtaszzwrzeicexrctkpabfbmswfj
Infinix,Zero Ultra,but this phone should come with charger httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwifdmibek no that was modified zero ultra prototype it doesnt really matter minutes for full charge is just perfect
Infinix,Zero Ultra,who said you needed to trade for for that you very much implied that otherwise why attack me over recommending this phone its great phone and for about eur usd its really really great phone
Infinix,Zero Ultra,okay and are you the one using the phone and very much enjoying it or is it me more who said you needed to trade for for that
Infinix,Zero Ultra,yeah sure with year of software updates left okay and are you the one using the phone and very much enjoying it or is it me im sorry for not trading my gan came in the box btw for added value charging for guess battery life has remained the same as it was when the phone was brand new which was almost year ago no visible degradation at all
Infinix,Zero Ultra,it doesnt cost anywhere near that anymore its at maximum half that yeah sure with year of software updates left
Infinix,Zero Ultra,at euro eh no it doesnt cost anywhere near that anymore its at maximum half that
Infinix,Zero Ultra,also can pls do quick math on the phones screen to body ratio of the phone for me man dont really have any good ways to truly measure that but id say its about maybe because of that agressive curvature but its very bright and extremely nice display can totally recommend this phone
Infinix,Zero Ultra,so its around euros for the black noir so is it still worth buy too dude quo more also can pls do quick math on the phones screen to body ratio of the phone for me man
Infinix,Zero Ultra,november security patch on deck
Infinix,Zero Ultra,so its around euros for the black noir so is it still worth buy too dude is it more so its around euros for the black noir so is it still worth buy too dude absolutely for that much money its steal is it really minutes to fully charge from have ever timed it before its closer to minutes most of the time but it can do it in minutes as well yes
Infinix,Zero Ultra,nice phone it improves the game experience and tried to play roblox there is no lag and cra more no sd card
Infinix,Zero Ultra,already bought of this of each color wonder why such great phone stop looking at more so its around euros for the black noir so is it still worth buy too dude is it really minutes to fully charge from have ever timed it before
Infinix,Zero Ultra,how was playing for pubg
Infinix,Zero Ultra,hello are you noticed this issue on your zero ultra when the phones screen is set more just checked it today but no didnt notice any changes in brightness tried it on max and half brightness but it looks the same to me on both hz and hz have you updated it android
Infinix,Zero Ultra,android has finally arrived alongside with the july security patch the phone is much impr more how do update to ios please
Infinix,Zero Ultra,would you say infinix zero ultra is still worth it to buy and also whats your main phon more would you say infinix zero ultra is still worth it to buy depends on how much you can get it for in my country its the equivalent of usd for the coslight silver model and usd for the genesis noir version they have the exact same specs and amount of ram and storage so dont know why there is such large price difference between them anyways for about usd or less id say its worth it if its more expensive then id say no and also whats your main phone right now and how much is it my current main is the vivo note and has been for over months find it hard to switch to any of my other phones now that own this and its because of the size difference yeah the zero ultra is quite big and was actually the phone that made me buy the note but the vivo is so much wider that every other phone just feels small compared to it have the gbgb variant in vegan leather blue that currently costs shipping is about usd from tradingshenzen which is where got mine from
Infinix,Zero Ultra,minutes charge is excellent
Infinix,Zero Ultra,whats camera sensor this from samsung or omnivision the spec doesnt mention anyt more its samsung isocell hp the optical format is
Infinix,Zero Ultra,that chipset is whack dimensity no gorilla glass for fon worth give it wide ber more listen to darling yext where did you get all those ideas from
Infinix,Zero Ultra,any news regarding the android update its quite disappointing that infinix seems to more unfortunatelly just checked my zero ultra an hour ago and its still only android with the april security patch oh well
Infinix,Zero Ultra,yeah can honestly say its very good device in all aspects although its processor more it sure does yeah the chipset isnt flagship one but aside from hardcore gaming it is fast and very smooth display is gorgeous too
Infinix,Zero Ultra,oh youve got zero ultra as well thats cool man yeah can honestly say its very good device in all aspects although its processor may not be the most powerful it still works perfectly without any problems this device marks infinixs entry into the realm of flagship killers
Infinix,Zero Ultra,thanks for your reply am still under april security patch based on android hopefully th more oh youve got zero ultra as well thats cool man
Infinix,Zero Ultra,no infinix promised android but they didnt talk about not giving the zero ultra and more thanks for your reply am still under april security patch based on android hopefully they will release the soon be safe
Infinix,Zero Ultra,no problem at all take your time to check if your zero ultra has received the android upda more no infinix promised android but they didnt talk about not giving the zero ultra android nor did they promise that it will get that too
Infinix,Zero Ultra,so heres my theory so the infinix zero pro or something like that had soc but the more think they did as well but there is nothing inside the phone in the settings app or anywhere that would confirm it takes pretty good pictures tho so wouldnt really care about the native mp support
Infinix,Zero Ultra,how to support infinix zero ultra mp mediatek dimensity sos dont support more so heres my theory so the infinix zero pro or something like that had soc but the doesnt support hz so infinix said they added another soc that supports hz so in theory infinix added another soc to support mp its just theory tech theory
Infinix,Zero Ultra,sure have already seen what infinixs website says about the coslight silver model more sorry for the argument just wanted becareful of the phone and youd better not drop it lol
Infinix,Zero Ultra,nope its tempered glass both front and back thought have the phone how can no more have the phone in both color variants coslight silver is very clearly plastic whereas the genesis noir version is glass which one do you have
Infinix,Zero Ultra,what ufs storage are they using its
Infinix,Zero Ultra,thats only like correct but yea the genesis noir version is glass on the back the more nope its tempered glass both front and back thought have the phone how can not tell glass from plastic try scratching it and see
Infinix,Zero Ultra,nope its plastic but ive read some reviews and they all praise the build quality sayi more the genesis noir version is glass but both versions feel very premium given that they are very heavy but in good way
Infinix,Zero Ultra,rahim dec it is not plastic phone it has glass back and polished aluminium frame then curved more thats only like correct but yea the genesis noir version is glass on the back the coslight silver version is plastic tho and the sides are also plastic for both models
Infinix,Zero Ultra,love how instead of admitting you were wrong you just kept saying glass like child when more he was technically correct the genesis noir version is glass the coslight silver version however is plastic both of them have plastic sides
Infinix,Zero Ultra,the soc dosent even support mp brothey couldve put mp camera and make the more there is absolutely nothing wrong with the soc its plenty fast even for gaming agree tho the mp camera is kind of gimmick but only the resolution of it the size of it helps lot with night photography
Infinix,Zero Ultra,welp so the mp its clearly just to attract customers gimmick not at all own this phone and takes amazing pictures especially at night because of that huge sensor the megapixels of it may not be officially supported but sheer size of the image sensor is taken advantage of you can still take mp shots it just takes longer to process but the pictures will come out with way more detail
Infinix,Zero Ultra,they didnt dimensity doesnt support fps only fps it also doesn more welp so the mp its clearly just to attract customers gimmick
Infinix,Zero Ultra,ek mar thats because they lied they didnt dimensity doesnt support fps only fps it also doesnt support mp cameras only mp aside from that the sensor is still mp
Infinix,Zero Ultra,does this work on the united states metropcs
Infinix,Zero Ultra,lol imagine paying for phone with dimensity they couldve removed the curved more already bought of this of each color wonder why such great phone stop looking at nothing but the specs and the numbers there are many rare features on this phone even at that price yes you can get more powerful phones than this at this price but then you will have to sacrifice some things that this has for example stunning cameras huge main sensor really helps brighten up the night shot mp ultrawide is huge upgrade over the usual mp and it has af as well meaning it can do macro but actually good macro gaming is perfectly fine as well but if you only game on your phone then of course look elsewhere but this isnt gaming phone this is more of complete package
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mm oct they should have put jack rather than the sd no mm is less useful than microsd
Infinix,Zero Ultra,curved screen mono speaker ugh nvm it has dual speakers
Infinix,Zero Ultra,hey gsmarena mods highlander or someone this phone has stereo speakers and nfc and does not have micro sd slot just thought of sharing these since own this phone
Infinix,Zero Ultra,dont deserve this price it very expensive can purchase nova by this price and it bett more how is the nova better this has bigger and higher resolution main camera with ois nova has no ois bigger and higher resolution ultrawide camera with af nova has no af bigger battery with much faster charging zero ultra has google play services the nova doesnt zero has and the nova doesnt zero ultra also has much bigger display and is overall the way better phone in every spec possible
Infinix,Zero Ultra,why doesnt have audio jack mm not sure but it does come with an adapter
Infinix,Zero Ultra,does it truly have under display fingerprint yes and it is very fast
Infinix,Zero Ultra,you dont need to prove anything at all let these brochure readers comment as they like in th more or simply just be happy with what you have so much better than pumping cash to brands and making cheesy excuses to protect the environment
Infinix,Zero Ultra,specs seems enticing how long is the after sale support and update thanks for answering most likely not very long but have received one security update on it within month of usage
Infinix,Zero Ultra,hi there hope somebody could help me by giving me sound advise here please ive foreve more done the testing and its perfect for it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,oh man just got my first oppo phone which is my first sd phone and wow its so muc more enjoy
Infinix,Zero Ultra,its not better sd is faster in cpu and gpu anything which rely on those things sd wi more oh man just got my first oppo phone which is my first sd phone and wow its so much faster than anything ive used before
Infinix,Zero Ultra,nice and im already on the find gotta say color os is surely something else
Infinix,Zero Ultra,yeah really like this phone as well just get bored easily thats why buy so many more nice
Infinix,Zero Ultra,hey was considering that phone too when was shopping around but its so exceedingly rare more yeah really like this phone as well just get bored easily thats why buy so many phones lol
Infinix,Zero Ultra,do thanks but ill actually switch tomorrow going to get an oppo find hey was considering that phone too when was shopping around but its so exceedingly rare in my country that the only ones found are full on chinese versions ultimately settle with this instead because really like the idea of charging the phone in just minutes zero ultra delivered just as advertised on that regard
Infinix,Zero Ultra,in regular daily activities is better if you want to stress your phone out and play heav more you dont need to prove anything at all let these brochure readers comment as they like in their minds bigger number is simply better and it doesnt make sense to buy anything else inferior enjoy the phone that you have right now let them enjoy the better phone they dream of buying but never bought after all better phone will come next month its better to dream of that one instead
Infinix,Zero Ultra,well that would make sense but if thats true then the zero ultra with is better more its not better sd is faster in cpu and gpu anything which rely on those things sd will perform better because you dont stress your cpu or gpu doesnt mean is better
Infinix,Zero Ultra,yest storage is one which made apps open faster or slower with ssd will open app faster th more well that would make sense but if thats true then the zero ultra with is better than sd phones because its newer than every phone that would be using sd not that this makes any sense given that my iqoo pro is much better phone and is about years old also yes know storage type can make phone faster but this infinix surely doesnt have ufs or while the op pro has ufs which means that they are either identical or the zero ultra is worse yet its still faster
Infinix,Zero Ultra,storage type huh oneplus pro has ufs im not sure about the infinix think it more yest storage is one which made apps open faster or slower with ssd will open app faster than with hdd thats basic knowledge of computers also it can be because your infinix is new and oneplus is old thats why one feels faster than another and ufs is only for flagship as of now
Infinix,Zero Ultra,then dont mislead that is better than sd because its not true opening app faster is more storage type huh oneplus pro has ufs im not sure about the infinix think its also ufs but for sure not or so they are the same in the regards if anything the infinix would be the worse oh and dont mention storage size either both of them are gb
Infinix,Zero Ultra,faster on what exactly try to run heavy games like genshini impact to stress those soc and yo more im sorry but thats not my daily routine it is faster at opening every app and just you know running them and it is definitely more fluid probably mostly due to hz vs hz but still it doesnt matter if the op pro can run genshin better people who wanna run heavy games obviusly arent gonna buy phone with its perfect for bloons td battles and thats all play on it for genshin got my razer phone with hz and huge stereo speakers
Infinix,Zero Ultra,look have oneplus pro with the sd yet the infinix is faster my iqoo pro with more faster on what exactly try to run heavy games like genshini impact to stress those soc and you will know which one is powerfull
Infinix,Zero Ultra,gt just typo there oh yeah that is obviusly better buy
Infinix,Zero Ultra,also is worse than sd how can it perform like sd it slower than sd look have oneplus pro with the sd yet the infinix is faster my iqoo pro with sd on the other hand is significantly faster than the zero ultra so id say its somewhere between the sd and the sd on the other hand is better than both sd and sd would definitely perform better in phones other than the oneplus pro with android so thats why im saying its only better than the sd but worse than the
Infinix,Zero Ultra,you can get gb variant for less price while you get better soc sd better display be more durability seems solid on this phone also the back is glass well half of it is but not on the coslight silver model httpsyoutubeqlokuivmsyc
Infinix,Zero Ultra,that phone is expensive in india what do you expect check jumia you can see price here in afr more there is no such thing as just pro which is even more of midrange phone than this there is also an gt for ft which is definitely much better deal for people who only care about performance and durability curved screens are for sure less durable for me the camera charging speed and having an oled screen was much more important especially because the dimensity already performs just like an sd which is more than enough to be fair none of this means that the zero ultra is great value as for software updates ive finally received the first one some bug fixes and the november security update is all it was so it is is behind for sure
Infinix,Zero Ultra,ive never heard it go up to that much anywhere but in hungary and here everything is more that phone is expensive in india what do you expect check jumia you can see price here in africa its priced as highend while offer midrange specs checked emag highend phones like poco cost ft which is around euro with you can get many flagship killer even cheap flagship like oneplus saw it for euro
Infinix,Zero Ultra,yah because need to touch device to know paying to buy device is madness so what would you recommend around usd tell me so can tell you how much it would cost here
Infinix,Zero Ultra,you talk like you own this device when im sure you never even held it in store yah because need to touch device to know paying to buy device is madness
Infinix,Zero Ultra,where are getting your prices from own the device and accounting for currency conversions more also own this device and absolutely love it price is different in every country tho and mean very different in my country it costs the equivalent of usd but bought it when it was on sale for the equivalent of usd which is still almost double of what youve payed for it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,no memory sim card can add information not correct in this site found this after bought more you right and its right here there also more site incorection on site that not nice thing know but here price about eur disclaimer we can not guarantee that the information on this page is correct read
Infinix,Zero Ultra,glass glass glass love how instead of admitting you were wrong you just kept saying glass like child when theyre losing an argument must be kick in the teeth to realize you have the mentality of yearold
Infinix,Zero Ultra,as doesnt have dedicated sd card slot doesnt have fm radio it has the worst in more there are sd card slot in as lol
Infinix,Zero Ultra,as cost half or of that price while offering superior specs its great if you can get it at that price the base model costs around here
Infinix,Zero Ultra,people are slowly getting into cruve display fetishes
Infinix,Zero Ultra,plastic phone cant feel premium this phone can feel premium cause of curved screen and more it feels more premium than samsung
Infinix,Zero Ultra,with price tag this smartphone is trash price too high redmi note pro slitly better more dont think they are in the same category as samsung especially in price similar spec samsung would cost more than double now compared to the redmi pro the wireless charging wins me over but you almost had me leaning redmi give me the pro with wireless and it will be interesting
Infinix,Zero Ultra,uh it does have video dont know what ur talking about its just good marketing
Infinix,Zero Ultra,the performance that you get for the price is also not worth it just got this phone yesterday and it is totally worth it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,this smartphone camera is bit funny the dimensity chipset only supports camera with resolution of megapixels but infinix instead uses resolution of megapixels
Infinix,Zero Ultra,ironic how it sells itself as having mp camera and doesnt even have video uh it does have video dont know what ur talking about
Infinix,Zero Ultra,infinix should launch this in indian online marketprobabely they are experimenting with the durability in smaller markets
Infinix,Zero Ultra,this is very intresting and high specification mobile phoneits camera is superb am really like it and want to buy this mobile phonethis is perfect to mebut have no money to purchase it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,its available in my country thank you cilde can ask what county do you live in and do you know of any online retailers that are selling it ive been watching qatar and philippines due to contacts that can forward it to me
Infinix,Zero Ultra,it is listed as available but that doesnt seem to be the case ive been trying to more its available in my country
Infinix,Zero Ultra,nice looking so beautiful phones
Infinix,Zero Ultra,infinix zero ultra is cheaper with high specs compared to iphone pro max actually will not compare this phone with flagship like iphone yes iphone is more and too expensive but the software tuning and branding image on iphone does not make fanboy or executive move to infinix from apple thhe specs maybe great for the price but mp camera tuning in infinix does not really impress for flagship class or even mid high class yeah back again for the cheaper price there must be some cut off including the software development which is only standard develop rather than premium flagship develop
Infinix,Zero Ultra,which brand infinix or tecno is more stable in terms of their system ui infinix zero ultra is cheaper with high specs compared to iphone pro max
Infinix,Zero Ultra,wow so awesome but whats the price around
Infinix,Zero Ultra,you compared to infinix the price alone is much different wow so awesome but whats the price
Infinix,Zero Ultra,this is more expensive than poco gt lol really like this phone
Infinix,Zero Ultra,even my lg with mp sensor can record at jajajajajja you compared to infinix the price alone is much different
Infinix,Zero Ultra,this garbage puts high number hardware that you can brag about but not use and holy flying more
Infinix,Zero Ultra,beauty from outside and garbage ui selling at are yall joking the new redmi se more but this are international version not cn version
Infinix,Zero Ultra,is true use dedicated slot sd card cant see in youtube review
Infinix,Zero Ultra,oct dimensity is such letdown well it is and it isnt they had to keep the price below certain level and the dimensity is new enough they could have done the snapdragon but its too old
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mediatek also from tsmc taiwan and with nm meaning advanced chipset using euv lithography machine
Infinix,Zero Ultra,dimensity is such letdown
Infinix,Zero Ultra,we are waiting for it review we
Infinix,Zero Ultra,know mp and fast charging feels cool but the downside if these phone is the chips more the phone is awesome but my only problem is there is no gorilla glass protection and not drop resistant and for such high price in the african markets mean who are they fooling with that pre installed screen protector how will that save the screen from getting broken when it falls
Infinix,Zero Ultra,imagine paying for phone with dimensity horrendous absolutely horrendous for the price of you can almost buy galaxy plus and second hand pro max but that price point isnt going anywhere it might be cheaper in other markets
Infinix,Zero Ultra,those this device have nfc most sites have checked says it doesnt and its called flagship device total rubbish no nfc no gorilla glass protection very annoying
Infinix,Zero Ultra,is this fone comes with dts sound it uses dts
Infinix,Zero Ultra,is there really dedicated microsd expansion slot some reviews indicate theres nonewhile some reviews says there is
Infinix,Zero Ultra,finally dimensity on infinix phones just need mm jack though
Infinix,Zero Ultra,the infinix company must be cracking childs joke how could one produce mp camera video this is childs play
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mp but still no kfps this company is joke its because they use pathetic chipset
Infinix,Zero Ultra,they are selling it ghc in my country which is equivalent to almost dollars with that price you can get samsung galaxy ultra which is far far far better than this phone
Infinix,Zero Ultra,dimensity max camera isp is mpis tht gimmick
Infinix,Zero Ultra,nothing is special about xiaomi pro but the wide camera which zero ultra has same th more is this fone comes with dts sound
Infinix,Zero Ultra,why the does it say dual sim nanosim dual standby when it only have sim slot and more sdcard slot at the back of those sim trays
Infinix,Zero Ultra,dude ur seriously comparing this phone to tpro mean on paper the tpro sounds bad on real more nothing is special about xiaomi pro but the wide camera which zero ultra has same the difference is ultrawide camera zero ultra is better with ultrawide with af as regards to camera infinix may not have years of os updates but its good for the money
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mp sensor absolutely shame and insult these days chipset and mah battery is no justice with the phone at dollars
Infinix,Zero Ultra,what about lg that product always first about screens
Infinix,Zero Ultra,how many years os your consumers are most likely in africa the price is not going to work more would rather not have updates than to have them bad as bbks are realme oneplus just give me security updates and do not bother me with major andorid version update if you are going to make bad update
Infinix,Zero Ultra,the phone lists for on aliexpress with the dimensity no thank you
Infinix,Zero Ultra,how comes with mp infinix we are wise now cant carry mp
Infinix,Zero Ultra,no its from huawei first phone with curved display was the galaxy note edge and the second was the galaxy edge third was the blackberry priv so nope it definitely isnt from huawei
Infinix,Zero Ultra,whats next helio with camera hz refresh rate with no sim card tray nor headphones jack bruh
Infinix,Zero Ultra,first off the names wack asf second the spec is wack asf third generally the phone more no its from huawei
Infinix,Zero Ultra,price is too much high as compare to infinix past price trend for all devices also screen looks clone of outdated samsung note series the only good thing is fastest charging think due to higher price this device may not capture much attention as other infinix devices usually do due to competitive prices infinix should reconsider the offered price for zero ultra
Infinix,Zero Ultra,am reconfused some site it doesnt have dedidated micro sd slot and here it does have micro sd slot so which is true
Infinix,Zero Ultra,you guys havent even seen the phone yet you are just reading the specs and you talking yeah about most of you guys saying all this mean comments are probably still using years old phone right now for me was extremely impressed when saw this phone especially with the inch amoled display its very rare before you see phone with that screen size just wish the company would do the same with tecno device
Infinix,Zero Ultra,no way this phone beats everyone in this category xiaomi pro has ultrawide without af more you do realize the price aint even out yet how do you even compare this to anyone in the competition if you dont know how much this will cost also infinix has the record of upscaling photos infinix note and note both has camera specs being overexaggerated my mp huawei phone takes better photos in this mp infinix provides oh also screen color is too way off the scales even for an amoled panel
Infinix,Zero Ultra,infinix good job fenix
Infinix,Zero Ultra,camera setup of this is better than mi pro this have same mp ois main sensor but this more because they always counting corners and disrespecting their customers these areas are the points apple holding on to all times for customers experience
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mp good luck storage xd
Infinix,Zero Ultra,having qsd or dimensity would definitely bump up the price by lot possibly around to so think aint that bat at all to be honest it should at leaat be idk they picked when is literally there but like said better soc more expensive and to keep it affordable dont think they would go for higher priced soc for the meantime
Infinix,Zero Ultra,they couldve just use some greater chipset like dimensity or sd it is called penetrating the market and knowing your customers dont have to teach you this stuff
Infinix,Zero Ultra,curved display if not definitely buy
Infinix,Zero Ultra,how do they manage to have the support the mp hp sensor as the chipset supports more think the phone only captures mp and infinix advertise it to have mp idk if am correct not am just telling
Infinix,Zero Ultra,why no stereo speaker it has stereo speakers mate
Infinix,Zero Ultra,why not consider usb
Infinix,Zero Ultra,charging speed
Infinix,Zero Ultra,pretty interesting phone will definitely check out the review
Infinix,Zero Ultra,unfortunately all infinix phones suffer from that uncalibrated screen colors its so unnatural to look at and all pictures taken will look different in calibrated screen every single color is waaaay off in infinix
Infinix,Zero Ultra,coming from samsung hp is it good
Infinix,Zero Ultra,yes no mm jack but inside the box youll get usbc wired earphones and an usbc to more it has micro sd slot
Infinix,Zero Ultra,they should have put jack rather than the sd
Infinix,Zero Ultra,nice and good but heard they ditched the mm jack how do you apply screen gu more yes no mm jack but inside the box youll get usbc wired earphones and an usbc to mm adapter another thing discovered by watching reviews was that they also took away the microsd slot
Infinix,Zero Ultra,finally infinix produced device worth buying but then still garbage ui and they ditched the audio jack porti cant believe it
Infinix,Zero Ultra,cool phone
Infinix,Zero Ultra,too pricey for now but might be an excellent choice after some months or during aliexpress
Infinix,Zero Ultra,no nfc its not known yet
Infinix,Zero Ultra,get the pricing right and itll sell like cake
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mono speakerv
Infinix,Zero Ultra,am happy to see them advancing to superior quality products
Infinix,Zero Ultra,mp and fast charge this phone will be priceperformance monster

Infinix,Zero X Neo,battery life is too much low
Infinix,Zero X Neo,please launch the same phone with smaller size like inch or inches mediatek processor in india around to
Infinix,Zero X Neo,im using worth it like it sounds is just right too loud when quiet place
Infinix,Zero X Neo,it also supports fps vedio recording but it has stereo speakers
Infinix,Zero X Neo,overall best value for money only issue takes approx hours to charge man the phone takes like an hour have the xiaomi redmi note pro and it has the same charging power and mah battery and my phone charges in no time so there is problem in your wall plug
Infinix,Zero X Neo,guys did got xos update in this phone yes am currently using it and it has xos
Infinix,Zero X Neo,upgrade camera issue
Infinix,Zero X Neo,bought this phone it has ois which is definitely better than eis camera is good too but if more isnt ois only on the periscope camera there is no ois on the main camera which iwe often use for photo and video
Infinix,Zero X Neo,where the fingerprint of this phone its builtin on power button at right side
Infinix,Zero X Neo,you can use too but the phone only use wso it doesnt matter what charger you use at all the charger brick comes with it is watts but have seen in youtube review that if you use infinix watts charger then its charging speed increases lot so this phone does support charing at faster rate than watts make sure you only use infinix charger of higher wattage if you wish to charge it faster
Infinix,Zero X Neo,best in this category have been using since month and it has produced impressive results till now
Infinix,Zero X Neo,no non of themit even doesnt have gorilla glass too it use corning gorilla glass
Infinix,Zero X Neo,techno didnt released phone here so have no idea about that but in this price tag this phone more yes its ips htz display can buy its pro model if like amoled display infinix zero has launched models zero neo this one zero pro
Infinix,Zero X Neo,hi babak this phone camera is best from tecno camon pro techno didnt released phone here so have no idea about that but in this price tag this phone is not bad the only problem is that think its not an amoled screen as the colors accuracy looks like lcd screen
Infinix,Zero X Neo,deleted post sorry but cant understand what you mean can you please describe better
Infinix,Zero X Neo,how much time do you charge this to own zero charge my phone once every day dont play games on it but im in social media alot and use
Infinix,Zero X Neo,this is first low price phone with periscope camera
Infinix,Zero X Neo,can ghz processor enough for normal use
Infinix,Zero X Neo,is there periscope camera phone under dollars
Infinix,Zero X Neo,why infinix doesnt build good phones why their ui is so boring we need stock android more xos is one of the best ui in the world it has everything you need
Infinix,Zero X Neo,can its have camera video
Infinix,Zero X Neo,is this best phone from other infinix mob
Infinix,Zero X Neo,wth the phone cost around in my country bruh its so cheap
Infinix,Zero X Neo,body materials is it plasticglassceramics or aluminium not that much impressed
Infinix,Zero X Neo,goof phone just the ultrawide camera is not good hope more makers realize soon that better ultrawide is doing the trick great that there is no and no underscreen fingerprint am avoiding this at all cost
Infinix,Zero X Neo,the price will determine
Infinix,Zero X Neo,infinix shouldve just ditch the zoom camera for an ultrawide
Infinix,Zero X Neo,guess that mpx optical zoom costs more then its cpu
Infinix,Zero X Neo,no ac wifi
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix only gives about year of android updates thats true but saying it never had andro more is there an android update for the zero pro havent gotten it even after trying so many times for the system update
Infinix,Zero X Pro,its and still no android updates forget about android infinix is more infinix only gives about year of android updates thats true but saying it never had android thats just wrong the zero pro did get android just dont expect anything after that its midrange phone with only one year its not like its just update like samsung literally every other midrange phone update like year back in the
Infinix,Zero X Pro,my infinix zero pro kind of review in and my frustrating issues with it so far more wow thats weird my zero pro is running fine never had any other weird issues with random resets and stuff like that after the steps shared here also never had the need to factory reset my phone because of this random restarts after installing apps or updates when it received updates but it seems that you will need to do it wish could help you more but dont know much more how to fix those issues
Infinix,Zero X Pro,so not even in under month since posted this the restarting problem got worse it not onl more factory reset the phone immediately update to latest os patch once its turn on might take few update till you reach the latest the original os version it comes with is very buggy and unstable
Infinix,Zero X Pro,bought new it at rm last month okay years old fon for the price got the tuscany brown more buy on sell in at direct for rm now its just as backup phone bcoz already buy pixel pro by the way are mine only or other user fingerprint always not responsive
Infinix,Zero X Pro,helio had mediocre gpu good for fps games such as codm pubgm freefire just heating issues if you play too long
Infinix,Zero X Pro,why isnt there new system
Infinix,Zero X Pro,until now im using this unit zero pro until now now very same performance unlike my flagship sd dual chip istill good
Infinix,Zero X Pro,the main camera ois does not work the telephoto camera ois does better if there any update ti fix this
Infinix,Zero X Pro,zero pro mid range killer perfect phone using since one and half yearno hanging no heat issuecamera is top notchpro level phone in budget
Infinix,Zero X Pro,you said you had the tuscany brown version does it really use faux leathervegan on the back more no missed the brown which got sold out so only got the silver one after it restocked later on which is still nice though color has some gradient depending on where you look at it altho its probably doesnt really matter anyway because im using the case that included in the box
Infinix,Zero X Pro,actually missed the rm once before it had brown in stock but took too much time rese more you said you had the tuscany brown version does it really use faux leathervegan on the back instead of glass im curious to know if its at least resistant to water and stains because infinix stores on aliexpress started to sell this version again and yes infinix should rerelease this phone with conectivity usually am strongly against this rerelease thing but have phones in my mind that should be rereleased with modern specs and zero pro is one of these phones even at its normal price it has all the features and specs necessary for wellround performance nice build made of glass excellent set of cameras without those useless mp or ai sensors video both on selfie main and telephoto cameras good battery fast charging hz refresh rate headphone jack and even microsd slot can only imagine how good it would be using dimensity or dimensity
Infinix,Zero X Pro,rm thats dollars what bargain would have bought for that price more actually missed the rm once before it had brown in stock but took too much time researching why they sell this phone cheaper than the other shop kinda regretted it when saw it sold out so started to check out the other phone but luckily after few days scrolled shopee at dawn saw it in stock again unit silver been using zero pro for weeks its good phone wish infinix releases version of this kind of phone too probably call it zero pro iig or something
Infinix,Zero X Pro,need android version why infinix to stuck his version its capable this version hope infinix give me your answer
Infinix,Zero X Pro,not even one android version update why is more than capable to run or lol
Infinix,Zero X Pro,my honest opinion go for it and get one think that this phone offers lot even in its more just bought mine with tuscanny brown color the color and touch on the feels quite premium because the of the back glass the camera design have the same design with xiaomi and it is still look awesome
Infinix,Zero X Pro,buy realme pro for allround performance why you want to compare this phone to realme realme doesnt give video recording on back and front camera yes the android version on this is older but trust me this phone will works great for another years
Infinix,Zero X Pro,new security patch august dropped today no issues or bugs so far didnt noticed anything new and the update file was pretty small mb more or less
Infinix,Zero X Pro,was planning to buy this model you think it still worth it or not cause my recent phone xiao more buy realme pro for allround performance
Infinix,Zero X Pro,that sucks on aliexpress rn its going for which is steal for this hardware but the more my honest opinion go for it and get one think that this phone offers lot even in its original price and most phones with same specs finish and extras costs way more than it the price they are asking nowadays on aliexpress is more than enough reason to get one cameras deliver solid quality even moon shots are great if you spend some time tweeking the settings pro mode also makes wonders if you know how to use the basics battery is solid and charging speed is fast enough no android update but security patches are coming each months more or less by the way the last security patch is from june and google play system update from july one sad thing is that aliexpress stores are only selling the starry silver variant mine is the nebula black and man the back finish looks amazing but its fingerprint magnet wish could get the tuscany brown because of the veganfaux leather on the back instead of glass but was available only in certain markets
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no unfortunately that sucks on aliexpress rn its going for which is steal for this hardware but the color calibration of the screen is oversaturated with no way of changing it which is dealbreaker for me
Infinix,Zero X Pro,did they ever add screen color profiles or color picker no unfortunately
Infinix,Zero X Pro,nice they copied ultra before its out in terms of what
Infinix,Zero X Pro,this good phone the problems is that it is android no updates to other versions
Infinix,Zero X Pro,the best up to this day have using it one year now is there any infinix as good as this phone try infinix notte pro
Infinix,Zero X Pro,oooh men this phone is buzzing cool just got mine now did get any problem using it
Infinix,Zero X Pro,the price dropped similar to regular poco pro in my place which is cool
Infinix,Zero X Pro,realme is far better realme doesnt have telephoto and ultrawide just single cam phone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,phone master and xos launcher are two major problems of all infinix phones both starts to bug more was planning to buy this model you think it still worth it or not cause my recent phone xiaomi got problem with motherboard now im thinking either to buy this model or realme pro
Infinix,Zero X Pro,its because of phone master update kindly uninstall upgrade and then restart its ok mine was more phone master and xos launcher are two major problems of all infinix phones both starts to bug the whole interface after being updated
Infinix,Zero X Pro,same thing its happening to my phone too got it last year october green lines appear more its because of phone master update kindly uninstall upgrade and then restart its ok mine was same but after this phone master uninstall its ok now
Infinix,Zero X Pro,which is better infinix zero or tecno phantom
Infinix,Zero X Pro,to meits the best phone ive seenused
Infinix,Zero X Pro,anyone tried photos on facebook it doesnt move when you tilt the phone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,its name shadow is it normal
Infinix,Zero X Pro,so weird it doesnt have nfc if it had would buy it right away
Infinix,Zero X Pro,bought zero pro yesterday and am already regretting thought it would be running on xos more got the same problem how did solve it dont want my data deleted
Infinix,Zero X Pro,see mixed opinions here and the gsmarena review is kind of discouraging have limited more get infinix is genuinely trash is alright but still slower with worse screen than infinix youre also not getting telephoto lens video or hz same with xiaomi
Infinix,Zero X Pro,downgrade xos launcher reboot problem solved yeah the original version works fine no need to update at least until they solve this reboot problem
Infinix,Zero X Pro,your phone has probably some issue in regards of overheating have one for over month and more thats true after update
Infinix,Zero X Pro,after last system update june the phone doesnt restart properly instead it keeps re more yes same issue with my phone also
Infinix,Zero X Pro,it seems to look like flagship device but its just budgetmidrange level though theyd better use snapdragon chipset to make it more competitive with other phone brands
Infinix,Zero X Pro,most recent security and google updates palm id similar to mi account on xiaomi phones to infinix id you must create an account log in and reset the phone again it will work as cloud for some files and phone numbers aside from that didnt noticed any other changes on software or apps after the update
Infinix,Zero X Pro,bokeh video or photos not available in the moblie let me correct you it can do bokeh videos in pfps with both main and selfie cameras it also has slide control that allows you to control the amount of effect you want on video the funny part is that even if theres no native bokeh photos the phone allows you to take pictures while filming bokeh video so you have pics with the effect
Infinix,Zero X Pro,will infinix zero pro can get android update no infinix never updates the os version
Infinix,Zero X Pro,only problem have with infinix is the ui use dual whatsapp and on the clone one cant op more yeah literally
Infinix,Zero X Pro,would be funny if xiaomi steals the design of this phone and used sd or higher then name more hm makes you wonder what if someone makes an exact copy of this phone with an selling for
Infinix,Zero X Pro,they put several good specifications only if they add or processor from mediatek the phone will be the bestselling because of its price and it will not increase much even after adding it only
Infinix,Zero X Pro,the top of brust issues with software its proved in updates but not major fix of app crashing and many more issues found no better than other samsung oppo or xiaomi devices in this range also in camera havent found brightness lock af lock and the camera doesnt make detail photos as compare to other devices with same price range like redmi note pro and realme pro my opinion is xiaomi for everything you want better than all of this device except look
Infinix,Zero X Pro,where do can find this phone on occidental market
Infinix,Zero X Pro,lol another cheaper without dual speaker xd dont fall for hype
Infinix,Zero X Pro,should have included gorilla glass protection really dont understand this gorilla glass protection is gorilla actually gonna scratch on the glass other than human fingers
Infinix,Zero X Pro,somebody please help me with minimum of ki really need it and god almighty shall bless you you can buy one plus in
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix is chinese infinix is hong kong please
Infinix,Zero X Pro,ignore him hes an xiaomi stan yeah he absolutely is
Infinix,Zero X Pro,im spreading lies what are you talking about use redmi note pro and have more ignore him hes an xiaomi stan
Infinix,Zero X Pro,have xiaomi note and installed vanced tube on it no problem stop spreading lies infi more and before you scream about your phone not having worse specs first think about whether or not you have hz screen and gb storage
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no its hongkong hong kong or china it doesnt matter they are somehow same country
Infinix,Zero X Pro,midrange priced phone without nfc
Infinix,Zero X Pro,actually disagree ive seen so many people use gestures for navigation on xiaomi phone more httpsyoutubecomchannelucbmnzdiimiaolmlrdq pls subscribe to this channel
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no promised android os updates xa waste or gb ram phone no more infinix lie sell technique
Infinix,Zero X Pro,miui launcher clicked submit by mistake miui doesnt like you installing launcher more actually disagree ive seen so many people use gestures for navigation on xiaomi phones also if you put your youtube channel in here can subscribe and throw comment in
Infinix,Zero X Pro,pixel ui is the best ui hz is now thing of the past phones though disappointing pixels more the thing is ui skin impacts performance this is not gaming fps performance am talking about this is application performance switching between apps
Infinix,Zero X Pro,check out this wild thing just compared my pixel as hz and ss hz and th more faster better chipset on the samsung if they had the same chip their hz would look the same because samsungs ui optimization is pretty good
Infinix,Zero X Pro,are you saying if get xiaomi phone and put launcher on it all or most of the software more pixel ui is the best ui hz is now thing of the past phones though disappointing pixels stock ui makes up for it no bloatware no ads no nonsensical effects that slow the chipset down pixel and pro come with above right if they sold im my country xiaomi midrangers probably would not even be an option for me would never have gotten this phone though dont get me wrong am definitely happy with its performance not its ui skin xiaomis ui is feature packed but their decisions on what to keep and what to restrict is what has people mad with bugs on top
Infinix,Zero X Pro,of course can compare the hz smoothness dont have to use scrolling to make more are you saying if get xiaomi phone and put launcher on it all or most of the software problems will be solved then why are people complaining about xiaomi phones theyre like google pixel is the best as it has and even though it has hz and slow charging compared to hz and fast charging on xiaomis its software advantage trumps all but if xiaomis software issue can be resolved then actually redmis will be better than crppy pixel series
Infinix,Zero X Pro,um what are you talking about xd did anyone ever tell you miui and xos are so bad hz is more you are contradicting yourself first you say the skins do not affect the frame rates then you say it even drops frames in the app drawer im trying to understand what is behind this because people say google and nokia phones are the best and im like but they dont have that much good specs but guess software overrules everything for user experience im like but this xiaomi or samsung phone has wayyy better specs like hz oled and super fast charging but they say these xiaomi phones have heavy and laggy software call it skins if you want that slows the phones down even though they have hz
Infinix,Zero X Pro,okay if you have both infinix and xiaomi redmi note pro can you compare the smoothness of more of course can compare the hz smoothness dont have to use scrolling to make my comparison everytime can use games apps that arent the system launchers because those are the maximum lag causers system launchers on skins are the worst so have hundreds of alternatives hz on both these phones look exactly the same my tests are now about performance can the zero pro stay at hz and not drop frames on light games how about heavy games does it handle uncapped frames well these are the things want to find out comparing their hz in scrolling is not problem because of their software they look the same just like any hz would and thats good thing like mentioned before the is not joke its capable so is sdg
Infinix,Zero X Pro,oh the skin is heavy alright but him saying hz on stock android is smoother is not true more okay if you have both infinix and xiaomi redmi note pro can you compare the smoothness of their hz displays given their buggy softwares
Infinix,Zero X Pro,lol stock android hz on this phone would have killed the competition if infinix had any more oxygen os is the best chinese skin no ads or bloatware hope the merger with oppo will not ruin it
Infinix,Zero X Pro,used one from friend the xos skin is heavy and the hz is not that good hz on stock an more lol stock android hz on this phone would have killed the competition if infinix had any everyone is above them except tecno lol they really need to drop their skin its ugly and blatant ripoff of ios not to mention the ads oh lord the ads xos is utter trash and the system installs apps you dont even know about or use disgusting but on the bright side the on this phone is not joke its capable of doing things quicker than expected it may be on par with snapdragon but it slightly outperforms auto rotate is faster some apps open faster asphalt gives slightly better graphics light motion blur and water droplets that not available on redmi note pro still runs at fps though gamelofts enforced frame cap im still doing other tests to see just how beefy it actually is compared to the best value budget phone of this year redmi note pro but hz is very good here honestly speaking its not as good on note pro is little better than thats probably why feel anyone who gets this phone especially where its mostly sold should be satisfied with its midrange specs
Infinix,Zero X Pro,sure the skin is heavy in the photos in the review at gsmarena the home screen looks very more oh the skin is heavy alright but him saying hz on stock android is smoother is not true would throw away any skin for stock android but hz on this phone is sure as heck better than hz on stock android unless hes saying the phone hes using just stutters lot everywhere the hz on this phone works as good as youd expect lags caused by xos are very minor im currently running tests on it and gotta admit the quality here is surprising for infinix their note pro was disgraceful ux wise even the note pro stutters at hz as well but this looks just little promising could be because they are using the xos launcher now that is trash use new launcher and the phone may get little smoother overall this phone is surprisingly good ngl its beauty and performance are on point im redmi note pro user btw just speaking from tests of the zero pro
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no cases for zero pri
Infinix,Zero X Pro,finger print is very slowly work at least it works
Infinix,Zero X Pro,well good but put in ur mind that infinix is far better than tecno in every aspects sure
Infinix,Zero X Pro,oh its available everywhere alright just not very popular after all infinix is pret more please disregard this comment realised that what said might be wrong please dont read it idk if this phone will recieve updates or not
Infinix,Zero X Pro,completely trash euro for and infinix was going to refute that argument then hopped on to ebay and tried looking for cheap infinix zero pro and couldnt find any infinix phone other than note pro calling infinix rare brand is an understatement
Infinix,Zero X Pro,buy other reliable brand more expensive but more reliable check out the review for this phone for photo and video editing you will need fast chipset and helio on this phone is equivalent to sd aka good but not great performance you would probably be better off with phone with or dimensity or chipset using gsmarenas phone finder here is link of list of phones you could buy httpswwwgsmarenacomresultsphpnyearminnramminschipset
Infinix,Zero X Pro,what think is that if anyone thinks this is good phone they should go for it
Infinix,Zero X Pro,tcl much better than this cheaper too with sdxx socs better updates too
Infinix,Zero X Pro,better getting xiaomi poco pro lol
Infinix,Zero X Pro,this company never updates its phones dont ever go for it
Infinix,Zero X Pro,for that price better get motorola instead much better soc eg sdxx or dimensity series ready phone with much better update support xiaomirealme also better with ready phones also better custom rom support
Infinix,Zero X Pro,motorola is good option like this mobile
Infinix,Zero X Pro,hello can someone guide me im not mobile gamer need mobile for my daily use more motorola is good option
Infinix,Zero X Pro,too much bloatware just setup nextdns and youre good to go
Infinix,Zero X Pro,always love the design like this only the design not the spec ill skip this one blehhh
Infinix,Zero X Pro,only one big very bad finger print sensor tired up it missed lot
Infinix,Zero X Pro,jamesd oct its nice phone apart from the lack of which is very annoying lack of is still normal for most country which still on trial and limited service coverage but using helio is not really good as the selling point besides it has hz and ois plus periscope tele which expensive
Infinix,Zero X Pro,is not yet available isnt available yet on markets where infinix is present it won more to help you furthernon implementation of in such countries where infinix sales is not an excuse for underdevelopmentblame it on low purchasing power of the market which the likes of infinix and tecno are feeding fat onlet infinixtecno try us or european countries even chinalets see how they ll survive the competition there
Infinix,Zero X Pro,wheres the review
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no review of gsmarena
Infinix,Zero X Pro,was disappointed because really waited for this one not really worth the hype and price more will do zero is far better than redmi note pro
Infinix,Zero X Pro,between zero pro and used iphone xs which should go for guys but seem to be at the more used year old iphone xs do you want to be glued permanently to charging source by now the battery will be worse than terrible buy the infinix pro
Infinix,Zero X Pro,video review plz
Infinix,Zero X Pro,why hasnt gsmarena released their review yet theyve had the phone for almost month now
Infinix,Zero X Pro,camera setup is what that distinguishes this phone processor and battery are not ideal but not bad either rest of specs are ok the main issue for me is lack of gorilla glass glass on front glass on back but no gorilla glass protection very strange
Infinix,Zero X Pro,still shitty chipset helio is known for overheating issues dont know why they put ad more helio is known for overheating issues are you that primitive need some serious tech updates
Infinix,Zero X Pro,seems to be misgiving
Infinix,Zero X Pro,fyi camera is also midrange optical zoom but with mp this is the same sensor from pro which an ex flagship sensor samsung hm sensor midrange mp sensor mp ultra wide hmm typical of mid range phone nothing special is midrange from
Infinix,Zero X Pro,is poco pro better dont ask for game my game is genshin impact and codm yes by big margin
Infinix,Zero X Pro,seems nice phone but gorilla glass protection is missing
Infinix,Zero X Pro,is the price close to the samsung and poco its only watch unbox diaries for review
Infinix,Zero X Pro,price released us no same as sdg and gt no nfc no hdr to much infinix more doesnt need cause signal can be block easily than or dont know
Infinix,Zero X Pro,dear price tag will matter for zero series if price would be justified according to pak market then this series may be good option otherwise so many other options are there in the field
Infinix,Zero X Pro,waiting for infinix model with dimensity or snapdragon chipset
Infinix,Zero X Pro,if they used any dimensity based soc thats that would be awesome
Infinix,Zero X Pro,which kind yeye phone be dis one na nor dey work well dey play game before na the cor off more hmmm
Infinix,Zero X Pro,nfc snapdragon at least what shame that could fight in this area okay more on note pro they said is same cpu but its gtso think the real cpu on this one will be gt too
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no hdr no nfc no
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no nfc too bad
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix best brand in indonesian but why just limit why not try for product infinix does not have any phones yet because they dont have some approval for modems made by companies who also use us equipment even if the equipment is not used in manufacturing the parts this is also the reason huawei could not release phones since the nova
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no
Infinix,Zero X Pro,why not upgrade the battery to mah long lasting battery is the sweetness of smart phon more have good comment
Infinix,Zero X Pro,zero has flash charge and could charge from zero to hundred percent within ten minu more the zero has as well the prototype was the one with the charging it wont come to mass production for another to generations if at all
Infinix,Zero X Pro,hallo why is this company continued making ph of not ph they cant see company arising with lot of competition while infinix and tecno continued making same ph style up this company
Infinix,Zero X Pro,cool but not feeling the battery
Infinix,Zero X Pro,dear gsma rena kindly reviews zero pro because your analayes is best for consumer
Infinix,Zero X Pro,why no hdr
Infinix,Zero X Pro,dumbest invention guess their target is nigeria so that when the battery feature is low an more you must be stupid to address individuals from whole country this way know youre nigerian too so show some respect bro
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix concept phone had the watt chargerits unfortunate that it wasnt launchedthe zero is really cool phone with the amoled display and the hz refresh rate and the superb mp with the super moon modebig ups to infinix but they should work on the batteryanyways will be glad to have one though
Infinix,Zero X Pro,for flagship phone to come with local gorilla glass not even on the back and front and framed with plastic framing is brainless of work and also with mp selfie camera think infinix can do more better than that
Infinix,Zero X Pro,zero fingerprint sensor is on the power button not under the display the zero pro has an under display fingerprint while the zero neo has side mounted fingerprint
Infinix,Zero X Pro,wow is so amazing
Infinix,Zero X Pro,please tell fps video recording is available or not
Infinix,Zero X Pro,mediatek helio is not all that bad for midrange phone as some of you are saying at least its slightly more powerful than snapdragon powering galaxy
Infinix,Zero X Pro,lol if dont want ur phone to not get damage or break then should be extra careful using more the money
Infinix,Zero X Pro,at least appreciate for onceyou condemnation is much is herehaba do your own lets seeat least the phone is super good
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no protection at alluseless phoneno dust or water resistance no gorilla glass use more lol if dont want ur phone to not get damage or break then should be extra careful using it dont need gorilla glass or ip dust restistance or water resistancejust bit of tempered glass and case is ok
Infinix,Zero X Pro,does this actually have dual speakers flossy carter said there was only one they have two one at the bottom and the other one in calling speaker
Infinix,Zero X Pro,awesome phone just minutes full charger haha is in one hour not minutes
Infinix,Zero X Pro,very true mediatek and below they only support mp camera lens but not mp caps at
Infinix,Zero X Pro,will rather go for nokia product nokia have trash value for price these days
Infinix,Zero X Pro,even infinix note uses mah battery so what do you mean by copying iphone technology ev more he is joking bro the iphone and iphone isnt even released anyway
Infinix,Zero X Pro,wow gsmarena is very slow flossy carter already reviewed this phone on his yt channel more who tf is flossy cartel we trus tgsmarena and rather wist then watching random person would even rather watch mkbhdtroll rathe rthan this guy
Infinix,Zero X Pro,right that doesnt even support mp camera so there will be no true mp images very true mediatek and below they only support mp camera lens but not mp
Infinix,Zero X Pro,youve never tried vivo batteries or gionee
Infinix,Zero X Pro,how much updates did it have infinix and tecno etc phones usually only have major os update more will rather go for nokia product
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix should work on how they do something in their phones if not tecno will over come them more how much updates did it have infinix and tecno etc phones usually only have major os update or even none or year security updates or years so if it lasted only os update thne yes cant expect
Infinix,Zero X Pro,this is romours which mean it may have an hz display infinix should work on how they do something in their phones if not tecno will over come them using infinix zero now but no new update so dont know they should work on something if not well stop buying their phones move to samsung
Infinix,Zero X Pro,please add modal on its photos up there thnx
Infinix,Zero X Pro,this is rubbish you guys still used the old chipset found on the note pro come on will the world end if you guys use dimensity and above what about network
Infinix,Zero X Pro,even samsung mah battery never lasts like infinix mah battery when it comes to batter more youve never tried vivo batteries
Infinix,Zero X Pro,very useless without in you do realise the markets for this phone right few if any have good support
Infinix,Zero X Pro,says who its all lies use infinix and they update their os they dont update their os that thing you receive is security patch update
Infinix,Zero X Pro,lastly it is still mediatek phone no nfc no ir blaster
Infinix,Zero X Pro,youre correct they never give android update they couldnt even give android upda more even samsung mah battery never lasts like infinix mah battery when it comes to battery strength you can never take it away from infinix infinix note battery that have been using for years still lasts whole day without charging despite years of usage
Infinix,Zero X Pro,dont forget theyre also cheating copying the charging from the iphone the more even infinix note uses mah battery so what do you mean by copying iphone technology evolves so its not about copying doubt if you are conversant with infinix
Infinix,Zero X Pro,lots of congratulations to infinix for finally producing an almost pocketable phone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,giving black wallpaper seems like companies are trying to hide their shame of giving notch they think they can fool the consumers again and again by taking apple strategy
Infinix,Zero X Pro,back camera shape like mi just small difference
Infinix,Zero X Pro,did just see amoled thats good direction
Infinix,Zero X Pro,expected it to come with charger but very disappointed maybe let me wait for official more its official dear they mentioned same specs on instahram too that charger was just advertisement
Infinix,Zero X Pro,swear every phone is called pro nowadays it doesnt sound exclusive anymor more it already exclusive enough with the optical zoom and mp not to mention other specs for just
Infinix,Zero X Pro,dont waste your cash on this phone it nothing
Infinix,Zero X Pro,once again android cheats iphone for the side yes it is dont forget theyre also cheating copying the charging from the iphone the hz of the iphone the mah battery from the iphone and the mm jack from the iphone sneaky bastards
Infinix,Zero X Pro,that thing is almost like years old nowshould come with the newer dimensity indeed nm overheating after min of normal use
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix favourite processor
Infinix,Zero X Pro,if they want to use mediatek then why not go with dimensity or something although like this design
Infinix,Zero X Pro,for totally normal smartphone without any fancy or advanced features this is actually not too bad helio is still potent chipset for everyday use
Infinix,Zero X Pro,not even launched by infinix again phone its not like is relevant anyway you cant even enjoy that until two or three or even five years time
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no nfc downgraded battery capacity no fast charging helio cpu no if the price isnt low this phone can not compete with others
Infinix,Zero X Pro,now using infinix note is very smooth but infinix zero pro think maybe deserve
Infinix,Zero X Pro,sorry for wrong conservation there is dedicated sd card slot but only single sim
Infinix,Zero X Pro,my question is why only mp wide angle camera
Infinix,Zero X Pro,this battery couldve been mah downgrade to this phone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,that is one chunky phone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,it will support sim no it doesnt have
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix zero series never disappoint
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix zero is being waited when it will be available launched awesome
Infinix,Zero X Pro,will be waiting for infinix neo or infinix pro with mah provided that their prices more mean ugx million
Infinix,Zero X Pro,whatever the price im gonna buy it
Infinix,Zero X Pro,it ought to be phone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,wat is this watt can not believe big thank ti infinix phones and amoled screen
Infinix,Zero X Pro,no
Infinix,Zero X Pro,hope its ready
Infinix,Zero X Pro,am tired of the rumored edition cant wait to grasp the real stuff when is infinix ze more me too
Infinix,Zero X Pro,one trick circus fact dingle dangle chinese brands rarely get software update if ever only reliable chinese brands left viable internationally are oneplus and xiaomi others rarely release stable global roms
Infinix,Zero X Pro,that charging is very important
Infinix,Zero X Pro,wish its sd
Infinix,Zero X Pro,the rumored battery is too low for the expected device it should be amhamh
Infinix,Zero X Pro,when can we buy this phone in nigeria and italy
Infinix,Zero X Pro,sd is very efficient tho heating issue just destroy it and helio is bad if the batte more heating issues ruin it but have seen single sd phone that crosses hr in endurance test no right thats cuz sd is very power hungry and power efficient plus this is concept phone its not going to be officially released in europe or us prob only given to reviewers and specific regions otherwise china only they may make zero pro which mean should be better here waht it needs display hz amoled hdr
Infinix,Zero X Pro,mp camera watt fast charging with lowest processor laugh with oo they should reduce the mp number and just increase the quality
Infinix,Zero X Pro,reduce the mp and improve mp quality picture because number of pixels dont matter what matters is how well it take and process the image can as well copy the camera software of google pixel and improve the mp and also the battery is essential especially when your main customer are from africa and add also atleast corning gorilla glass and balance the price from reducing the pixel but the size is superior medium phablet keep it up infinix from leo
Infinix,Zero X Pro,seeing the camera resolution it should have sd or mtk dimensity or
Infinix,Zero X Pro,nubs it says unofficial specs so shut up and wait also in which midrange phone can find per more sd is very efficient tho heating issue just destroy it and helio is bad if the battery is mah
Infinix,Zero X Pro,ill rather have you guys not release it at all if it will be overpriced like phantom
Infinix,Zero X Pro,great phone coming from infinix but need battery improvement
Infinix,Zero X Pro,lowkey the chipset make it bad its true the phone looks promising but the chip set is the only weaknessthey could have used snapdragon instead
Infinix,Zero X Pro,for the people who are saying why it has bad chipset and stuff its because its still concept phone meaning that they just put the concept stuff inside the phone and added the rest inside the phone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,the is the only problem see we wont know anything till it launches
Infinix,Zero X Pro,gionee battery is mah you meant
Infinix,Zero X Pro,the phone is wonderful phone but the mah battery is not enough was expecting more you are complaining of battery size that lasts mins while charging lol id take that any day rather than having bigger battery thats going to take over an hr to fill up
Infinix,Zero X Pro,might not be the best but its huge leap for infinix dope designs cool features great camera guess infinix are really stepping up to the challenge
Infinix,Zero X Pro,pixel binning or quad bayer is the solution there is no phone with mah even the iphone pro max has mah
Infinix,Zero X Pro,helio support up to mp cam pixel binning or quad bayer is the solution
Infinix,Zero X Pro,so with all the fast charging its got just mah battery was even expecting at least mah battery capacity with looks nice though
Infinix,Zero X Pro,phone body design is very cool especially the glowing back which can be notification light more helio support up to mp cam
Infinix,Zero X Pro,now know why curved screen is cancer my god that look absolutely hideous
Infinix,Zero X Pro,expect better battery like battery should have been or even more
Infinix,Zero X Pro,maybe stronger chipset like mediatek dimensity helio is not enough and larger battery like mah
Infinix,Zero X Pro,it belongs in the bin helio chips lmao replace it with gb ram its prototype not finished product
Infinix,Zero X Pro,mtk helio
Infinix,Zero X Pro,know right doesnt make one sense thought before seeing this phones spics that theyll use sd or even processor from the series from qualcommbut helio is not good idea for real charging power and mp camera need powerful processor right or im wrong infinixs faliure
Infinix,Zero X Pro,need one of dimensity ois for cam cgg protection
Infinix,Zero X Pro,mah this one must be compact one just like meizu zenfone btw mmmm tall httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Infinix,Zero X Pro,ill love to have the phone the memory space is interesting
Infinix,Zero X Pro,and battery lol hr of screen time max
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix and tecno do what ever you do you cant beat redmi and samsung chinese th class chi more as samsung user can say ur comment is full of bull
Infinix,Zero X Pro,what you all expect from mid range brand flagship chipset and better battery the charging speed the periscope tele and the display is huge improvement already
Infinix,Zero X Pro,mi httpsmgsmarenacomxiaomimiiphp realme superzoom httpsmgsmarenacomrealmexsuperzoompricephp mi youth httpsmgsmarenacomxiaomimiyouthgphp
Infinix,Zero X Pro,put good gaming processor network should have also the battery should be mh data might be too expensive for most believe would gladly choose even in years come
Infinix,Zero X Pro,come on its waste to put put something like thats to youbut to me its great
Infinix,Zero X Pro,weak mediatek chip no ois on main or periscope cam this will literally be among the worst de more oh please this phone stomps the samsung aam etc in specs speed and performance
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix is very funny mah for inches displayno water resistanceno low resolut more oh please you the funny one are better than infinix at making smartphones
Infinix,Zero X Pro,all of these specs aint correct zero is different from concept phone also the more thats why it says unofficial preliminary specifications at the top
Infinix,Zero X Pro,please have at least dimensity chip
Infinix,Zero X Pro,my next phone spotted can it play asphalt tho
Infinix,Zero X Pro,what is that aspect ratio man
Infinix,Zero X Pro,crazy
Infinix,Zero X Pro,if zero comes up as you described it must be inferior to zero lets wait for the real thing to come out
Infinix,Zero X Pro,why helio soc everything else in the phone is so good like the cameras and fast chargin more stay there nd wait for sd or sd from infinix dont go and get xiaomi or oneplus device go wait tire lmao
Infinix,Zero X Pro,meh chipset and mediocre battery size make it seem like this phone will be gimmick
Infinix,Zero X Pro,battery capacity to small
Infinix,Zero X Pro,wow lol mpx with periscope is mediocre lol what about the imx on samsung phones and more this phone is supposed to be an upper midranger and its coming out as concept phone barely any midrange phone has charging speed above or also almost all are missing wireless charging coil this supports yea the specs of the phone on paper look like cheap knockoff category but this is good one also please refrain yourself from swearing in this website this is from the gsmarena rules
Infinix,Zero X Pro,infinix wow mind blowing innovation this is literally the best thing ever finally something worth flagship cant wait
Infinix,Zero X Pro,lol periscope telephoto but no ois
Infinix,Zero X Pro,im sure this will not popular in my country every top big brands already conquered the phone market in here
Infinix,Zero X Pro,oooooo shocked to see the specification
Infinix,Zero X Pro,it is mind blowing osm device with epic specs sheet
Infinix,Zero X Pro,premium looking device with year old budget midend chipsetmeh
Infinix,Zero X Pro,wait what
Infinix,Zero X,zero and zero xpro are very high phonesif you want an upgrade first restart then you will more are you in africa which kind of air do want to cool it down
Infinix,Zero X,its already xos why cant update new version android for zero pro
Infinix,Zero X,friends of this infinix zero phone when will it be updated to xos its already xos
Infinix,Zero X,red marks on screen and phone is always hot take few pictures and it will shut down took more how did you fix the red marks issuesany solution
Infinix,Zero X,infinix zeyo reriew
Infinix,Zero X,this phone zero is always hot have returned it twice to the company still doing the same thi more so true the temperature of the phone is big issue and have no idea whether this information has reached the phone company or not everything about the phone is on point but the temperature you cant record mins video without the camera turning off due to an increase in temperature this is so badinfinix must do something about it cos its money
Infinix,Zero X,im glad tried to find out about the performance before purchasing it more than people complained about the phone temperature thats no for me
Infinix,Zero X,go and buy samsung if you want snapdragon processor nope helio give more performance compared to price and other shipsets and samsung is overpriced compared to what it give for example if you buy samsung phone with dollars you get snapdragon from and poor performace
Infinix,Zero X,infinix would just reuse on these series of smartphones why they dont make phones more go and buy samsung if you want snapdragon processor
Infinix,Zero X,infinix really needs to decide about the updateswe cant change our phone everytime new android version releasingif they sont update their android versions will never buy their productszero has so many bugs but non of them have been resolved by infinix
Infinix,Zero X,my mobile phone camera automaticily off mobile temperchier to high
Infinix,Zero X,mine just fell down the first time and the screen got blind immediately ever since then have more unfortunately nowhere you can find
Infinix,Zero X,the display is very poor despite being amoled
Infinix,Zero X,infinix zero pro is moon shot camera imagine mp periscope zoom that mp camera only has zoom it cant take zoom on that mp camera at all
Infinix,Zero X,yup nfc is very useful in china and japan at least my infinix zero is always hot when am using the phone and need to know why
Infinix,Zero X,do people often use nfc in phones more than qr some complaints makes it seem like nfc is the more yup nfc is very useful in china and japan at least
Infinix,Zero X,wait no nfc do people often use nfc in phones more than qr some complaints makes it seem like nfc is the main deal in smartphone especially if the phone doesnt having nfc think infrared option will be more practical than nfc
Infinix,Zero X,why its only side mounted finger print sensor and not indisplay its only on the zero pro
Infinix,Zero X,zero not supported ois not finger printed under display not dual speakers its only available on the zero pro version with gb ram storage
Infinix,Zero X,last security update for august where is new update for infinix zero
Infinix,Zero X,so samsung galaxy ultra was charging is huawei nova was charging is hu more is infinix zero available in pakistan
Infinix,Zero X,let patiently wait for them to release dimensity in their next release with not much more infinix zero pro is moon shot camera imagine mp periscope zoom
Infinix,Zero X,fingerprint is side mounted not under display
Infinix,Zero X,released on rd quarter of the year yet still no
Infinix,Zero X,not
Infinix,Zero X,no upgrade for chipset still helio its good one but they have inf note pro already expect some or dimensity
Infinix,Zero X,very interesting here some people expressing their ignorance like their experts
Infinix,Zero X,are dual speakers confirmed saw in flossy carters review that there was just single speaker
Infinix,Zero X,why will anyone buy infinix phone again infinix dont give android os update it doesn more infinix do give android os update
Infinix,Zero X,what if the price is left are you still going to buy this phone well then probably not since it uses an old chipset and doesnt really have something that would make it any better than the redmi note pro for me the only thing that might make it better is the price moreover am still skeptical about infinixs ability to provide software updates hence the only reason to go for it would be an affordable price point
Infinix,Zero X,jesus why that stupid again they should have used or instead let patiently wait for them to release dimensity in their next release with not much of price difference it already crazy cheap with all those specs as for now
Infinix,Zero X,its funny they want to take good moonshot with mp camera and zoom xiaomi and samsung can not take good moonshot with and xthats why said before this phone does nothing special and that was advertisement not good for gaming doesnt have good battery no nfc no os update at all gonna buy note pro instead
Infinix,Zero X,it seems that the only difference between this and the pro variant is the main camera sensor and gb storage option other than that everything is identical since both this and the pro variant have dedicated microsd card slot this looks like great value smartphone
Infinix,Zero X,love infinix phones but they are falling short on display and battery got to do better
Infinix,Zero X,display and battery is disappointing they have phones with mah batteries and how would they fit periscope lens with mah without making brick
Infinix,Zero X,this reminds me of the little
