Huawei,Enjoy 20 Plus 5G,heavy and bulky which huawei is not knows as aslo no google no google is good thing imo only use driod approved apps
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Plus 5G,this looks really good for the price huawei doing good things
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,trust me this is totally trash
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,based on the supply chain information huawei is the number one smartphone seller worldwide fo more no lol
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,no google still dead like windows
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,unless you need banking app demanding gms or is hardcore pokemon go player that needs goog more with new devices handicapped from launch chips running out and now older devices having an unclear future things simply arent looking good for huaweis smartphone business at all
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,very good that no google hope soon they realese not google phone
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,may offer you the honor youth its euros right
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,thats really great phone that wish could buy wish that was able to buy it but more may offer you the honor youth its euros
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,really lile huawei but dont know what happned in there few products expensive and low qual more who said they make low quality phone take this one for example for euros youre getting large battery decent chip for the price good cameras now onto the series would go for the pro if could get without google which trump banned from huawei best cameras in the industry period larger sensor digital zoom fps video standard flagship display may not be the best but is at the bleeding edge of it with hz display you cant feel the difference hz vs hz resolution display the quad curve is gimmick but is welcomed chip is great battery charging and for less than euros software though destroys it all for westerners like myself no gms sucks
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,why huawei phones are not with gorilla glass protection and they never used amoled or super am more they come with better screen protection than gorilla they just dont advertise it
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,have always been like this yes but now see more people which are willing to do this more more more people around me switching huawei from samsung myself is getting more interested to it as well actually hard ly even search for huawei phones until recent ly bcos of their news getting banned from then on it catches my attention since then more look at huawei phones more got interested in them often search for their phones specifications others too actually this way they helping promoting huawei the rest of the world getting more sympathize from people somehow indirectly this saved unmeasurable marketing costs for huawei to market their products to the whole world usa are doing them favour so we new huawei buyers those other new potential buyers in the coming future would like thank them acting as free marketing tool
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,huawei no never
Huawei,Enjoy 20 Pro,huawei release their genius petal search app now so now new huawei phones can find nearly eve more yes petal search
Huawei,Enjoy 20 SE,how can this phone get emui and smart not get same device
Huawei,Enjoy 20 SE,always time huawei design is bad and not same the old version devices and without identifi more you know that they are using the default font right you can change the font your self
Huawei,Enjoy 20 SE,and wdym
Huawei,Enjoy 20 SE,am fan of nokia and also live samsung buy some people can be funny in some comment session you will just find them coming under any phone model and make useless comment by condemning phone that they have not even bought or used its funny some have not even bought this phone to use just seeing the specs they will start complaining and condemning to discourage others from buying and using it bunch of idol and lax folks
Huawei,Enjoy 20 SE,also smart and
Huawei,Enjoy 20 SE,renamed huawei ya also smart
Huawei,Enjoy 20 SE,not this phone for gamer only daily small use
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,thats the problem of huawei they should release one new model in each segment every years at least like series
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,nice phone
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,it look like huawei yp device lol isnt only because its literally the same phone with different name
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,huawei enjoy what to enjoy enjoy that the only good company is out of the picture thanks to america and now were left with crappy devices and crappy overheating chipsets
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,wow first cheapest harmony os phone
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,the back of this phone looks like
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,enjoy no away from me
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,ys is better than this and same price huawei you should be stronger tgan that
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,huawei should be launched like nova lite im using lite
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,will it be only in china or global launchfor correction huawei should be launched like nova lite
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,this company makes me cry they were the top phone makers and now everyone is slowly forgetting about them nd by the way this phone chipset is no go for me
Huawei,Enjoy 20e,deleted post will it be only in china or global launchfor correction
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,is it available in the kingdom of eswatini china only
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,specs seems fair for price the only sad part is the mp front cam
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,can they actually come with their own design as an android user feel so ashamed with these more recently had conversation with someone that in the past think phones on display were showing their front now phones on display are showing their back because apparently thats the only part of them that sets them apart they are all just too similar miss when there used to be android phones with more rectangular shapes and sharper corners now it feels like all phones are copies of other copies of other copies its not just huawei even samsung and others are doing it huawei are just the most blatant copycats think only sony has remained original with their designs would love to have sony phone but too expensive for me at this point
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,one of the best
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,am very big fan of huawei but this is complete disaster especially that iphone design th more iphone was the last one to come out with second or third camera
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,rest in peace huawei
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,will this be using another recycled kirin soc probably
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,the camera is like iphone
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,uhmm what to enjoy agree seriously what to enjoy
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,like it already
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,this is just copy of another phone nothing to enjoy
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,ir does not seem bad vfm
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,for what
Huawei,Enjoy 50z,why do they have to copy iphones design cant they think of an original design
Huawei,Enjoy 60 Pro,is it just me or did this phone only show up on gsmarena now yea most likely because it has only two opinions and its listed in latest devices and it has no wayback machine saves
Huawei,Enjoy 60 Pro,they be doing anything to go on global market why cant they just use snapdragon gen series or series
Huawei,Enjoy 60,what unit is this phone there is no available phimone case and cant find it
Huawei,Enjoy 60,the name is rather weird for smartphone enjoy budget specs nova is better this is literal translation from chinese its original name contains chinese and nova is another series of huawei
Huawei,Enjoy 60,well im sorry but can totally tell the difference between ips and tft and especially more it is nonsense it can carry audiomax
Huawei,Enjoy 60,and samsung is still using it on their tab yet they make it so high quality think you ca more well im sorry but can totally tell the difference between ips and tft and especially between tft and oled but maybe on tablet its okay because it definitely is for monitors but for phone its just outdated technology
Huawei,Enjoy 60,tft should be illegal in it actually shouldve already been starting from like and samsung is still using it on their tab yet they make it so high quality think you cant tell any difference from amoled from the normal human sight
Huawei,Enjoy 60,assume this phone uses ovb sensor according to omnivision website the sensor is capable more itll be the isp that dictates the video capture rate if the sensor can actuall do higher than pfps or think the manufacture can decide to restrict it deliberately also im confused it can do at fps but at fps weird way they have explained it youd think they would put or just fps sort of thing
Huawei,Enjoy 60,all the naysayers talking smack about this phone really need ro remove their heads from their more the name is rather weird for smartphone enjoy budget specs nova is better
Huawei,Enjoy 60,mp camera and cant record video scam in plain sight assume this phone uses ovb sensor according to omnivision website the sensor is capable of or at fps fps for and fps for so it is up to the chipsets limitations correct me if am wrong
Huawei,Enjoy 60,really dont see anything to enjoy with this phone based on the specs all the naysayers talking smack about this phone really need ro remove their heads from their backsides huawei with enjoy arent trying to compete with iphone pro max or ultra this is meant to be budget phone at low price there is huge market for large screen phones with decent camera so hd ready screen with camera matching pro max and far superior to all other iphone models will sell its only few years ago people were buying hd ready tvs hd ready was so it was acceptable on giant tvs but not onn small screen give them year or two until theyve sorted out inhouse development for their kirin chips and huawei will be once again the worlds best selling and frankly best phones
Huawei,Enjoy 60,dont think so but maybe like your pfp tho ty lol
Huawei,Enjoy 60,kirin dont think so but maybe like your pfp tho
Huawei,Enjoy 60,chipset limitation kirin
Huawei,Enjoy 60,what should enjoy in this on huge screen euros thats the point ill rather not have phone than to enjoy display
Huawei,Enjoy 60,know this is renamed nova and huawei should have improved on the wifi connectivity and display
Huawei,Enjoy 60,so this is basically huawei nova without the depth sensor apart from that exactly the same phone just another colors
Huawei,Enjoy 60,not to mention inch display with resolution thats gonna look horrendous for really low price id even be okay with on huge display but only if its oled or at least ips tft would look worse than ipsoled
Huawei,Enjoy 60,really like huawei but they dont know how to make entrylevelcheap smartphones this smartphone is very bad
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,cant enjoy these without audio jack
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,ive been using the phone for few days now and it seems like good phone so far although the specs say it has micro sd support unfortunately it does not the other dissapointment is that super device isnt fully supported and you cant access your other devices through the gallery app
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,actually iphone pro max is phone for lol months wont make difference it more yes pro max is indeed phone for but that doesnt change the fact that it wasnt launched in similar story with the iphone
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,yeah naah reviews were published in as well by your logic the iphone pro max is more actually iphone pro max is phone for lol months wont make difference its not phone of that year by your logic samsung is phone of just because they announced it in november but was not for sale until january
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,no huawei refuse to enjoy this phone mean how can enjoy my content with that big notch
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,no no ltea cat no carrier aggrication no google play store no wifi date more there are much bigger issues with this phone than any of these
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,want it now
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,nice photography
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,deleted post sir is everything okay or you just like spamming
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,need this for my daily driver and hope will enjoy using this one
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,be grateful for the battery
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,it is more enjoyable if its amoled
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,that it was released in september does not mean anything the reviews were published in no more yeah naah reviews were published in as well by your logic the iphone pro max is flagship which it isnt and in no way does this make sense
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,end of is in no way that it was released in september does not mean anything the reviews were published in november december and most of the users bought it in
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,tft pls tn ips are all types of lcds exactly and they are all different some are better than others tft being the worst one and ips being the best of them pls is the same as ips one being owned by samsung letter being owned by lg
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,all screens use tft no they do not tft is display technology itself just like ips tn or oled however oled is bit different as thats not even type of lcd
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,there is no good reason to keep that big notch for generations for apple to realize that it more end of is in no way
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,wrong they use ips samsung is the only one remaining that is using tft on their tab unfortunatelly you are wrong as both this phone and the enjoy are still using tft displays and so is for example the galaxy and some other samsung phones but he is even more wrong on many levels so you are good
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,looks very similar to huawei mate pro oh wait no ultrawide camera oh god
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,wooww
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,really love the big size so impressive cant wait to see inches phone soon still enjoy my xiaomi mi max for it big display its shame really that manufacturers stopped making those kinds of affordable big screen mobiles
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,undeniably great phone except the chipset they used
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,gb with bad prossicer and bad screen and mp camera its mp camera
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,the only thing like maybe the size of its screen hopely huawei make larger screen like mate
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,it is from and the fact that apple is still using it has good reason which is face un more there is no good reason to keep that big notch for generations for apple to realize that it was good idea to place the call earpiece in the frame of the screen how many generations will we have to wait to have the proximity sensor in the frame of the screen generations xd and if its from practically because the iphone came out at the end of xd
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,gms nope
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,gms
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,harmonyos is android clone without google services so apps which are not dependent on gms wil more microg walks in
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,this would actually be great for certain use cases if it wasnt for the tft display more all screens use tft
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,notch from that is still using apple lmao it is from and the fact that apple is still using it has good reason which is face unlock this phone doesnt have that this phone has no reason to use notch this big and the fact that apple is still using it isnt an excuse
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,wtf is this ahh notch notch from that is still using apple lmao
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,only for you tft technology is dead but as you have seen it has not disappeared nor did it go more that is very unfortunate because it shouldve its horrible check something like the galaxy and youll see
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,do this phone run every android app with no problem harmonyos is android clone without google services so apps which are not dependent on gms will work fine ones dependent on google services will not work properly
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,tft screen sd big notch and its sold for euros insane
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,any samsung using lcd displays use pls tft instead of ips though some do not all of them pls is much better tho as its basically like ips
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,like the battery and screen size but only these and snapdragon is curse
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,why not lcd wtf this useless screen huawei
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,is kinda slow but we havent ghad mah phone since samsung if skip brands like oukitel energizer etc it is really well worth phone
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,the battery we deserve with this weight lol
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,this is thiccc phone the mah dam thats ruff on huawei phone this thing will last while on heavy use
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,camera setup nope one main crappy cam and second depth sensor not even crappy mp macro evolution
Huawei,Enjoy 60X,id pay good money for mah with flagship specs
Huawei,Enjoy 70,cpu cores are too old
Huawei,Enjoy 70,absolutely electronic junk
Huawei,Enjoy 70,emui was based on aosp theres no emui yet and harmonyos is not based on andro more theres this too httpswwwgizchinacomhowhuaweiplanstokeepandroidappsupportforglobalusers httpswwwsammobilecomnewshuaweisharmonyosnextnotsupportandroidapps httpswwwreuterscomtechnologyhuaweimakesbreakandroidwithnextversionharmonyoscaixin harmonyos next will no longer allow android apps to run no more apk support however international devices will continue running emui and keeping apk support until huawei is sure theyre ready to jump to harmonyos next
Huawei,Enjoy 70,no headphone jack for ill pass thank you
Huawei,Enjoy 70,wouldnt enjoy phone released in with halfdecadeold soc my phone has kirin chipset is still working like new provided that dont use it while its memory is full it can do loss less video zoom and at least of my friends say that it sharp so assume thea should be almost on par with the kirin isnt it not my friend the watts charging is already fast enough in my opinion but still wait for higher screen to body ratio
Huawei,Enjoy 70,can really enjoy it not really this is redmi cpoco level of performance but at this price you can already better xiaomi phones like poco
Huawei,Enjoy 70,yeah all huawei devices and its latest are nailed to android masked by harmonyos to hide more emui was based on aosp theres no emui yet and harmonyos is not based on androidhaving android libraries doesnt mean it is masked android one is using monolithic kernel and other is micro kernel harmonyos is using superior onemicro kernel but people who used both emui and harmonyos on the same device are saying emui is faster but not much to notice if you dont put them near each other and compare them but at the end of day believe what you want
Huawei,Enjoy 70,nm fr thats what thought thats insane
Huawei,Enjoy 70,enjoynt
Huawei,Enjoy 70,nm
Huawei,Enjoy 70,android never dies yeah all huawei devices and its latest are nailed to android masked by harmonyos to hide the oudated android version
Huawei,Enjoy 70,kirin or kirin
Huawei,Enjoy 70,enjoy wont be enjoyed
Huawei,Enjoy 70,id absolutely enjoy it with tft display and such an outdated chipset
Huawei,Enjoy 70X Energy,huawei wheres the nova
Huawei,Enjoy 70X Energy,is this the only phone with snapdragon gen lol
Huawei,Enjoy 70X Energy,come on quick release it here as am waiting and eager to try the harmonyos
Huawei,Enjoy 70X Energy,if it comes with dimensity or uni soc with an ip ip ipk and an lcd display with flat screen then it will be more than worth it if it comes under screen to body ratio of more than no doubt this would definitely be my next primary phone dude
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,ll be waiting for huawei to release the enjoy with an ip ip ipk and an at least mah battery and hopefully an ultrawide like the one on the lite as it can make total of digital zooms which really quite suprise to be sharp clear enough another thing is flat screen also screen to body ratio will choose it over the realme neo and neo se bro
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,also known as huawei nova in global
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,is it true is using actual harmonyosglobal not android hope it will be availa more emui
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,in malaysia is it true is using actual harmonyosglobal not android hope it will be available in my country soon so can try out harmonyosglobal
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,dont know the pricing of this phone and the performance of kirin chipsets but if its more in malaysia
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,the enjoy series peaked with the enjoy and the series after that there hasnt remained much to enjoy
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,literally honor magic lite with the same set of cameras used in the nokia the back from the honor and the front from the honor pro lol
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,hexacore cpu on android phone
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,does it support stereo speakers or single speaker
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,that cpu is so cursed
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,forgot cortex existed huawei maneuvering the us sanctions brings some weird phone specs not seen on any competitors often
Huawei,Enjoy 70X,when the global version goes domestic
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,better find and get an used honor pro than this featureless garbage
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,old processor expensive usdoller
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,is this phone will be available in the philippines soon
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,where do you buy these phoneswhich website can order from am in zambia africa
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,mills feb dead on arrival ewaste first mistake is kirin being used in socs are so powerful morethe kirin is about as powerful as helio gseries chips that should give you an idea of how this phone runs
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,rozatome feb they have optimized harmonyos so good that even the worst phone from them could run it so it moreoptimized software is good but cores
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,how many kirin chips did they make
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,agree this thing is poorly specced for an older used flagship will be miles better than this junk
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,dead on arrival ewaste first mistake is kirin being used in socs are so powerful they can run console level games downscaled to do it right apple the chipset bottlenecks every aspect of the phone the screen resolution is joke the cameras terrible and the speed of the phone abysmal lol im surprised it can run harmonyos out of box
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,flowerplbdcn feb no mi chip is snapdragon mi ses is snapdragon snapdragon is bet morewhich means that the mi indeed shts on it
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,im sorry what euros kirin
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,would be nice if huawei would stick with their cutting edge kirin for another years
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,mihype feb kirin this gotta be joke my xiaomi mi shts on itno mi chip is snapdragon mi ses is snapdragon snapdragon is better than kirin
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,am genuinely suprised they still have in stock
Huawei,Enjoy 70z,kirin this gotta be joke my xiaomi mi shts on it
Huawei,Enjoy 80,according to the situation of samsung and apple are stopping before the too high price of cpu produced by aslms most modern lithography machine but the performance is only better this is causing problems for intel because there are no customers but it is good news for huawei just need to upgrade the nm chip also brings performance
Huawei,Enjoy 80,hey it doesnt matter if it helps beautify the design isnt it and dont forget it is so cheap more this is the beauty of chinese products cater for all its probably better than some iphones out there
Huawei,Enjoy 80,love is temporary but kirin is forever its probably modified kirina cause if remember on its release only max or gb ram with bt but this one gb with bt but still it looks like they are competing with mediatek reusing old socs but with different name atleast huawei is honest by keeping the soc name the same
Huawei,Enjoy 80,gb of storage under youve gotta be kidding me emmc
Huawei,Enjoy 80,fake camera as always hey it doesnt matter if it helps beautify the design isnt it and dont forget it is so cheap with ip and milstd
Huawei,Enjoy 80,sounds promising but dont like the cameras very much
Huawei,Enjoy 80,nobody is going to be able to enjoy this device
Huawei,Enjoy 80,like something like this minimalist design
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,dennisk jun my guys livng in no no
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,thanx god it has no google trap wish all phones stop the cia tout google
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,love it
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,why mediatek my guys livng in

Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,this cant be true surely phone with screen boasting hz refresh rate and more welcome to huawei unfortunately not easily accessible in the us otherwise id purchase this phone in heartbeat
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,higher end mediatek in huawei phone could it be huawei prepares for worse sanctions
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,if only trump didnt have to ban gems on huawei want to buy huawei phone so bad but ala more im pretty sure that you could sideload the google play services and store lot of phones from china come with chinese roms and dont have google support
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,want to know if this phone have this applications voice call google hangout magic voice the lasting hours for the battery
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,good phone
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,great phone huawei
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,have used tens of android devices to find huawei devices show great energy efficiency compared with its rivalries including samsung bet their os is optimized to save power
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,only euros for specs like flagship from years agoimagine if the phone could have google services it would crush any mid range phone from samsung or oppo etc samsung must be very glad with trump
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,estimate price if only usd will definitely buy it again even already have smartphones more have smart phones now im still willing to buy huawei but im waiting for the next generation without the notch but pill shaped
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,why mediatek mediated is fine close enough to snapdragon while being cheaper it doesnt make that much of difference
Huawei,Enjoy Z 5G,huawei launched it today with price tag of
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,how much is the gb in dollars it depends on where you purshase it as of right now amazon doesnt sell it but you can get it on dhgate aliexpress alibaba ebay ect aliexpress its between and alibaba used is between and they only sell in bulk dhgate tends to be little sketchy and unreliable but sells between and of course do your research and find out which is the best option for you dont suggest temu or wish because of all the fake products which will be most listings
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,amazing mobile
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,does it have gorilla glass
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,does this phone really have google service it does not
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,this phone really looks amazing
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,wish there was global version for huawei phones
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,is this just mate pro with less powerful chip and less camera nope this is new iteration of the mate pro with processor of higher clock speeds than the powered mate pro
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,with or without google play services use the vmos emulator app or simply wait for install method with google services they always come month or two after the devices have launched
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,obviously without own huawei mate pro bought from china and is no google plays store but there is amazing app is calling apkpure and with this have fix all my problems with my phone have facebook instagram eveything what need etc
Huawei,Mate 30E Pro 5G,wtf is this
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,where can buy this phone with these specs found it on huawei website but its only more nite this phone hawei mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,gms are working amazing on my mate pro thanks to spanish developer called eloy gomez more couldnt have said it better nokia costs around usd on ebay the same as fe redmi note pro and nord which all have superior high refresh rate oleds wayy faster chipsets and charging
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,thought youd had no problem with in the first place guess you cant admit your more nokia will never make real phones unless they cut their dirty act of endless hz lcds fast charging and so called speedy snapdragon chips it doesnt matter how clean their software is
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,without gms huawei wastes its time sales do not stop falling in europe america thought youd had no problem with in the first place guess you cant admit your own mistake buy nokia buy real phone for change and stop whining with your crippled huawei phone please your hope that the biden administration would cancel the huawei ban turned out to be false hope the new administration even strengthen the ban
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,whats perfect design nothing is perfect
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,ugly phone ever anything else nice to say
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,how to make an ugly phone curved display dual front camera cutout chinforehe more the curved edges are selling point for me
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,precisely and kirin chip itself is amazing vs battery time really never tried better batt more huawei pro with mah battery could last two full days of normal use even the nova can last day with mah of heavy use
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,im curios about petal search quality you can try it yourself but from my experience its fine it does its job
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,outstanding phone for its price
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,also they want to have their own ecosystem like apple and no step back agree it will take quite time to improve their own ecosystem but they will be able to do it as apple did its unbelievable that the president of country can erase company everybodys spying everybody the donald wanted to be the only one really pity
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro 4G,great job huawei this phone is great performance and great stereo speaker this so perfect
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,how did you downgrade you can normally rollback using the huawei hisuite
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the best of huawei for ever
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,on emui but downgrading to emui camera is better how did you downgrade
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,somebody using the phone please share your thoughts about it everything is fine display is great no burn in or green line camera dependent on software version like someone else mentioned every update kill the night photography mine still on emui and everything is excellent but pro still better due to ois owned both and prefer pro for camera usage battery still survived full day of usage with fast charging under hour speaker is decent but this is one of the weakest link for the device apps like youtube waze whatsapp disney works fine with sideload never encountered lag on kirin
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,this phone is really very powerful and provides all the features you need have become depend more how is this phone working in
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,is this phone working fine these days at years age
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,im using chinese rom of mate pro nohan which managed to get hold of after lot of searching and enquiring in the gsmarena specs page both nohlx global rom as well as nohan chinese rom support all sub ghz bands for even phone db httpsshorturlaty suggests that all bands all aforementioned bands are supported however ca combos httpsshorturlatvmwop suggests that chinese rom phone supports only and very confusing can someone with knowledge of this confirm which bands are being supported by nohan
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,is this for real what if update this to harmonyos yep for real every security update that huawei users have been receiving has been killing the lowlight photography capture ability for the uw and telephoto devices atleast thats what have noticed since emui onwards your device needs to be the chinese or the east asian model to get the harmony os nohnx which is the international model will never get the harmony os update do not fall for the hoax news circulated by huaweis own communication team they spread lot of fake news that said the international models is on the end of the road when it comes to os update you will only get security update would rather suggest you get rid of the international model and buy the chinese model that supports hos but note even the chinese model may or may not get future harmony os updates going forward considering huawei has released the mate pro device
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,do not download the octobre update it make the low light photography of the phone on the prima more is this for real what if update this to harmonyos
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,ive just received the october security update do not download the octobre update it make the low light photography of the phone on the primary and periscope camera real bad
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the mate pro received emui right will it be its last update or will it receive emui more emui which region are you from how did you manage to recieve emui and every other user who has the nohnx are on emu based on android
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,switch from poco pro to this beast and dont even regret it despite losing the snapdragon plus gen hz oled screen larger battery and most importantly gms but dont see any large differences between them both and surprisingly mate pro has the same life span as my previous poco pro and also the face id is incredibly fast faster than iphones tbh was an apple user pro max
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,am using huawei mate proit is amazing mobile good display good camera good music sound
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,used some huawei flagships like pro pro and mate pro im huawei fan from using time of pro that time it was the boss phone for camera charging speed music listing huawei best for music lover mate series is best of best specifically mate pro has an amazing design and super curve display it looks so premium huawei mate pro is best
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,last huawei phone with still using it still blazing fast
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,so which is the best for photography go for mate pro or ppro for design esthetic mate pro very good for photography too but not good as series my prefered is matepro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,think huawei is much more polished product hardware and software wise than xiaomi or eve more thanks for your input im currently waiting to see if they release harmonyos next globally and that will make or break my decision whether to switch to them or not and then might even consider newer model mate pura etc really like huawei for their polish and how the software looks but it seems like bit of mess in its current half assed state between android and harmonyos so by waiting for hos nxt will be able to see if theyll pull it together and have the apps optimized for their devices not just randomly ripped apk from somewhere online now obviously dont expect plethora of apps and neither do need lot of them just the popular social media ones and other dailies regarding google which im apparently alone in the world with this thinking absolutely loathe them and their scummy practices and data leeching and spyingtracking and that is the main reason use an iphone and now am considering going to huawei id rather have them milk my data than touch an android or anything bloody google related ever again
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,have the pm currently and lowkey wanna switch to huawei would it be good decision more only if you can live without google services in an official way and are fine using apks for most apps the phones are great overall and the cameras are just the best would recommend
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,my main phone for me right now great in everything the second one is iphone pro max more have the pm currently and lowkey wanna switch to huawei would it be good decision or will it make me go back to apple like xiaoshit did
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why mate pro spec better then pro yain term of camerascreenanyone know camera is definitely better on series or pura series personally the only reason why keep using mate pro is the support battery life also fine for my usage lasts all day
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,you can switch to harmonyos by switching region to hong kong turning the hong kong vpn on and more more details please
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the last great huawei for me good enough performance great battery life good display nice design and finally great cameras they tuned it to perfection with this one and later mates and series phones only tuned it to get high scores in dxo this phones cameras look natural were better than the competition in terms of both software and hardware for the most part especially with the pro but havent seen much reviews of that so can only comment on this and wonder how good that was seriously was tempted to get this phone back in the day nowadays not really because others have better processing at least imo but this phone threw all the fake stuff out for more natural yet still balanced processing especially in comparison to others this phone seriously still has my heart and think if have some spare cash lying around one day ill buy it just for the sake of having it and keeping it as memento of times gone by
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,nope you can this phone miss huawei is bad with updates they like copying in apples foot st more us asians have hos maybe there wasnt any outside china when you made that post which looks silly now
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dont think the international models of the huawei mate pro will ever get the option more you can switch to harmonyos by switching region to hong kong turning the hong kong vpn on and go in my huawei should be harmonyos seitch and tada
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hello does anyone know if the version nohnx received harmony os thank you dont think the international models of the huawei mate pro will ever get the option to switch from emui to harmony os
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,motorola edge or huawei mate pro in fact have both beside iphone pro max both working well
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,has anyone recieved the emui update yet im in germany and sill havent got it hi dear received emui all great
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,how to downgrade to previous version dont downgrade not worth it instead give the huawei ai some time to get hang of things and it will realign with itself have may mpro some time to do so and now its working fine am waiting for emui but from the initial announcement in july about rollout out in september now date of october is floating around and am still on emui based on android think shall ditch this phone for the samsung because huawei never keeps correct time lines when it comes to ota updated for many of their older high end devices huawei should let user the option to unlock bootloader to use custom rom instead but neither is that on offer what bummer
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,this is why downgrade to emui mine low light video recording got shakey for almosf entir more how to downgrade to previous version
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,is this device still worth it in ive used pro before and know exactly how it more nope you can this phone miss huawei is bad with updates they like copying in apples foot steps the only difference is when apples consumer created an uproot about the os slowing down their phones they eventually stop doing thaton the other hand huawi have so small community outside of china that they really dont care about their global users
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,has anybody noticed the drop in lowlight camera performance after the new security update of more this is why downgrade to emui mine low light video recording got shakey for almosf entire frame and it happen while im at emui
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,china can still create kirin chips but only for low end phones but when it comes to high end more yes this is very sad the kirin processors are awesome
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hello mister do find any camera issue with the new emui or maybe picture quality got worse more mine is perfectly fine nothing has changed from the st one owned the phone to today just hope huawei are treat all the fans fairly especially for the fans abroad outside china now am looking for mate pro but unfortunately this phone wont be present in indonesia too bad
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,mine is by the way am from indonesia and am also looking forward to have the more hello mister do find any camera issue with the new emui or maybe picture quality got worse after emui have to downgraded mine to emui because low light video is very shakey for almost the entire frame
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,is the latest system version now mine is by the way am from indonesia and am also looking forward to have the harmony os in my huawei mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,mate pro will get update to android in emui this october is the latest system version now
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,too bad to see the great kirin processor is gone wish huawei brings it back china can still create kirin chips but only for low end phones but when it comes to high end phones well the us jealousness have prevented them to create kirin chips
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,emui is still on android just like the mate pro whit which was released emui isn more mate pro will get update to android in emui this october
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,well mate think your phone has problem many users are now on android emui and soon more emui is still on android just like the mate pro whit which was released emui isnt on android just checked if my device can get android or not and it cant since isnt on android yet with emui neither
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,im more and more convinced that the mate pro is my last phone ive bought from more well mate think your phone has problem many users are now on android emui and soon or later on this year the phone would be on android emui have you ever tried manually installing the new os on that phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,anyone tried to connect there samsung active watch to huawei mate pro veen struggling to do that for how long any advise in tgis mattee
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,anyone here experienced sensor not working after update and reset those sensors are compass ambient light proximity sensor and vibration motor recently bought this to service center they say that this is faulty main boatd but before update my phone has no issue at all
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,they couldve fit all that in pill notch though like this one apparently they didntor couldnt who knows but dont think that notch is deal breaker people need good phone not beautiful phone theres no usefulness in being beautifulbut now im not saying that all phones should be ugly
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,outdated maybe but practical absolutely they used the notch for the face detection they couldve fit all that in pill notch though like this one
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,front is still so much better than the mate pros outdated notch design outdated maybe but practical absolutely they used the notch for the face detection
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,you can try light house lighthouse is working for mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,im struggling to download especially my banking appi struggle with network for both more you can try light house
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,tried everything but nothing has worked out for me guess its only for chinese models you are not the only one too have tried my best to get harmony os but apparently the international model sold by huawei isnt considered mate pro based on the official website that said still enjoy using the phone because huawei is still offer security patches the most recent patch got was for january which is fantabulous considering that many other devices dont get beyond or years of security updates the mate pro is still getting patches
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dynamic island on the iphone pro pro plus is blatant rip off from the mate pro device kind of but not really first it was the samsung galaxy that introduced the pill notch because of the dual front cameras second the dynamic island on the iphone pro is in the center rather than the corner and also is interactable
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,has anybody been able to download harmony os on their global mate pro global models yet more tried everything but nothing has worked out for me guess its only for chinese models
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,do own the phone as matter of fact ive been using huawei since now have the mate more do you mean the skin tone of rear camera or over all plz mine has this weird skintone effect which hate
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,facing an issue of light flares when clicking pic in night also the output of pics is ultra vivid fake punchy colors and bit dark pleasing to eyes but they look so unreal and dark dont know whats wrong with the camera anyone else facing the issue
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,they were my daily driver previously both the mate pro harmonyos and emui versions and more always install custom roms on my phones to remove only google services had pro the built quality is top thank you for this review will try to find pro kirin version otherwise will take the mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,which phone to recommend between mate pro vs pro like the mate more designfi more they were my daily driver previously both the mate pro harmonyos and emui versions and pro kirin if you can get pro the kirin version then get the pro if you can only get the sd pro then youre better off with the mate pro as the sd will burn the pro battery very inefficient compared to the kirin performance for kirin experience and build quality for both phones are similar but the camera and display variable hz are better on the pro mate pro is hz pro is also more manageable for onehanded use due to the more compact dimensions not certain as harmonyos doesnt show the android version anymore but heard that the mate pro is still based on android while pro is based on android were soon heading to android this year not certain if their android version will be updated or not pro also has connection only if thats big deal for you if youre getting the emui version then both cant be sideloaded with gms the microg framework is very handy for the emui version yet the lack of google services framework can be troublesome for some apps depending on your country if your main apps are not relying on the google services framework please disregard this point hope this helps
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hi guys got the huawei mate pro but have been facing some issues with wifi once connect to my wifi few weeks letter it will automatically disconnects and forget the network if search for network cant see my network but other network are available have reset network settings still same issue what maybe the issue
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,and face unlock vs hz and better telephoto for photos would go mate pro for the more thanks mate pro is my favorite will go for it know its two years old but this phone build quality is on another level
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,this versus the mate pro in desgin screen and hardware mate pro wins but in software battery and performance mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hi huawei lovers does anyone know how to change from emui to harmony does anyone have more harmonyos but believe harmony not released for global versions except tablets anyway there no deference between them
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,huawei user since ascend model until now mate pro my current device before this been using mate pro for yearnever facing any problem
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,currently rocking this as my secondary phone alongside the iphone pro as my daily driver also bought an ultra exynos recently got to say that didnt expect the mate pro to still have the best image quality as its gonna be year old device soon did some camera comparisons and the mate pro hands down has the best dynamic range exposure and details even in low light among the three it also has the best ultra wide image quality the camera quality of the ultra pales in comparison to the mate pros
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dont call this useless phone there are many people including me who can live without more correct
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,just my two cents for those who are considering the mate pro in its only worth if you can get it for cheap and you know how to navigate life without google using microg or google in virtual environment etc if neither condition is met and youre not willing to adapt or find it difficult then youre better off getting other phones the kirin is an amazing chipset in better than sd still good chipset in comparable or slightly better than sd but started to get left behind in although the mate pro hardware is still amazing even in and not many smartphones has the same premium built this be mindful though the screen is prone to scratches having screen protector and case are highly advisable not to mention the android version underneath both the emui and harmonyos is stuck in android its likely some apps wont be optimised anymore as were approaching android this year
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hi im want to ask question should buy the mate pro mate pro or the more if you wanted to inject the gms then mate pro or pro make sure the os is emui with mate pro theres no proven way to inject the gms yet if you dont care about the gms then get either the mater pro or the pro kirin personally ive used mate mate pro and mate pro im keeping my mate pro with gms as therere flexibility of getting the apps from the huawei app gallery aurora store apk pure and google play store the emui is getting huawei updates too all things being equal id get the mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,found out that pro doesnt have know that is not for everyone else these more read it somewhere the pro kirin version instead of the sd version is better than the mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,sold my iphone and bought this one the experience is quite fascinating with having no google play services with this device it opened lot of probabilities for me did not know that there are much better neo banks that exist which do not rely on googles framework and there are tons of apps that are alternatives to that of googles mainstream recommendations the only downside that see complication is wear os which was planning to get and no alternatives for now with huawei on that one nevertheless its good phone much better than my iphone in all aspects that lasts more than day of usage camera is superb except for the video which is love or hate situation design wise its unique one and requires case of you dont want the camera bump to be scratched
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,japheth apr youre the one whos failing to use this phone google is working huh
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,say apps youre the one whos failing to use this phone google is working
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,harmony os will only be used in chinese huawei phoneif you want to get harmony os that you ca more my mate pro has emui it looks and behaves just like harmony os no problem with it atm looked it up and it is still based on android though thats kind of bummer seeing as this year we will see the release of android but with all tge regular security patches and how it performs dont mind the android version android since version is already pretty finished nothing new is actually added now
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,guys got this phone and if you want google apps jus head down and down gspace or even more as for apps there are tons of alternative apps which are way better than the original one one such is vanced it replaces youtube app by far its the best alternative app as for maps well can use petal maps or you can download google maps but only thing that holds you back is that you cant sign in as for browser the builtin browser is perfect or can download chrome but again no sign in is allowed if you really want google apps then download gspace or dualspace these apps works flawlessly im using gspace and so far no complaints at all perfecto
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,for what does the people are desperate with google you dont need it for youtube vanced is superior for maps there is petal maps wich is very goodits also for offline use etc etc
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hello thought should do personal review of this phone as ordered it last week and came days ago here are few of my thoughts had this unit for days now and so far so good the google problem doesnt affect me use the app gallery and downloaded the apkpure app store which has everything want and brings regular updades all my necessary apps are on my phone now the battery life seems decent lasts me to days depending on the use use my phone with the max resolution and always hz screen refresh for example charged it to yesterday at and its at today at its obviously not battery champion but it lasts enough and it charges really fast min to full my wife has the iphone pro max and wouldnt change this huawei for that one ever even though the pro max has incredible battery life it charges soooo slowly regarding the design the phone looks and feels incredible had so many people asking me what phone this is ajd complimented it for how fancy and futuristic it looks have the black one and put an orange leather case on it from amazon the combination of orange and black is pure awesomeness ok back to the design regarding the question of the screen curvature it has been pleasure to use with absolutely touch issues can literally hold it any way want and it wont mistouch there is slight green tint at the extreme edges where the glass curves but that is just how physics work not the displays fault but find it adds character and love to use something that breaks out of the ordinary boring phone designs find the colors not as vibrant and saturated as other phones from samsung or xiaomi it tends to look more like the iphones screen with more natural colors that are easy on the eye although when you look at photos or videos they are simply stunning specially when you tilt it and see the curves
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,suffering battery drainage on this phone eish can someone help me
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,without google this is garbage
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,especially iphone users now wonder they dont like anything which is not apple so it comes as surprise to me when they compliment the design
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,interesting opinion people always go crazy when they hold my device especially iphone users more especially iphone users now wonder
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,know that most opinions are on the camera internal specs etc but just have to say the more interesting opinion people always go crazy when they hold my device especially iphone users excellent design by huawei this
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,what about gpay thought it would be obvious that google app service wont work am talking about individual bank apps and apps like curve
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,also at this point you dont need it even bank apps can be downloaded from huaweis more what about gpay
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,you should understand between you have to install it first or it is available from the scratch more also at this point you dont need it even bank apps can be downloaded from huaweis app gallery nowadays
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its the best among the best huawei is legend in manufacturing both in hardware and durability its the best for me dont feel to switch to other brands because huawei has set the trend at the best
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,been using grapheneos for few months no surprised switching to mate pro feel natural
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,first of all google was founded by the cia terra vision was the original google earth stolen from german entrepreneurs my mate pro international version was very easy to setup have previously purchased huawei plus and mate plus chinese version if all you have to comment about side loading google apps then look for an inferior cell phone with google their are many application on the huawei application gallery its time for new and better cellphone huawei is the best choice
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,what ios has google services you should understand between you have to install it first or it is available from the scratch you also can do it with mate pro youre just too lazy to do it there are so many workarounds to install google service into this phone do research
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,deleted post use gspace from app gallery full unlocked version also available from rd party websites all notifications are working perfectly
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,how can install youtube and google apps like gmail just use brave unless you like ads or have the preimium
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,if you have this phone hows gaming in this phone and also the mp ai mode
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yes you can do so via the much more useful app vanced without ads free of charge plus you ca more well thank you
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,well what if the person you are giving wants to watch youtube or google services then you wo more yes you can do so via the much more useful app vanced without ads free of charge plus you can still have gms services through the app called gspace
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,does the huawei mate pro works with in the us yes it works
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,wait for the pro found out that pro doesnt have know that is not for everyone else these days yet only big cities have it since am from indonesia and live in small town believe wont have for quite sometime but my question should keep buy the pro or buy the huawei phone like mate pro any suggestion
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,it doesnt work like that is litle more complicated this is the only reason didnt buy it otherwise this was the perfect phone in fact better than the ss series from samsung its really sad that it doesnt have playstore im using the pro wanted to get this as really wanted to try my hands on the mate
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,can you not install google services apk on this phone it doesnt work like that is litle more complicated
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,fantastic camera quality
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,this is un officially mobile gaming phone from huawei dual stereo bass speaker that can head to head with rog this speaker does not using any specific module so the optimization came from the hardware itself big screen curve big screen as note series and you can use the curve as shoulder button touch sampling rate as is this huawei system it will responsive and compared to hz you wont feel any different colour system management only article in google basically mate pro have self colour management system that adapt colour in apps to optimized it also it does not use srgb gamma so better color range kirin best soc currently on processor it only lose to in sythentic benchmark but it have beter efficiency and thermal output so we can say this is on par in real world case the monster gpu also can head to head with with better temp across the board compared to check benchmark on youtube especially genshin
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,just sold my mate pro after one week of use it has amazing performance and top camera set more after research for apps with problem of notification you can install microg and disable power genie for apps that require google services you can install them first then clone to gspace and it will work for banking apps no choice other than web based browser
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,thats because you never owned the phone so you dont know the camera experience it more amzing
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,cest tres tres mal dus trop why is it that you cannot program experience in user friendly asercoded
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,am so sad hearing huawei wont release mate pro due to short of chipset ive more wait for the pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hi guys need little help im torn between the mate pro and the pro im more the pro has better camera but the mate pro has kirin chip and runs at emui so think go for the mate pro its better for me
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hello markus leto trust me the more storage you can later on compensate with nano sd card whereas the top notch quality for mate pro over ppro you cannot compensate mate pro is far more superior in every aspect you decide regards
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,only liked the night shot photos but was not able to make gmail works so sold it im more available gmail will tech you how to get gmail in huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,to me mate pro is the best camera smartphone ever made not sure why you did not like the more only liked the night shot photos but was not able to make gmail works so sold it im currently not convinced of any camera of any phone so nothing against huawei in particular because huawei updated to the latest software version emui was not able to try the old method to install google service when tried to sell it here in the gulf have very little attention from people to buy the device so ended up losing of its value within less than month to all folks know there are people who are happy with their huwaie devices thats ok but some people are attacking others just because of the expression of their opinion access gsmarena because want to learn about the users experience for certain device and instead see of the comments of people fighting each other and bashing each other the rules are very simple for the forum if person has experience regarding the phone then heshe can put it otherwise no need to turn it into battle yard

Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,was not impressed with the photography of this phone my advice is to try the phone at sho more hahahahaha false info best camera on smartphone mate is king
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,how about huawei mate battery life
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,so do you recommend updating to it coming from my mate pro better try the phone before you purchase it see my other comments below too mate pro has google service so you will lose that if you moved the huawei app gallery is really not up to the required level when you update the app it is not as smooth as google play im waiting for the xiamoi mi or the mi ultra once it comes to be fair the night shot without the night mode is good really one advantage of samsung recently is that the camera detects you are in night mode and asks you if you want to switch to night mode the mate pro has very fast fingerprint sensor and iris scanner better than the samsung alternatively wait for the pro if you like the huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,im very fascinated to this phone feel the only drawback for this phone is waterfall more was not impressed with the photography of this phone my advice is to try the phone at shop or with friend who has it have already sold the phone and moved to ultra after losing of its value the google service was really essential and unfortunately cant live without it hope people dont get offended as im not bashing the phone and rather expressing my opinion of it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,thank you very much for that enlightenment finally decided to upgrade my huawei mate pro more glad to hear that not sure in your region in my region mate pro is about the same price as galaxy ultra was somewhat thinking which of the two to get considering that ive had mate pro from which upgraded to mate pro the money well spent
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,to the comment below hello to answer to both questions below or me mate pro is not worth the money better go to samsung or iphone or xiamoi or if you prefer huwaie then check the pro will try to upload some photos but today sold my mate pro after thats totally biased review not that it is not worth it it worth every penny you give to buy this phone outstanding quality
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hello to answer to both questions below or me mate pro is not worth the money better more thank you very much for that enlightenment finally decided to upgrade my huawei mate pro with mate pro will never get the expensive samsung or apple they are such waste of money for the brand name
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hello is there anyone who has this phone tell me about your experience and say do you satisfied from your device with out google services and finally do you recommend me to buy mate pro thank you for your help
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,thanks appreciate your time to write those and im using the phone and decided not to more so do you recommend updating to it coming from my mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,read all your comments and realized that you are disappointed with huawei and regret what yo more thanks appreciate your time to write those and im using the phone and decided not to sell it and enjoying it agree with you and some other people mentioned that these forums are meant to be giving value and learning experience among the people using the phones instead of having battle of comments of hatred cheers
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,where there
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yes you did where
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,never said we should not trust the people who test these phones stop assuming random sit yes you did
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why would we believe your opinion which is just ordinary and why shouldnt we believe in more never said we should not trust the people who test these phones stop assuming random sit
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,of course there are different opinions and differences in shades or small numbers as percen more agreed with you so no worry the day light photos and the portrait are horrible then hatred is created yes wording extremely strong words drived by anger that causes the main problem in most forums this is why we here to counter that by giving some facts or testimony as polite as possible cheers
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yaochengmdn feb when we are still youth during school we have no objection or could not object on whatever re more of course there are different opinions and differences in shades or small numbers as percentage but when the difference is drastic then it is normal to react to the comment the day light photos and the portrait are horrible it is funny and makes you replicate it is not difference in percentages or shades and here we are talking about phone with superior camera and not childrens toy so dissatisfied personalities are pessimists and they create negative energy around them and hatred is created so look at the bright side of your life this closes further comment on this situation because for me the value is lost and there is no point this comment is not addressed directly to you
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,who said anything about me being an expert lmao why would we believe your opinion which is just ordinary and why shouldnt we believe in the people who deal with it and test devices worth several thousand dollars that ordinary people wouldnt do because of the high value so they exist to help us make the choice easier and give as much information as possible of course its not worth it for those who are stubborn and think they know everything and thats where the story ends
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,scores and ranking are from numbers those numbers are all around us and in all there are numbers they show more or less they show the time that passes with the help of these numbers man rose above all other animals and became the master of our planet thanks to numbers and mathematical calculations climbed to the moon and now there is challenge to go on mars journey of million kilometers these are numbers again without those numbers you would be with intelligence from all other primitive animals and you would not be able to work on pc mobile and other appliances so dont oppose them because its nonsense
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,oh yes you are experthahaha your name or your brand please who said anything about me being an expert lmao
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dude test scores dont mean jack st you have absolutely got it scores and ranking dont mean anything
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,oh yeah and ur telling me that number is going to tell me how good camera is dude test sc more oh yes you are experthahaha your name or your brand please
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dxomark image labs is privately held french engineering and product benchmarking company bas more oh yeah and ur telling me that number is going to tell me how good camera is dude test scores dont mean anything in the real world stop living by numbers
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,mate pro has ultrawide selfie and face unlock so there should front cameras mainuw more main uwa are the same camera module which is at mm main selfie are cropped from it to mm think but still high quality ff camera
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,if you use your phone only for trash apps like instagram facebook etc yeah it had everything more actually the gmail interface from third party email app is better than the gmail app itself and there are web browser that block adds when playing youtube videos so think the default apps are more trash
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,phone have everything that normal user need google is not necessary in somebody life if you use your phone only for trash apps like instagram facebook etc yeah it had everything but if you need to use other apps it lacks lot plus of you that defend huawei are using only trash apps mentioned above and you dont understand that not google itself is the issue its the apps that depends on gms from google only use gmail and youtube
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,sorry if made inappropriate words to you but huawei smartphones with leica optics are more dude test scores dont mean jack st
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,boss any problem with updating apps in huawei planning to buy huawei device such as auto more update apps is no problem if the apps can find in huawei app gallery
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dual space has lot of problems and its definitely not solution tried it on my more phone have everything that normal user need google is not necessary in somebody life
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yaochengmdn jan have seen the result of pro pro and pro because owned them or my wife be more thanks appreciate the reply decided to keep the phone as the reselling price is now half the original price strangely the pro was never like that in terms of depreciation cheers and thanks again
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,you something messed up your comment for the camera is suspicious and indicates that you do more have the phone man have been samsung user all the past years and st time to switch to huawei dont know what shame and suspicion you are talking about im coming to this forum to learn from the people who have the phone and not getting attacked these are corporates and we dont really benefit from being fans for one company over another unless if we have stocks in them and we rarely do
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,thanks for your reply yes own the phone because the phone has miu cannot find the old more have seen the result of pro pro and pro because owned them or my wife believed that you own mate pro and you could not accept the outcome yes mate pro you have is the one that do not have right now surely agreed to you that in good lighting condition most best photography phone are almost equal and the different is mostly on the taste of each owner was from background of mirrored camera and still have bunch of good lenses from nikon at that time there was always big argument on the result between nikon and canon for me the two different groups have different taste of photos do not want to involve nor let down each group there are always an advantages and disadvantages on each side the best way is to look at what we really want from the equipment that we buy each generation will have something that let us down but we do not need to condemn them all the way for the selling price of second hand huawei yes it is very ugly now it is because google is not able to support huawei where most of the user believe that the would not survive without some application that is not provided by ecosystem of huawei it is bad situation for you when you have to leave huawei that is understandable
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,comparing low lights with fe iphone even xiaomi really what do mean by emui more thanks for your reply yes own the phone because the phone has miu cannot find the old methods that worked on to work on the mate the night shot in dark seems ok but the day light photos and the portrait are horrible compared xiaomi as its good value for money but huwaei without the gms supposed to have lower price than samsung thats its not that popular in our region in the gulf offered the phone for sale and got less value of its original price maybe its just me not knowing how to take photos but for sure will not buy huawei again
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,think mate pro has the best phone camera ever
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,you cant even spell huashi so your comments arent good either iphone are not that good either think that the phone is really good
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,if not wrong pro so far no issue to install gms on mine doesnt work anyway am lucky cause finally found someone to sell the phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,if want gms why did buy this phone in the first place gms is not really big deal for me but was not quite happy with the photography only the night shot is good while other shots are below expectation probably dont know how to take shots but will sell it tomorrow to get the ultra my brother has the pro and it takes good portraits if anyone has good feedback would appreciate it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,bro try to think if you is huawei will you lower the price just because of gms huawei get more migrated from samsung sseries to huawei pro few years back then followed by my wife to pro then retired my pro when my wife got pro and now am using pro every of huawei pseries that we owned produce very good photos compared to samsung at the same era challenged my friend with samsung to take photo in difficult lighting condition and samsung is no good of course samsung is playing catchup every year on the technology of camera but is still tailing behind huawei at every generation am very sad when huawei is no longer with google because of trump and his allies
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,just download gspace on app gallery there is no gspace on app gallery and yes mate is good phone but lousy app
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,xperia ii
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,how did sideload gms please share the link or vmos or diskspace using china set or global version
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,and how did you install gms on your mate please you using china set
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,currently im using mate pro export set for quite some time as daily driver and gms more and how did you install gms on your mate please
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why bother with phone without googleso many hassles when for that price you can just buy more would still bother with phone without google would use the tricks from youtube even though it may not be reliable in long term or who knows only if the price was good this device is too expensive even though spec may be good
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,so you want them to make phone with better performance camera battery charging and screen more its subjective as apple brand is more popular even though it isnt better than others yet this device costs higher yeah spec sounds better though not by brand name yet originally moved to android device for better cost effectiveness though android flagship devices are getting more expensive these days
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its good but with the leak will wait huawei mate will be released with nm kirin soc httpswalltracecomhuaweimatewillbereleasedwithnmkirinsoc
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,all ok mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,what dont like with the mate series is that they have adopted the same more you may consider huawei mate
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,am using mate pro excellent phone do not spread rumors aint spreading rumour there were two suppliers one was boe another one was lg phones with lg displays suffered from green screen issue guess yours is boe display mate series is great dont get me wrong im talking about screen supplier
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its not trash it beats all android smart phones in even rog is nothing in front of more there is more to it than benchmarks when will realize that
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,guys check out huawei event light up huawei community tree and win mate pro and many more link httpsconsumerhuaweicomaeencommunitynewyearuserid
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its good phone but kinda defeats the purpose of being cost effective when the price is more so you want them to make phone with better performance camera battery charging and screen for less money
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yeah the camera that doesnt has an ois and mali gpu that still perform really bad https more for my opinion ois is just small tiny part of phone overall mate pro have tons of hardware tech leading ai tech and other advantage huawei made huge upgrade in this phone compare to previous mate series and other brand flagship huawei hardware and quality is trusted and durable thats the reason stick to huawei use apple oppo xiaomi flagship before too never look back after try huawei flagship mate series phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,this trash beats rog hz vs hz oh my with that kirin rog must upgrade asap sn more its not trash it beats all android smart phones in even rog is nothing in front of this phone in benchmark
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,cause there are people like me who care about good camera and battery life and besides no more for me google is one things huawei is my everythings cant without huawei huawei is so good for me not interst in any other phone except huawei phone bought china set and crack in gms settle
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,can you survive without using youtube using the website version that is buggy and using tubem more use yt vanced its better than the regular yt app anyway
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the issue have with huawei the battery capacity is too small but the battery life is still among the best
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,basically huawei mate pro is just the best phone ever it got the fastest hardware best came more yeah the camera that doesnt has an ois and mali gpu that still perform really bad httpsyoutubeeispqsltsa httpsyoutubesxcdvxiyeu
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,have been using mate for almost years no major issue apps are running well just bit skeptical since google play is unavailable
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yes look forward to own this phone soon
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,not huawei hater just xiaomi fan boy stop posting hate comments without owning the phones more approve with you huawei is the besttt
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,cant believe there is still people dump enough to buy huawei phones in this day and ag more basically the huawei mate pro is way better than the xiaomi phones gotta approve on that fastest hardware phone with more than benchmark score best camera in the world basically its the best one even if google is missing theres still petal search and appgallery they can do all the work for you in just one glance
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,apple app store has google apps but where is huawei it should be something like chung store lol
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,when experienced the mate series it balances between gaming and camera so im eager fo more apple app store has google apps but where is huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,liked the most this stuff
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,lg display is the most inferior one instead look at the iphone screen issue also don more am using mate pro excellent phone do not spread rumors
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,well love mine
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,think so limited plus lucky draw between boe samsung or lg screen best is samsung nd best more lg display is the most inferior one instead look at the iphone screen issue also dont forget huawei mate pro green screen issue
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yeah probably if you compare galaxy buds or airpods pro with bottom of the barrel sub wir more good
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,limited stock probably think so limited plus lucky draw between boe samsung or lg screen best is samsung nd best lg rd is boe
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hurrayhuawei will release this beast on at singapore limited stock probably
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,bought it it is awesome
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,uh yes if you want more expensive samsung then you go for ultra not huawei phone this is different series of phone tho so it would go like if want more expensive pro get the mate pro plus
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,and more powerful chip better cameras larger battery faster charging curved display at more never said bout the hardware more design
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,does anyone know good method to install google services in emui and work well at the pres more after days did find any soluthion that work properly without any issue anything in youtube or any other places
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,huawei makes good phones but it becomes difficult to choose them without android hopefully more they still use android just no gms but by next year they will eventually migrate to harmonyos
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,there you go finally you found your phone throw away your crappy xperia and just buy huawe more man am anywhere and sony is costly expensive half baked gimmick as always for same price many and all competitors gives lot more everything and in every aspect better camera more battery moe ram less bloatware ui faster charging speeds more durable cell phone and many else same or lesser price but much more crispy crumbles on top of it thats the main duifference between sony brand and any other android brand
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,rewatche the review ans it seems video and night mode is fine but instead you shouldnt use night mode
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,for steady hands
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,well this is real flagship killer of along with rs edition there you go finally you found your phone throw away your crappy xperia and just buy huawei phone problem solvedno need to dwell in sony phone pages youre welcome
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hopefully and wish by january the new elected president of the usa joseph robinette biden jr will end the ban of googles from huawei because if this will happen strong competitive will arise again huawei will rise up again to the apex agree that my mate after couple of years the battery was blotted think huawei will fix this important issue the battery of mate series after of couple of years it will blotted
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yes you will have to figure out how to root and hack it have an old huawei mate and it was great phone except for two problems battery expanded after couple of years and had to replace it and usb port wore out and it became very hard to charge tried to replace the board but couldnt ever find the exact right one and the usb port problem came back other than that the phone kept going and still works great even after being dropped many times if could find way to reliably charge it would probably keep it im looking for another huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,no ois why
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,whether you agree or disagree or keep silent or shout or cry or whatever huawei makes good devices as compared to other manufacturers in most domains from networking devices to phones to matebooks if you have ever used mate series phones you agree or series phones go to mifi to routers to masts antennas to street cameras everywhere
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,man am real there are plenty of wireless devices which are far better than wired by th more yeah probably if you compare galaxy buds or airpods pro with bottom of the barrel sub wired earphone theres reason why most if not all highend earphone and more still use wires
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,agree on the battery with emui is like with other phones but wait what did you more man am real there are plenty of wireless devices which are far better than wired by the way when you charge your phone every night you can do the same with earplugs and another thing samsung devised few years ago earplugs which can be charged via phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,pretty much the except more expensive uh yes if you want more expensive samsung then you go for ultra not huawei phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,biden is the new president of the us trump lost finally now maybe after he addresses the more totally agree biden selection has been my excitement for huawei hopefully huawei can get lifeline with us technology fingers crossed
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,man since when mah is small no jack is plus wireless audio always better and no goo more agree on the battery with emui is like with other phones but wait what did you say wireless audio is better are you high
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,small battery no audio jack no google services next man since when mah is small no jack is plus wireless audio always better and no google services means less bloatware like facebook instagram twitter etc
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its total waste when compared to other flagship phones just learn how samsung and google ar more no its not is far better than any other flagship on the martket
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,oppo pro is not upto nits mate pro is slightly above nits its only behin more or doesnt it amoled colors hz hdr nits typ nits peak gsmarena xpro review test result oppo find pro max auto whats more have tested myself noteultra and beat it with my find pro with every next update get better and better cam performance on xpro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,qhd on phones is gimmick phone displays are too small to notice difference you cannot spot the difference of qhd and full hd on small smartphone screen have download same clip in hd and fullhd then and my friend cant tell difference between hd and fullhd in screen it start noticeable at screen
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,nickb oct they upgraded everything except the screen that is not smart my eur oppo find pro more oppo pro is not upto nits mate pro is slightly above nits its only behind samsung note ultra and note in ranking mate pro is number understand that huawei need to work on their screen still wonder why they drop screen after mate pro thought they should continue to give us the best bcus price is quit high this time around but again its better for screen to last longer than getting weak after year or more still prefer huawei as far ppi is decent dont care about or just want quality screen that will last longer
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,ofc its different bro bcs they use bit panel instead of bit like others also pro more qhd on phones is gimmick phone displays are too small to notice difference
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,what its true google has experience but huaweis are good too
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,really hope huawei truly upgrades their displays hz display would be awesome for the series the mate pro was good display at resolution
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why do people complaining about missing qhd display resolution mean like this phone just more why because you probably suggest never seen oppo find pro or oneplus pro same panel then you will see the difference it is clear with not professionally armed eye it is day and night difference especially compared to huawei screen even from or even matepro same panel as ppro just bigger
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the display has never been what huawei was best at sadly wish they could make qhd displ more yes correct trust me have qhdhzhdr not hdr like huawei billion color ultra vision tech and other nice display tech in the menus too and it is day and night when compare with ppro essentially matepro has same panel just bigger it is very sad because also love huawei will wait ppro or worst case matepro until then stick to oppo find pro bought it months ago maybe even go for pro when come out april and stick months until matepro hopefully great display on it comming or huge surprise in months from now on ppro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,non of that bothers me have the mate pad pro and it is simply amazing this thing with lac more your point is correct but nonetheless tell you this turn my screen on and turn my wife ppro screen on it is like day and night my oppo is from different universe am sorry huawei but matepro is same panel as ppro just bigger and why oh why you upgraded everything and kept that stid screen panels
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,nickb oct biggest bummer is not the lack of gms but the poor screen even for not mentioning more non of that bothers me have the mate pad pro and it is simply amazing this thing with lack of gms only bothers those that are too lazy to install what they need themselvs have done that and there is no difference now between my pad and samsung phone plus the lack of gms is very good because gms consumes huge amount of battery in standby for nothing and it has hz screen but the quality is very good would buy the mate pro for the super good camera and for looking bit different compared to the rest that look the same except iphone and google this is my personal opinion it has hz its more than enough for me
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,they upgraded everything except the screen that is not smart my eur oppo find pro month old model amoled colors hz hdr nits typ nits peak pixels ppi density eur matepro not even on sale till november oled hdr hz pixels ratio ppi density
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,biggest bummer is not the lack of gms but the poor screen even for not mentioning no qhd no billion colors no hz refresh rate got all of those in my pro and trust me when put it next to my wifes ppro it is like night and day and both phones cost the same including the fact the ppro has no gms that talks lot for mate series too since they have same as ppro screen just bigger
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,if the ultrawide camera sensor is mp then what is the pixel size
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,ok you do know you can add google services after you have bought the phone tutorials are all over youtube dont see the problem
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,would so love to buy this phone if it had google services ty trump go search the net and youtube you can find ways to get around for google owned apps it is not show stopper
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,ofc it is just look at iphone and pixel their hardware is just good but with their own soft more software can only go so far
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,you rly think software is more important than hardware in camera im tired from arguing more ofc it is just look at iphone and pixel their hardware is just good but with their own software they take great photos
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,euro and no ois are you joking huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,xda googlefier app will install gms easily but dont need it hms is enough for me and provided better user experience with the design camera video app etc could install all my applications from huawei appgallery and petal search very happy to have switched to huawei spent more time using the cell after the switch
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the camera all phones use similar sensors from sony or samsung so hardware wise they are al more you rly think software is more important than hardware in camera im tired from arguing with you all you know is what one or two youtubers tell you
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,also your account is the hate comment here whats your point and the biggest differen more the camera all phones use similar sensors from sony or samsung so hardware wise they are almost the same only some software optimizations make the photos look better and the best of them all is gcam and that is an objective statement not preference the pixel has the worst physical camera but with gcam software the photos are fantastic so with better camera the photos are extremely good so not huawei or any other company have the edge when it comes to image proceeding as google does so your argument is stupid and non relevant
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,no google playstore available on these mobiles
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,one can buy new mate pro right now for from the biggest tech store in the eu so mate pro mate pro does mate pro has value of the two mate pro including ssd
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,not sure what you are talking about huawei phones are the best phones ever used it was my more you are very supportive of huawei and its your right you are obviously highly likely to be chinese just my guess cause without playstore and reasonable price the rest of the world dont give dam about huawei sorry
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hhh am not the one going around responding to every one criticizing huawei in this section more youre telling me to look at facts well just you know that im no fanboy the only reason bought the pro is because didnt listen to people like you that dont even try the phones and say they are bad with no reasoning to back them up and rly checked all other the internet what would be the best phone for me to buy and made my choice based of that and not because it was huawei phone in particular
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,deleted post stop being an hater and start looking at facts huawei has some of the best phones out there
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,design is copy of nokia
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,compared to the iphone line models this phone is better in terms of specs and hardware bui more dont know why people keep comparing androidbased phones with iphone based on specs iphone always had lower hardware specs because it simply did not need to go overboard since ios is freaking hugely better optimised than android and no im not an apple fanboy use android its just the way things are
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,if only it didnt have display broken straight outta the factory the hole
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,incredible phone hardware wise its the software concerns that hold many back as long more if your looking for phone the mate could be good all the good features at lower price point but think if huawei made base storage gb the mate pro could be cheaper
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,just because you need google to live your life doesnt mean others do huawei has covere more what
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,were waiting for it to see how it look like
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,this is first time huawei using core kirin was anyway using one year old cores is more cortex gives better optimization power efficient with nm process but not sure would give better result as huawei is very concerned about battery life of their phones
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,no google play services well that sounds uninteresting wait for it to come on sale buy it after you find guide to install google play services profit
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,funny how leica still approves of huawei now that everyone else do not
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,euros and no google services no one will buy it just because you need google to live your life doesnt mean others do huawei has covered of what is missing with good services almost better than googles
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,according to reviews hardware is top notch but all google services are lacking so really diff more kirin completely obliterates all pre existing snapdragon flagships phone has antutu score of while iphone will have score in the range asus rog has score pls post antutu score of iphone so we can see iphone is behind matepro camera is the best found on any smartphone completely destroys iphone cameras except for night photography where its not that good selfie camera is also top notch night photography on matepro got no competition let me see phone with better night photo
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,google knows too much about you already it builds profile based on your searches youtube views email and even your location history no gms should really be viewed as clean break
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why it has camera holes while it has only cameras one camera is tof module
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,actuallyfrom huaweis consumer global site they dont list ois in the main sensor maybe but the result is good
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,wonder how come this pro model that is already expensive camera less than the pro model dont have ois on main camera compare to its predecessor totally not acceptable
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,huawei is so desperate right now
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,whoever you arewhatever you likebut you must respect the huaweii can imagine with google se more totally agreed been using the phone for days so far so good
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,it has ois see review or other websites actuallyfrom huaweis consumer global site they dont list ois in the main sensor
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,delusional statement got any complaints for iphone or any criticism for the phones
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,relying to much on google would be catastrophic imagine if other devices were to be denied google with cloud based apps you can pretty get much out of the services without the actual app taking up space in the device and depending on the region can you get the best out of google
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dont worry about the price thats for gigs of storage theres still gb storage option hopefully we will soon know that price
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,think with no google play services is good thing less spying on my data definitely getting one as for apps clone them from my old spying android phone with spying google and transfer apks simple only apps that wont work are those that depends on google play services but yea fk that good spy free phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why no ois on main sennsor even dxo states that pro with same module but with ois pro more it has ois see review or other websites
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its sad huawei has not launched pro in india waited too longexcept samsung not even any more dxo is sponsored by huawei and other brands that is cheap as it look at the video quality on iphone and compare it with others clearly iphone is the leader but dxo gave it maximum same as others with much worse even of video quality
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,please can someone help me out here how does any phone function without google just want to know
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,battery is not bad much more than apple pro huawei water resistance and screen is trash camera too
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,believe it has optical image stabilization ois on the main lens too
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,can not understand why huawei put such small battery tragic focus on the battery life not battery capacity
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,results is what matters huawei has good battery life from the past the nm will maybe make more battery is not bad much more than apple pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the us bans are simply solar eclipse it will be over and they will overcome it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,thats actually bit bigger than average actually its not small at all unless youre used to user the energizer pk brick of phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,summing everything up keep with my current mate pro with gms installed on it there are not many reasons that make me change my phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,where is gb gb then dont like
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why american want huawei to close up or because of selfish interests or political httpswwwcnbccomampustriestogethuaweiblockedfrombrazilsgnetworkshtml
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,it would be awesome if it has stereo speaker agree hopefully
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,im really excited hope you have stereo audio and excellent screen with great video camera already with that chipset buy it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,best huawei phone cant wait
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,should have android the drawback new phones old os
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,delusional statement no need to be triggered if you dont like the phone buy yourself an iphone or samsung exynos cpu
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,missing dual stereo speakers for flagship phone thats because it hides the earpiece under the screen google have followed with the pixel the had it earlier in the year too samsung will most likely also do it soon
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its amazing phone huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,is no one noticing that it could record at fps the ultra records it at fps so we more it would be awesome if it has stereo speaker
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,yeah broooo im agree with for your opinion missing dual stereo speakers for flagship phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,its really flagship better than samsung note ultra better than iphone pro max delusional statement
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,stereo speakers am hoping for the same as well dual speakers
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,came out on the mate pro really didnt know remember when first found out about fps this is really insane
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,huawei shes monster by phones the huawei mate pro better than iphone series
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,super good and excellent phone high profile low price huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,hmmm the camera spec looks identical to the pro except for the smaller mp ultrawide camera and video recording but the new kirin is definitely the one to eye for really want to see how the new chipsets isp fairs up with the current mp main camera sensor
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,gb rate confirm
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,fps thats slowed down wow im really suprised came out on the mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,super excited for this even though it wont have google play service it will still be the best phone for me and entering gonna wait to this than thatiphone ish from apple that looks like iphone but more expensive and offensive for consumers
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the mate pro is still massive and was impressed to see the uk pm preferring it over the iphone definitely the mate pro still rules have and pretty happy about it wouldnt swap it for any samsung neither any rubbish apple
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,what are you trying to say plz use comas and question marks tsap the phone is good but how much is it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,wow dissapointed the mate pro was real step up with new technology now there just rea more the mate pro is still massive and was impressed to see the uk pm preferring it over the iphone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,please huawei do you really need to add depth camera for selfies more secure face unlock and better selfies hold on that sounds like apple but at least huawei could fit it in holepunch
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,innovation king huawei took the breath away of all the companies and finally boycotted it no they did not this is nowhere near good phone for the money it has terrible mali gpu and only as display while competitors have at the same hz ie oneplus pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,still not so power than mate pro as ppi density less then mate pro camera front less more what are you trying to say plz use comas and question marks
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,wont work with andoid auto
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,this is an ultimate high end from huawei always surprising other phones mali gmp ghz processor while ive always seen ghzbut we need mah
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,saw something on the top bezel is the traditional earpiece back
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,what kirin are serious
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,why not cortexa ask tramp
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,we are in the clock game now yesss
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,like camera design refreshing look
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,know no one can match its camera system
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,honestly really dont like curved screen mate is having good screen big enough wonder what is the use of the curve screen fashionable elegant look even am not iphone user but really salute apple manufacturer with no curved screen product so far thinking of switching to iphone if no choices
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,eh huawei guys are supper creative mark my words other brands are soon gonna copy the camera set up nice work huawei but they should begin including the offline fm radio
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,well thats very ugly design hope its just rumor other than that feel lik more its like if the mate pros design was inverted but dig it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,wow donut shape camera island think nokia use it first at nokia never mind but hope the waste space in the middle can be use for anything else like gimbal camera ala vivo pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,waiti thought the mate pro was adopting the mate stereo speakers system they are
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,all is ok but why huwaei always dont provide stereo speakers
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,nm seriously
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,ok huawei is doing something right and that is the resolution custom hd is very needed for inch or bigger screens really why does no one else do this
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,we should find way to deactivate the edges and make it like flat screen
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,if the specs are true the screen size looks right for me camera setup is great wish it had larger battery flat screen
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,ugly long notch no mm jack grheavy nanomemory sim goodbye
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,ugh again with the hideous hole in the display
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,and theyre also done with this mp ultrawide do gsmarena even think before believing these sources
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,idk where gsmarena gets their info from but its off mate pro mate pro mate rs porsche design and maybe
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,kirin latest soc is still in cortex same on huawei this is first time huawei using core kirin was anyway using one year old cores is cheaper they used mali which is latest gpu
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,dimensity is far better then any of the kirin soc etc dimensity in performance is on par with kirin
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,again the old cores only kirin had latest cores in even mediatek blew them out of the water doesnt matter we have reached point where cpu as so fast the difference in day to day use is insignificant instead huawei focused on getting the best gpu as fastest ram they could game graphics keep improving so thats what huawei needs to focus on better gpu performance so they have fastest gpu mali
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,glimmer oct jesus hope these arent final renders those bezels are like from chineese knockoffs more without bezels you would always touch your phone nothing to hold on to horrible and lot of accidental touches what is wrong with you without bezels phones look boring and the same
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,welcome mate seriesshine onkirin and camera breaks all rivals kirin latest soc is still in cortex same on huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the back of this phone be looking like an ipod without the screen
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,way too big
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,oh my dont really like capsule punch holes notches any interupted displayslooks primitive for me
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,jesus hope these arent final renders those bezels are like from chineese knockoffs so terrible
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,as far as know the back of the phone will look completely different the one we see here looks good what do not like is the dual front facing cameras too much black on that nice huge screen
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,already arm released last architecture of cortex that is cortex but still kirin is in more mate series arent launched yet
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,the back design looks like nokia and
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,huawei series again already arm released last architecture of cortex that is cortex but still kirin is in cortex which is already shine in snapdragon and exynos soc huawei we are already upset on your making
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,am the first fan
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro,low battery against the older models since it now needs to feed and seed on antennas it should be at least mah the older ones on only antennas was about the same mah
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,just see what it had first ultra band with sfs beta which is faster than the ufs an more true they have wifi available in mate pro but theres no avail on the other flagships today and their is much better than todays phones sheesh
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this phone is very very good and also very very rare
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,but how to install google apps in this phone and if somehow installed will they work all the apps dont need google play service to run on an android device try downloading apps from fdroid aurora store theyll work very well with degoogled phones too
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this mate pro plus with gb ram is still far better than mate pro both in design and and features and also the looks the camara ring of mate series is prettier than that of mate series like curved screens on mate series screen to body ratio is better than on mate series the front camera design on mate series is better than that of mate pro series except for mate plain its
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,it works but notifications will be delayed when using gmail and other apps that use google more does it support google services or have to use rd party
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this has always eben my dream phone unfortunately it is very rare and the price doesnt more same here my dream phones are fold and dis or mate pro but they are all above dollars brand new
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,you can always install additionaly google play service but how to install google apps in this phone and if somehow installed will they work
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,still nobody can beat sfs in this phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this phone has some impressive specs for sure definitely solid enough to beat the ultra more you can always install additionaly google play service
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this is still the best phone in the market even after full year
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,where to buy this can buy it in my coyntrycroatia starting with gb variantyea the number is limited and sold very qukly when they come un shops
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,im intrested with this model but where can buy this you can simply buy this from carphone warehouse were running in promotion and you can simply buy this mobile phone in very cheap price
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,oh this is super cool
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,intrest this phone but not buy this phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,almost perfect phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,till this day this is the only phone that ticks most of the features im looking for phone except the now outranked camera rating but still my top choice my only problem with this phone aside from the lack of gms is cant find and buy this anywhere in my country
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,love the phone but can see it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if love huawei phones like me got to buy this phone cause they huawei cant release anoth more where buy
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the camera array at the back looks like an aliens face
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,bought mine from tradingshenzen last month im from finland myself and shipment was fa more no tulli guys holding the phone hostage for taxation
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,anyone knows where to buy it from for the states you can check it in walmart
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,fairy cheap
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,you guys seem to say its too expensive but this is china only remember not globally available
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if this phone would be cheaper and front cameras would be in the middle of the screen not on the left or right edge then yeah definitely would buy it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the more copper cooling used the better for keeping heat down dont blame mali but the more this is very powerful with right cooling and optimisations since its mali it woukd been significant faster than exynos snapdragon and
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,got mali mp cores gflops up from gflops standard ps was more the more copper cooling used the better for keeping heat down dont blame mali but the oems who refuse to spend because copper cooling is expensive
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,huawei is pretty much overcharging just like apple they overpriced their phones so much that more look at its porsche design so much higher price than next model
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,dude the vanilla mate is what makes them worth that much huawei is pretty much overcharging just like apple they overpriced their phones so much that they pretty are in their own league already look at the mate
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,dont care about gmsthis phone is amazing and worth the price
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,please bring back gs on huawei great phones but missed opportunities
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,needs mali gmp got mali mp cores gflops up from gflops standard ps was gflops snapdragon tops out but sustained is higher but all about sustained performance dont think this gpu can stay sustained for more than min and bad optimisation from mali
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,fk gms the more tantalizing question is when will this be released in the philippines and other markets this is the only phone so far the meets what need like great all around camera and exceptional performance except for the lack of gms really ugggh ive been waiting since yr ago only to be disappointed by the lack of variant color for the pro and now the mate pro to which seemingly wont be released here
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,an amazing phone with amazing specs but it is sad that they dont have google services why do you need somebody to spy on you
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,yes it is very interesting rumor they were supposed to use it for the line but thin more im guessing that the liquid lenses is from the norwegian company polight they are hiring people and ramping up production of there tlens the tlens better than the traditional vcm and is possibly going to replace it in the entire industry polightcom
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hey arent there rumors that they are going to use some liquid in the camera in the ne more yes it is very interesting rumor they were supposed to use it for the line but think it will stay for mate liquid lenses are supposed to be solution of liquids suppose ionized and due to the passage of current they can focus blur darken the shot or lighten it all that in milliseconds it is assumed that they will have much greater capacity to zoom and they will occupy less space they will have greater dynamic range and they will be more resistant since they will not use motors and they will be able to change the disposition of the lens with the current but they will not have improvements in the picture apart from the dynamic range or they say httpsyoutubetoeyxavtigw sample of how it will work know vanilla is ufs but mention sfs to say why the difference in cost between vanilla and the pro and the pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the ceramic body the mm periscope and sfs must also be quite expensive as it is more hey arent there rumors that they are going to use some liquid in the camera in the next matep that could potentially match the focus time as the naked eye oh and the vanilla one has ufs not sfs
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the apple iphone will get much more powerful ultrawideangle camera that the ultrawideangle camera of all four iphone models will receive massive upgrade namely in the form of much more powerful lens that could improve the image quality in low light by because the ultrawideangle camera should have lens with an aperture of instead of just for the jump from to corresponds to almost complete aperture so that the lens could capture almost twice as much light in practice this means above all that in low ambient light significantly more detailed lowernoise images should be possible mm
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,im going to have heart attack and im not selling my heart to get thi more dude the vanilla mate is what makes them worth that much
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,mate pro is extreme expensive self also price difference is huge with pro and pro plus more they only made limited number of the mate pro and its only limited to china its probably because they dont have lot of kirin chips because of the us ban
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,what is sfs technology sfs is like ufs they measure how fast the write and read of data is but in some test it was times faster then ufs ufs average sequential read speed is around mb sequential write speed is around mb and random write speed is around mb during testing huawei mate pro found that the phones sequential read speed is mb the sequential write speed is mb the random read speed is mb and the random write speed is mb
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,iamjoshuabcxvii jan btw is the ultrawide camera of this phone capable of macro photography yeah its capable doing that
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,does this have virtual lr like my mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,well you same color black and white huawei mate pro or huawei pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,is it difficult to get all the apps that you needed in huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,btw is the ultrawide camera of this phone capable of macro photography
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,anyone want play store just need to download the dualspace app latest version and the app store is there
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,up until now cant buy this phone in the philippines daheck
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,well there are plenty of problems as you dont get google services for most people that more price maybe major constrain but it worth it on google yeah perhaps youre more to the service but it better you work through your device it makes you better performer as advance user
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,camerawise who has better camera mate pro or ppro same camera
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,and you think hasnt done that already
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,euro very brave price you buy if you going to use it as compact camera otherwise extreme expensive toy
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the spec king with the most visually disgusting os
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,go ahead with your purchase and you wont regret it on paper and the tested hands it pro more well there are plenty of problems as you dont get google services for most people thats big inconvenience even if you can work your way around and the price is not very attractive either on top of that you need to buy it upfront whit out contract so for rich chines or techsavvy fans boys maybe
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,huawei harmony os is not supported huawei mate and huawei support harmony os and android in dual operating system will be available
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,want to do on line chopping or just want to buy this huawei mate pro but but don more go ahead with your purchase and you wont regret it on paper and the tested hands it proven extremely excellent with their reviews have pro and no bugs or draw backs it runs fluidly and to my surprise when cloned from my honor of google services worked and still working well with exception of google maps and play store
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,when is available dual operating system from huawei smartphone and mate harmonyos is based on android framework
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,still no review come on dxomark has already released theirs
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,pretty sure that every phone manufacturer has the capability to monitor phone users if it want more you dont understand the power of big data and how your info its managed its not about the individual data by itself its the collective tendencies and lines of thought yet with few simple word filters they can make detailed profile about you who you are and how you think
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,just remind you this phone have no google play if you use this mobile in china that is amazing google play works on this phone here in europe can dowload it try it its just works
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,why do you care so much an american phone definitely doesnt spy and any device at all more pretty sure that every phone manufacturer has the capability to monitor phone users if it wants the thing would be why would they bother you and of the population of the planet are likely not sufficiently interesting enough to warrant someone looking at you or me most likely you and are just paranoid and possibly little self important no offence meant or intended after all who wants to know what mrs blue is having for dinner oh yes forgot that is facebooklet or instagroomlet possibly there is an app for that the only way to not be watched these days is to live in cave with no connection to the grid
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,too expensive would go for though doesnt have google either dont like google much but its still more convenient to have it than not having yes there may be some trick to install gms like seen in youtube though unreliable
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hello everyone may know is there anyone using mate pro ive been usi more just remind you this phone have no google play if you use this mobile in china that is amazing
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,who buys phone that can not be update nowadays spending in buying something that is not completes is nonsense
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the greatest chinese phone so far
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,qualcomm also uses an eightcore architecture for the sd new single prime core is responsible for power peaks namely the arm cortexx which clocks at ghz this is supported by three powerful cortexa cores with ghz clock and four cortex cores with ghz in the energysaving cluster for the memory smartphone manufacturers can choose between lpddrx ram or the newer lpddr ram maximum of gb is supported in each case wifi to gbps bluetooth with and two modes bandsmmwave sub ghz but should also save the battery in the best case scenario the new processor has downstream of gbits and gbits in the upstream second lead processor qualcomm snapdragon the world record no one first lead high end processor in the world is huawei kirin soc
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the phone is superb and will go for it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,am surprised that the internal storage is only gb to leica
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if you buy in china it is like cheaper so am excited to buy this at its price here from which site in china taobao
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,also have senzorslens in notch not plus plus comes with front camera depth sensor thats all comes with front camera depth sensor tof and mate pro plus comes with additional face unlock sensor including the other sensor and infrared for face unlock
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,where is the mate want also mate have mate evrl loooove it very much
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,check on youtube install google play services on huawei phones did while ago with my huawei media pad works perfect no issues got few updates and yesterday another update love it no return to sams
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,amazing phone with outstanding performance and quality also this phone has huge battery size too bad cant afford it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,my favorite phone from huawei yet however cutout is smaller than this who would be able to handle inch display easily its to large although its hardware is impressive than last years mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,have you took look at the pill notch on the its much smaller than this not more also have senzorslens in notch
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the selfie camera ultra wide is great though for those who want to vlog and worth the added more have you took look at the pill notch on the its much smaller than this not saying the pill notch is bad but this is not the best pill ive seen
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,not only ios the design inspirational but has lots of practical function to it for one you more in china the xiaomi mi ultra exists too what do you think about that phone believe the ultras camera is still slightly ahead the screen is better with higher refresh rate and hdr it has google services if you configure it yourself the only thing the mate pro has is nm chip oh yes and optical zoom too that one is cool
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,yes we should let the ccp spy on everyone just so consoomers can get their fones why do you care so much an american phone definitely doesnt spy and any device at all that comes from china is spying device sounds suspiciously like racism and yes personally take offense from your statement it hurts the feelings of many people beware of what you say
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,as developer ill not bound other peoples to not purchase it due to gms hms is rapidly more what apps have you programmed so far
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,ugliest design ever made by huawei and im wondering hows this phone get this high rate reall more not only ios the design inspirational but has lots of practical function to it for one youre hand wont cover the camera when holding it or finger print it up when gaming its also centered the caameras and can actually balance well when you set it down intead of rocking around like previous phone designs to tell the truth though am eyeing the rs porsche design its actually quite affordable here in china
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,that pill notch is just way too big personally would be very bothered by that if had to more the selfie camera ultra wide is great though for those who want to vlog and worth the added space besides just look at iphones which is like times the size
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,pro or nokia prefer the pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,but at the end of the day you would probably rather have snapdragon without in the huawei pro if qualcomm will offer something like that than no chip at all huawei and qualcomm have not yet commented on this news not supported google play store not supported snapdragon clock speed ghz kirin clock speed ghz exynos clock speed ghz dual operating systems as at smartphone android harmony huawei own speed charge watts
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,biden please restore huaweis privelage to be able to work with us companies at least more yes we should let the ccp spy on everyone just so consoomers can get their fones
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hopefully bidens choice will be good for the world as well as for huawei
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,mah the phone would have to be mm thick and have screen to fit that behemou more actually think every flagship in should have mah battery ive seen lot of reports that say mate has battery durability similar to note which is not great for phones of this price range and quality for average user it can last day but for advanced and more demanding users hardly next year well have bigger batteries on all flagships due to high refresh rate on all
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,it just might happen now that biden has been elected but it wont be an over night thing more yes know it wont be within few weeks after his inauguration it may be for couple of months before he does or not at all but if theres one thing the us elections brought is huawei may be more likely to have its ban remove than with trump if he had won mean biden may not remove it really but its better of bet and chance that it more so possible with biden than with trump this phone for all its great hardware camera and emui features is lovely but the lack of gms is really bummer the gms hackworkaround out there isnt just stable yet so having gms on this phone in the coming months would make it one of the best if not the best android phones out there for me
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if it would be sony with you will tell us its brick but its mate pro more asked you question alex back in october that youve yet to answer
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,such an excellent hardware but its very sad there is no google play grab your popcorn bro from next january there would be world free markets because the bully in white house must have gone for good also huawei may have better offer of harmony os
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,iamjoshuabcxvii nov now that biden seems likely to win the us elections as hoped hopefully the entity ban on hu more it just might happen now that biden has been elected but it wont be an over night thing itll probably take weeks if not months for this to change huawei really pushed things hard and made tough competitor really miss their global presence regardless of what people think of chinese phone makers
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,now that biden seems likely to win the us elections as hoped hopefully the entity ban on huawei would be remove soon after he is sworn into presidency such an absurd way to kill competition and good innovator really im somehow ticking off the lack of gms in this phone alright however im curious to see how the mm ultrawide camera of this phone will work and how good it is to be considered good considred enough to splurged the extra hundred dollars over the pro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,httpsmgsmarenacomheresaneasymethodtoinstallthegoogleplaystoreonyourhuaweiph more just installing these components does not compesate for the loss af some useful apps for many many important apps require the google signature or certfication to run
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,to be honest think portion of the price comes from inhouse sfs storage its faster than ufs though
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,so far so great looks awesome but cant say same about the pricing without google services
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,dear can you please explain me how can install google store it will be will be big help more httpsmgsmarenacomheresaneasymethodtoinstallthegoogleplaystoreonyourhuaweiphonenewsphp if that doesnt work httpshuaweiadvicescomdownloadinstallgoogleplaystoreonhuawei hope this helps
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,yes its possible but because this phone is not google certified phone then expect so more dear can you please explain me how can install google store it will be will be big help for me thanks
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,video should have this kind of price where would you watch video most peoples use only and monitors and mobile phones on or monitor is useless to watch or videothere is no difference it will be same quality
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,dears can we install google store ourselves can any one explain me thanks yes its possible but because this phone is not google certified phone then expect some limitations widevine drm will still be restricted to try checking tradingshenzhens website for more info
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,huawei mate pro watts high end charge fast charging mah okay coming soon
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the snapdragon will be qualcomms first soc to employ the nm manufacturing process it is expected to have one cortexx core three cortexa cores and four cortexa cores the chip will reportedly be manufactured by samsung clock speed ghz wifi ad ax and up to gbit in the downlink hisilicon removed the mmwave function for the soc integration from the standalone balong and restricted the sub ghz spectrum to mhz bandwidth with gbit in the downlink the as yet nameless new balong modem remains at sub ghz but creates bandwidth of mhz at theoretically up to gbit in the downlink if the network allows it
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,install it yourself dears can we install google store ourselves can any one explain me thanks
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,protection
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,no google play services install it yourself
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,very expensive mobile and also not included radio technology and also battery is mah is more mah the phone would have to be mm thick and have screen to fit that behemouth as well as the other components in the phone mah is more than enough especially with the nm fabrication process which is more power efficient
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,im waiting for huawi pro plus in
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if you check the global site for huawei think you guys are only getting the pro and porsche more yes porsche is the but it is eur see mate rs matepro porsche is still eur and its year old lol lets hope after new year huawei will bring the to europe too just like ppro came much time after ppro
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,have asked local huawei center they said no official info for matepro comming to europe yet by december they will know come on huawei do not want cn version come on do international or at least european model
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,deleted post uhhhh great another one of these seppos
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if it didnt have the worst punch hole of all time think that it would have been the more how do you want it to look when it has face id
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,no google play bad phone bad comment just because it has no gms doesnt mean its bad phone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if you think is brick then you need to hit the gym dont worry about me man workout for decades regularly but phone this thick and heavy has tendency to lay terrible in hand say this because held and ppro thats just fact and wish they changed design little bit because of this
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,actually it is refreshing to have phone without google ecosystem on it you can check gmail more totally disagree
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this phone is brick like nowadays were gonna need backpack to carry phone more if you think is brick then you need to hit the gym
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,noob question what the difference between telephoto lens and periscope lens just the zoom level periscope lens uses reflection across multiple lens to get the desired zoom
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,too bad it has curved display wouldve considered it otherwise
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,why only nopan this looks like cn only did huawei confirm the comming to europe like the pronot interested in it for me
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,omg grsheavy ugly long selfie cam no micro sd no mmjack no thanks
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,and what if harmony os falls in to the same ways as google android and ios you still going more its just not about just supporting one os as you point harmony its all about diversity options and opportunities for consumersusers especially for us developers we can share our expertise not just to two platforms the more the merrier
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hello two front camera that terribleno thanks if you are vlogger the ultrawide is bomb and much appreciated
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,totally agree with you mate its winwin for the consumers and us developers for new fres more and what if harmony os falls in to the same ways as google android and ios you still going to support them or look for another os
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if theres only google play store ill buy this in heart beat this is way prem more go get it then httpswwwgizchinacomcdnampprojectorgvswwwgizchinacomgooglefieraneweasywaytoinstallgmsonhuaweidevicesampampjsvaampgsausqpmqaqfkagwasadaohreferrerhttpsaffwwwgooglecomamptffrasampsharehttpsaffwwwgizchinacomffffgooglefieraneweasywaytoinstallgmsonhuaweidevicesf
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,theres an aptoid instead of googleplay lol not great idea
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,only hdr why not hdr
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,im eyeing for this phone superb camera oled and nm chip and infrared thanks huawei more high demand and low supply higher price
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,how sure are you lets revisit this chat in months only they will be sold out in he more of course but mostly in china since only around million chips where made sadly huawei can not be hit anymore because of the ban
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,think you didnt do any research mate slightly better cameras well youre more funny new phones battery life is mostly determined by the screen on time this has bigger resolution so even if the cpugpu use less power the screen eats all that buy the phones compare them and see if there is really any difference
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the best phone you cant buy sadly
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hope this ban on huawei ends soon so we can buy such great phone with gms salam babak you can install it though
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,huawei is best no play store no problem every app need working on my huawei mate pro whatsapp facebook messenger every app working gmail working absolutely fine with huawei email app huawei is best petal search is great bought mate pro from aliexpress weeks back
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,lets appreciate the huawei mate series for what it brings to the table most commenters here more you are right good phone huawei mate series
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,personally find it rather odd that the main camera for this particular mate variant would have ois whereas the pro and the vanilla one doesnt quite ballsy move right there
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this phone knight without sword
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,nice phone exept its brick and after years using different phones im done with heavy phones for me is optimal and hope withing yesars theyll learn how to shave the extra and keep the premium features
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,so bigger sizes nothing special about the battery nor camera slightly better processor and more think you didnt do any research mate slightly better cameras well youre in for rough ride slightly better chipset again youre in for rough ride this nm chip smashed the asus rog phone with sd battery life here is amazing too thanks to the nm chip all in all this is far better phone than the mate pro you definitely didnt do your homework all you did was glance at the spec sheet
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,was looking forward to buying this phone but might not be the case anymore what is it with the over curved screen edges same large selfie cut out same boring memory capacity both internal and memory card
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,front camera length ugly hate this this style and curved display
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hate curved display it must flat display
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,mi ultra is better option
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,huawei allcurved design consumers wow beautiful apple iphone new design consume more it also got no jack and nobody care
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,think this will phone will sell only in and around china they gotta fix this gms thing if more they still competing even without gms and they can still get the desire and satisfactory of some peopke
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,this baby guess is piece of art wish it had google services am note ultra user looking at the market now plus camera is without doubt is the best of the best thanks google
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,without google this phone will be flop
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,if you look at the raw numbers the kirin has more transistors cores and higher clock speed than apples if only google play was supported than this could be very competitive to the iphone
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,look high spec but no service google like life is nothing best on camera built high cipset for what gaming hz refresh rate curve screen oled out
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,would like to lose or gb ram to increase the battery size
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hello sir am sure you felt offended by my post since you seem to be huawei fanboy but more im sorry to say but snapdragon is better than kirin on papers only camera processing is better in kirin even gaming optimization is better than snapdragon snapdragon has still heating issue and not that super snappy unlike kirin in kirin it sustains your fps during gaming
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,omg its like seriously good like it takes mobile pics and stuff cant wait to get this tall glass ipod looking thing show off to all my friends like yeah
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,my next device period
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,all curved display hate curve
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,kirin inferior to snapdragon proof sir you used the mate pro before nope more hello sir am sure you felt offended by my post since you seem to be huawei fanboy but to answer your question about kirin yes it is inferior to snapdragon not necessarily since it is nm and the new kirin is nm but when snapdragon is out with the same nm class the kirin will look like joke since it was the case from the starts many years ago and please feel free to check what say through all kirin vs snapdragon versions of course by respecting the processors equivalent generations also the only argument you could take from all of my answer was the new kirin all other things didnt matter yeah please keep your fanboyism to yourself and dont call people haters just cause they are speaking real facts have nice day
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,only idiots would buy this phone please just compare it to poco pro and see for your sel more kirin inferior to snapdragon
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,the best of the best it is pity that is victim of google hope that changes soon
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,malig with cores enabled now that is how you maximize the mali gpu samsung dont like chinese brands of phones that much but dont you dare give us anything less that samsung
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,with these prices and no gms think huawei is overestimating their command of market these more this phone seems like much better alternative to the ultra or note ultra for what youre getting its very aggressively priced but its still very expensive too bad the us hates huawei and took google services
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,hope price is out of season april fools joke pro should be priced around more it is so much more phone than euros can buy if you think that then su should be euro phone not one
Huawei,Mate 40 Pro+,it has not qhd screen resolution low battery sorry ppi is enough for anyone even if you go pixel peeping
Huawei,Mate 40,does it supports fm radio unfortunately no it doesnt only mate has offline fm radio functionality
Huawei,Mate 40,hello please from where can buy this mobile it looks nice thank you very much you can buy it from trading shenzen look it up
Huawei,Mate 40,thought this smartphone had dimensity processor
Huawei,Mate 40,cant get the harmonyos update try all the solution and dont even have firmwar more you might need to set region to china and for the upgrade to harmonyos from emui you need to check the harmonyos section in the my huawei app
Huawei,Mate 40,no vanilla mate is china exclusive which means only harmonyos cant get the harmonyos update try all the solution and dont even have firmware download can you help me
Huawei,Mate 40,can anyone tell me will mate get the emui update or not because havent seen it more no vanilla mate is china exclusive which means only harmonyos
Huawei,Mate 40,really good device
Huawei,Mate 40,hello is it possible can use google photos on huawei mate thank you very much for more only if you install google play services or use gspace solution which emulates google services
Huawei,Mate 40,super flagship phone in
Huawei,Mate 40,please does huawei mate support fm radio yes
Huawei,Mate 40,its so beautiful
Huawei,Mate 40,just root the phone and make it ise google normally cloud you please share how you root mate thanks
Huawei,Mate 40,amazon appstore apkpure cloud you please share how you root mate thanks
Huawei,Mate 40,hello loved this phone it looks super but sadly there is no google play store please more microg with aurora store
Huawei,Mate 40,no one cares though if you cant live without gms thats you problem see your point of view but the application selection on the huawei app gallery is heavily restricted as most developers have not made versions of their app for the gallery or they are not allowed to affiliate with huawei because it is on the us entity list hopefully it gets removed from the list as they are good company and will significantly increase the us tax profits from companies such as google because huawei will pay to get google features the situation is still bit unclarified and many people in the tech enthusiast community wants huawei to be back in the game came from huawei smartphone couple of months ago and it is sad that huawei may go national and only sell in china or may go into administration and close down huawei smartphones are not bad they are just discriminated from the country which the company is based in hope this helped
Huawei,Mate 40,where can find review of this phone when search in youtube mate it only shows the pro version
Huawei,Mate 40,the price does seem high but you do need to count inflation rates taxes shipping costs and more so then what is the regular price in china converted into dollars excluding any shipping costs and taxes
Huawei,Mate 40,they saying this has triple camera array but see fourth one in the picture what is tha more the price does seem high but you do need to count inflation rates taxes shipping costs and the improvements in technology that are in this model vs the previous model all while retaining similar price you can buy cheaper budget phones from huawei but recommend different brand because huawei does not have google services such as the google play store or chrome hope this helped
Huawei,Mate 40,happy new year
Huawei,Mate 40,thought it retains ip rating only the pro versions do im afraid just like all the other vanilla mate variants the only gets ip
Huawei,Mate 40,always like to follow phones sales but since when have been following it before users reviews you must see or more bad review but this phone have over users reviews on huawei store on jdcom with no single bad review its great phone indeed
Huawei,Mate 40,why is there no mate some love for us big phone fans please phones are alm more and yes know inch phones have always been rarity but due to the taller aspect ratios of phones these days means smaller in terms of screen area than it used to and just want phone that is an inch bigger than the norm
Huawei,Mate 40,main camera not ois
Huawei,Mate 40,what waste of super phone without google services this serves me nothing no uber apps no maps if this had google services this would be the worlds best phone no doubt
Huawei,Mate 40,mate amd was the last with decent screen format not too longhigh
Huawei,Mate 40,compared with samsung and apple phones at this price point its really good
Huawei,Mate 40,the camera super zoom xenon flash
Huawei,Mate 40,better pictures are out please use better pictures for this phone profile
Huawei,Mate 40,only see prejudice explain
Huawei,Mate 40,with no google play what are my options its great phone do we have to suffer coz us had problem good god
Huawei,Mate 40,still have the mate pro and its still the most beautiful phone made by huawei its still more no doubt mate pro is still legend
Huawei,Mate 40,nothing really fantastic quite disappointed with their recent new launches most newer models more still have the mate pro and its still the most beautiful phone made by huawei its still as beautiful as the day got it
Huawei,Mate 40,cant wait december will be here soon love the fact that this phone have stereo speakers its complete phone for me
Huawei,Mate 40,try googlefier
Huawei,Mate 40,sent the proof to gsmarena but it also only has ip as well as that wireless charging more thought it retains ip rating
Huawei,Mate 40,this rivals the iphone pro and note note is far behind so the iphone pro is the main rival mate beats iphone pro
Huawei,Mate 40,dennisk nov they even got the water resistant rating wrong just checked so no doubt it is china excl more only see prejudice
Huawei,Mate 40,ok good but there wasnt anything like wireless charging when it was announced in europe tha more they even got the water resistant rating wrong just checked so no doubt it is china exclusive feature
Huawei,Mate 40,china version have both wire and wireless charging of wthis phone have stereo speakers sent the proof to gsmarena but it also only has ip as well as that wireless charging its not only china version its mate overall allinall it is decent upgrade from the mate even if the size shrunk little
Huawei,Mate 40,thank god it googlefiered would like to thanks the xda developer for develop more nice does that mean all the security with google pay and so on are there too
Huawei,Mate 40,looking the phone from front impossible to say if it is motorola oppo oneplus or huawei ridiculous
Huawei,Mate 40,mrandreeew oct looking good with specifications but wo play market xda googlefier app will install gms easily
Huawei,Mate 40,looking good with specifications but wo play market
Huawei,Mate 40,euro price range and no ois on main camera cmon
Huawei,Mate 40,wow they manage to keep the headphone jack good job
Huawei,Mate 40,it has stereo speakers nop
Huawei,Mate 40,guess my mate will live for another year mate is good phone but not good enough for more ive still got my mate its still very capable device and like the wider display
Huawei,Mate 40,am getting this phone for sureyellow leather with gold finish look so cool thats more like orange color suppose
Huawei,Mate 40,no stereo speakers for flagship grade mobile having plus display come on huawei don more it has stereo speakers
Huawei,Mate 40,ip realy dont think watch at huawei webpage the mate pro has ip not the mate ip only
Huawei,Mate 40,was making comparison since that guy said this phone is huge explained there are bigge more was making comparison since that guy said this phone is huge explained there are bigger phones than this think you can agree with me on that coz this is my point here
Huawei,Mate 40,demand review for this phone definitely agree with you mate we need thorough review of this mate model gsmarena please looking forward to it
Huawei,Mate 40,just noticed on their website that there is slightly thicker vegan leather option not sure which colours maybe the orange and green but that would be my preference no fingerprints and much grippier so no case required im loving this even more
Huawei,Mate 40,mm jack and ir port matte frosted finish hz display wow this is close to perfect love the colours and styling and camera layout nice to have some different and unique compared to the swathes of samsung copies only cons for me are that its little too tall and despise curved displays theyre utterly pointless why would anyone want their videos or any other content bent and distorted over the edges any sort of lighting will cause glare and reflections so youll not be able to see the content also one review mentioned that the keyboard buttons on the edges maybe difficult to press gms would be nice but you never know in few months fingers crossed may get this regardless just for the mm jack and ir port im finding it hard to replace my current xiaomi mi
Huawei,Mate 40,usually that is always the case alongside the series last years vanilla does ha more honestly speaking the jack will not matter to me as long as itll have the gms again ill immediately upgrade either to mate or mate update mate will have the jack
Huawei,Mate 40,just clear my doubt nowi watched the presentation again all mate series have dual speaker and stereo speakermaybe mate will not be as powerful as others but its stereo speaker its also ip happy about it
Huawei,Mate 40,what is big for you may feel normal in other peoples hands seems like youre tryi more was making comparison since that guy said this phone is huge explained there are bigger phones than this think you can agree with me on that coz this is my point here
Huawei,Mate 40,whether its apple or android all smartphones is the sameoverpriced im done gonna stick more wait and after four months it would be discounted with then you can make your choices all the best
Huawei,Mate 40,no it is not bigger than the pro do you know which one is very big the note ultra for more what is big for you may feel normal in other peoples hands seems like youre trying to make yourself feel better about something
Huawei,Mate 40,you may not like it but like it it could have been worse the problem is no google services to me
Huawei,Mate 40,checked the other websites and they say it has stereo speakers this is amazing
Huawei,Mate 40,this mobile is better than iphone price is similar
Huawei,Mate 40,phone freaking huge and its overpriced no it is not bigger than the pro do you know which one is very big the note ultra for example the lg is even bigger almost cm long that is very big phone not this one the price is kinda ok not perfect but acceptable you will still get very good camera plenty of storage good battery life since huawei is good in this category you will get nice vegan leather back not boring glass design
Huawei,Mate 40,vanilla mates normally have the jack and the pro dont usually that is always the case alongside the series last years vanilla does have one whereas the pro doesnt but starting this year even the vanilla doesnt have the mm audio jack so id definitely be surprised to see if the vanilla mate has one
Huawei,Mate 40,hold on minute do the mate really has mm audio jack port id be surprised if more vanilla mates normally have the jack and the pro dont
Huawei,Mate 40,compared to competitors at this pricepoint this phone is literally the king
Huawei,Mate 40,overpriced and no google service even if its made by moon metal its have no sense mais bravo ils resistent
Huawei,Mate 40,did they seriously remove the stereo speakers on the vanilla that was virtually the reason more they didnt if you go to their official website you can see they talk about duel speakers and core graphics
Huawei,Mate 40,looks like samsung from the front and nokia from the back ugly colour ask anyone anyone theres more than color
Huawei,Mate 40,apart from the obvious lack of google services there are two mayor flaws in my opinion some exotic memory card format and curved screen other than that nice device even mm jack is there price is appropriate for what it offers well aligned with competition but not for me need google services and dont wanna rely on some third party hacks to get them
Huawei,Mate 40,dxo samples awesome just confirm what expected better colors and detail super hdr also on top its funny how when dxo says one brand is good people scream fake yet when another brand is said to be good people believe the results
Huawei,Mate 40,with better optics and processing camera should perform even above ps it also got jack you can compare then just to likes of xperia but guess it resolves more detail than xperia
Huawei,Mate 40,love it single front facing camera nice colors not too big just love it good job hu more phone freaking huge and its overpriced
Huawei,Mate 40,hi like it very ma this huawei mate
Huawei,Mate 40,love how it looks it is not copy of samsung galaxy or one plus the colors are nice more looks like samsung from the front and nokia from the back ugly colour ask anyone anyone
Huawei,Mate 40,deleted post love how it looks it is not copy of samsung galaxy or one plus the colors are nice too love that yellowish color
Huawei,Mate 40,prefer this mate more from the rest especially having headphone jack and has the lowest price even if its only ip base on the official launch video
Huawei,Mate 40,wish they made the regular mate flat screen and the pro and pro with that curved screen
Huawei,Mate 40,it look nice but price so hight
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,my worry is since it doesnt have google service what if my desired app or so important more simple try to find an other app with the same functions
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,as if other companies behave differently are you trolling know right they were going on about china and huawei when samsung ceo is still on bail for bribing government officials and apple happily leaking your data last year via any web browser you used thats on top of the other major data leaks theyve done in the last years and working closely with the american and british governments samsung too some people really make me laugh lol
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,china is not playing by the book rede up on the history of huawei and you might understand more as if other companies behave differently are you trolling
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,yooh nice phone huawei mate rs porsche like that phone
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,to date this is still the best phone in the world upgraded price dont always translate too better smartphone same case for the sony xperia proi the best overall smartphone today most likely the lenovo legion better specs lower price
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,you can get an android phone with no google services huawei should advertise this fact as feature there are no other phones in the world which arent based on alphabet inc
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,why no more porsche logo
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,sure would buy if it had gb ram gb rom ahmah battery umm it already comes it gb storage and as if gb ram for is not enough do agree on battery tho
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,deleted post cant have an android os and no google services
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,proffesional photographer will just use normal equipment not phone agree
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,man at first that kirin cpu compared to old ones is much less powerhungy than any of its prece more camera did much better job cameras can send pictures directly to your phone via wifi or bluetooth
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,hahahaha yes and if am wrong please educate me first of all emui is not good second of all it is overly expensive bezels can be distracting the pill cutout on the screen is huge dont get me started on apple and the battery is only mah for such powerhungry phone no google services no one needs cameras on phone all we need is ultrawide telephoto and wide thats it no dumb depth sensors and monochrome sensors and none of that
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,hahahahano hahahaha yes and if am wrong please educate me
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,so far the best phone on the market for sure hahahahano
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,huawei is licensed to sell variety of products some of them chips there is no mention of chips with technology however applications for additional licenses are still pending so hawaiis confidence in solutions from qualcomm is not yet fully buried no chips from qualcomm whether qualcomm will get license from the us government to supply genabled cellular chips for smartphones is still in the stars
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,for euros its definitely not better its so much cheaper in china and defiently affordable for the design and specs
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,awesome but without google this phone is like porsche without driver porsche without wheels put your own
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,trump leave white house huawei google
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,hope huawei can fix the its relationship with google and usa since donald trump will leave more yessss please bring back huawei always want to use huawei phone
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,waw its iphone series competitor more like competitor
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,wish porsche design wouldve teamed up company play services still wish could get one of the blackberries from years ago
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,really
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,wish it had google play services no considerations youre blubbering about stuff that are most likely never going to happen of course its shame and bummer but doesnt seem like huawei cares that much
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,is it android its alien
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,heavy phone
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,for euros could buy two note ultra which is way better than huawei consisting goo more wrong
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,when you are billionare you dont care too much about why phone has that retail price more hence being luxury product
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,who actually cares without google it doesnt even exist idk bunch of people who know its not the end of the world
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,wht its called porsche design mean what angle it looks or resembles with porsces design not even slightest nor for any tiniest angle
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,haha haha haters its the best phone years from now until samsung and apple come with more for euros its definitely not better
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,its ok for its price even though there is no google its easy to put google services in this devce thats not big deal
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,with no google you can download google from thousand of website directly thru the browser dont make it fuss that google is not there and cant use google is also an apk that just needs to download after that the phone works as per normal
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,using these huawei gadgets without google services is drawing me down now wanna buy the mate porsche but the experience with the preceding smartphones without google services and been that harmony is not released makes using some simple apps very difficult am an ardent huawei user and cant stop how do we by pass these hurdle asap please any inputs
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,away from google screen to body ratio and everything mentioned here have anyone compared pr more its about the design no specs
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,thats literally the thing it is being counted the screen to body ratio can be calculated more then show your math
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,yes the screen to body ratio is the screen to body ratio which is affected by that massive ho more thats literally the thing it is being counted the screen to body ratio can be calculated and it counts in the hole the screen to body ratio is
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,when people become more reasonable then prices will be more reasonable its simple when you are billionare you dont care too much about why phone has that retail priceyou buy it for you or your kids and thats it besides almost of the global population can easily afford this phoneand huawei knows it
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,euros and no google services no one will buy it only about half billion chinese and me maybe although my pro is still rockin
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,cool neednt gsuit and will buy it why are you replying to me with that didnt even mention googles applications was just talking about the screen to body ratio being lie
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,use phone take picsok but beware where data will go to your phone did get it
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,the only company in this world that supports huawei is porsche and lecia
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,dennisk oct downplay curves all you want but im not buying flat display flagship unless its iphone rightly said
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,too expensive it doesnt need your to money too
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,huaweis competitor is samsung not apple compare the mate pro to the note ultra the mate pro wins but with price of huawei should have kept go sotrage option for the mate pro thats the only frustrating thing about the mate pro they couldve reduced the price by at least dollars
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,huawei includes at mate series charger earphones and usb cable apple
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,phone with battery of and charge euro kekw
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,its huawei but guess you buy it from porshe design therfore does it come with google services gmail etc
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,people who dont have money want iphone and they buy iphone no matter what people with cash will buy something like this or note
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,what makes this phone so better up and different from the pro that makes this one very expensive like that this one is out
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,euro must have tb gb ram ddr you do it will buy too
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,for phone with no google services what would you die without google
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,so in other words screentobody ratio is massive lie cool neednt gsuit and will buy it
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,too expensive its not for you
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,ok but that hole the size of jupiter still exists no matter how big it is the screen to body ratio is screen body ratio this cannot be changed this is known information you can not argue with the information
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,yeah it does you know what forget about what said you can see on the sides curve lot more
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,even with holepunch the size of jupiter the side curves are quite substantial ok but that hole the size of jupiter still exists
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,with that curve think it is even with holepunch the size of jupiter the side curves are quite substantial
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,this is essentially luxury device
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,too expensive some richies would pay more just to say have unique mobile
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,including cutout probably so in other words screentobody ratio is massive lie
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,and how might ask did you calculate the surface area of the massive hole punch so think the figures misleading at best wouldnt really consider it lie
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,calculated it myself and got so huawei isnt lying here and how might ask did you calculate the surface area of the massive hole punch
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,no qhd screen resolution sorry
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,kinda like it actually except for the curved screen
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,sick design ruined by stupid capsule
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,optical zoom this is insane
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,the curved display is getting really old dont want phone that looks like samsung ga more downplay curves all you want but im not buying flat display flagship unless its iphone
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,what happened to fps
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,the most innovative mobile
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,that screen to body ratio is massive lie with that curve dont think it is
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,only hz
Huawei,Mate 40 RS Porsche Design,but where is the mate rs porsche design here
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,oh wow it has almost everything like external storage not msd and audio jack might need to find myself nano memory cards not sure about how it works because it had the size of nano sim card it might use both sides type slot
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,the average consumer has headphone jacks so dont act like innovation is more like this phone were am go to find it and how am going to do
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,oh yes average consumers dont give flying about essential hardware features head more the average consumer has headphone jacks so dont act like innovation is endorsed by most
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,are you calling the average consumer clown really who do you think you are oh yes average consumers dont give flying about essential hardware features headphone jacks that is why apple can keep bleeding money from their fanbase because they only care about brand bragging rights android power users do care about essential hardware features that is why midrange phones are now more popular than the flagship
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,what do you guys really do with google services anyway dont understand the reason beh more its just that some apps dont work as it should or do not at all without google play services its not gonna be factor as long as wouldnt have any problems with apps
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,can properly use google play services
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,if you give clown emoji because that yuki guy mentions headphone jack then you are the bi more are you calling the average consumer clown really who do you think you are
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,if huawei can release mate variant with either the kirin or the kirin chips more there already is huawei mate pro model with karin you can even compare the right here on this very same site
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,for one am not familiar with harmonyos but essentially this means theres still no goog more what do you guys really do with google services anyway dont understand the reason behind it anyway if you can check what you do with your phone everyday you will find that it has no use at all
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,deleted post if you give clown emoji because that yuki guy mentions headphone jack then you are the big clown not him
Huawei,Mate 40E 4G,welcome back huawei with harmony
Huawei,Mate 40E,where to find this device english version got mate mate and before some other and models really happy with huawei devices
Huawei,Mate 40E,how to download google internet apps dual space and app gallery petal search
Huawei,Mate 40E,no man have the huawei nova for year now and its bad go get xiaomi mi lite more lie have nova without google services it is very nice xioami have much problem
Huawei,Mate 40E,so many variants of the mate and mate but dont see when are we having the one please make the mate or mate soon this is taking too long
Huawei,Mate 40E,why huawei left own system file system comeback to ufs huaweis hisilicon sfs chip is only on the mate pro and mate rs
Huawei,Mate 40E,jack mar almost perfect phone just needs higher refresh rate and possibly hidden face cam hz refresh rate for the display heats the screen
Huawei,Mate 40E,almost perfect phone just needs higher refresh rate and possibly hidden face cam
Huawei,Mate 40E,it looks like huawei is getting rid of all the old stock last ditch effort yeah similar specs to mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40E,atleast you show me one great thing in this phone you cannot dollars headphone jack and edge display at this price
Huawei,Mate 40E,so why did they make mate pro
Huawei,Mate 40E,no reverse wireless charging still and when did kirin appear and then they made with kirin chip this is getting confusing
Huawei,Mate 40E,mm jack take my money
Huawei,Mate 40E,bucks for this beaty is bargain no google services no problem harmoney os soon or later will be far better
Huawei,Mate 40E,sounds like great value for
Huawei,Mate 40E,and the diffrience is slightly different primary camera module and slower chipset and being much much cheaper
Huawei,Mate 40E,take my services
Huawei,Mate 40E,hmm interesting
Huawei,Mate 40E,if their sales are falling they might as well drop the prices of their phones
Huawei,Mate 40E,mm jack
Huawei,Mate 40E,great job huawei atleast you show me one great thing in this phone you cannot
Huawei,Mate 40E,at least this one has telephoto unlike xiaomi phones
Huawei,Mate 40E,it is actually another member of ancient series
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the portrait mode dosent work after few clicks when the mobile is heated hellooo was just wondering if my mate pro will get harmonyos next
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,there is big difference between the huawei mate se and the huawei mate pro
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hello anybody knows why huawei mate pro telephoto camera doesnt take portrait photos and usual photos of people with its zoom camera is very poor of detailhow to improve it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,very poor quality photos missing sharpness night shots are aweful compared to pro more you have never own huawei phone
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,beautiful phone awesome camera module the only downside is that some fringe apps may still not install like enbd for example it throws the error that the device is rooted so always check all your crucial apps in the store before buying otherwise its great so far
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hey guys cant find the fps opton at slow moton
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,solid device bad battery life
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,so am using since january and compare to the only thing is better is display muc more if you need gmail you can use gbox gspace or the email its really good and kinda similar to gmail
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no no google so am using since january and compare to the only thing is better is display much bettey and selfie camera emailgmail works better on
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the best smartphone ever ive been usedstart using my st huawei nova then bought ne more wonder how is the display under the direct sunlight
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hi is there purple color variant
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,im wondering about yhe leather material after year or years if what will happen
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,after much debating purchased this month ago and not regretting it bit have been using the mate series since launch and pro gives the same amazing experience with fluid interface and incredible battery life have side loaded essential google and meta apps with gbox gspace and those works flawlessly entire play store is also accessible via the paid version of gspace app gallery has most of the apps in it now huawei music is much improved too and am using it more than you tube music now
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei makes the best phones with great innovation this phone for example has much better implementation of variable aperture and the photos with the all the cameras look stunning main telephoto ultra wide im certainly impressed with the portrait shots previously had the honor play and it was great phone at that time huawei and honor werent separated but unfortunately huawei was targeted unfairly by the us thankfully it let huawei create their own ecosystem would definitely like to get this phone but after sales service doesnt exist in my country am more of camera person and have used several flagship phones from various brands huawei is no doubt giant company with great potential to give though competition to other manufacturers unfortunately us tech companies are dominating the world currently and it would few years to create viable alternative so hope huawei make strong comeback soon
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,grt device to own it in ur hands and daily driver
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,every gsmarena reviews of huawei devices always downgrade of not having gmslike hello more please is the phone advisable to use please need your points what about the camera and version is it android and is or network dont know much about them products one to give the mate try
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,nice advertisement dude nice and truth based
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no google wanting to know your every move and every conversion to sell all your information to target advertisingo dear
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,if it would only have google services and
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,deleted post heres the funny bit huawei knows palm rejection through the two years used my pro and it never had any issues with palm rejection your concerns are valid however google is terrible at palm rejection tap song on spotify and put my phone in my pocket while pressing the power button to turn it off before that has happened my pinkie has grazed the edge and selected another song and thats before we talk about the proximity sensors they dont work the pro can disable its screen when you cover the screen or present mistouches while its in pocket even if you havent turned it off pixel is quite happy to let any object interact with it most annoyingly sleeves and palms this was concern of mine regarding samsung unfortunately dont know and all my concerns were confirmed regarding the pixel that doesnt mean its bad phone im just saying that huaweis software is just better at behaving itself
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,only gb ram no gb ram its epic fail will say my transition from pro with gbs of ram to pixel pro with gbs its noticeable the pixels battery life is rather poor however which is expected it tries to keep all apps open and clearly leverages all of its ram its pretty funny how was able to juggle back and forth between genshin impact and asphalt without missing beat both apps ran at the same time the poor tensor was screaming however huawei tunes its software towards maximum battery life my pro never utilized all of its ram unless forcibly pushed it with emui desktop and honestly neither the pro nor the pixel does it perfectly the pro is too conservative and will kill any background apps just to save battery while the pixel keeps everything open and handles everything smoothly at the expense of battery doubt that the mate pro is any different from the pro but if the pro can watch youtube at while scrolling through instagram feed videos with gbs of ram the mate pro can do more
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,where can buy it in europe on the offical huawei website germany httpsconsumerhuaweicomdephonesmateprobuy france httpsconsumerhuaweicomfrphonesmateprobuy turkey httpsconsumerhuaweicomtrphonesmateprobuy

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,bulbulitobayagbag nov why do you need so much ram the iphone has less ram than its android flagship counterparts more because they dont know multitask lolx
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,at the zoom setting the sample images show noticeably more detail than at thats impressive it means that huawei leverages the megapixel mode of the sensor
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,years ago jesus marry still relevant in nowadays there are even companies out there who make mobile lenses for portrait photography httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvncblhrmg
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,why dont you test pro mode raw shots for action photography to show how looks shutter lag try to take raw shots of playing children animals freeze action jumping on trampoline bike basket or volleyball match for years huawei phones have shutter lag and company ignores this fact and cheats nest generations customers with empty slogans
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you cant judge only by these studio shots though you can maybe judge detail and noise more refer to my earlier comment regarding the photos from natural environment dont deny that this is flagship grade performance but stress that this is not worth the hype demonstrated by this article
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,studio merely means high degree of standardization not detachment from reality studio shot more soesnt matter nobody who is professional in job using some phone jeeezz but have expensive setup cameras with massive lenses
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,laughs in nokia lumia studio photoshoot httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbbdzknffcwu years ago jesus marry
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is this really end of display that curved is disgrace everybody already know that cur more am using mate pro with that curved display and never had any mistouch or other issues
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,see alot of gamers on this site saying some phones are no good for playing games on for games guys you build your own gaming pctower stylethere are so many phones on the market now and we get very wide choicethe technology is also changing very fastis their perfect phonenot really you just get get phones that will suit most of your needs and the main thing is you get secure phone with good software that you can trustandriodapple or whateverits dont really matter am very amazed how far phone tecnology has comeits awesome technology
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ah had look at the studio shots the xiaomi is almost outright better in both lighting cond more you cant judge only by these studio shots though you can maybe judge detail and noise when cropped in but you need real world samples to judge all the other facets of camera performancethe xiaomi phones seem to be better for detail in the studio but have more noise but even then you need to judge noise and detail in variety of scenarios in good light xiaomi will still easily beat the xiaomi ultra or xiaomi ultra for detail and most other phones but it will struggle in lowlight real world performance is the most important thing theyll basically trade blows apart from the front cameras where the xiaomi phones are weak
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,since when studio workers shooting with an smartphone get proper camera laughs in nokia lumia studio photoshoot httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbbdzknffcwu
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,where see only the white cdm for brightness but not for brightness its in the text just above the table with the brightness results the minimum brightness at point white was below nits which is great too
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,there are more gestures in emui that are never mentioned pulling up from screen corner starts assistant sliding across screen botomleft or right switches between recent appsback or forward great device sadly crippled by us sanctions
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,looking at studio shots ultra is the best have seen and mi ultra second best while more since when studio workers shooting with an smartphone get proper camera
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the number is already on page where see only the white cdm for brightness but not for brightness
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hmm id say the day samples are better than the night samples relative to the competition and likewise the uwa and tele samples stand out more than the mains samples the blur close up is decent but thats determined by the exit pupil and type even at cannot enable marvelous bokehy portraits by the limits of physics and still cringe at the fake bokeh because no matter how accuratelynot that this is already pixelperfect not even at glance the edges are cut out thats not the issue at this level of blur the shallow dof of at that magnification should render persons ears slightly out of focus when the nose is perfectly in focus and when the face is in focus the pants would likely be somewhat out of focus none of thats implemented so it cant possibly look realistic there are some strange artifacts on his sweater though but they dont seem to come from dof and they seem unnatural compared to the rendering of his face details also cannot be resolved in the best possible way because were far from the limits of software processing so nobody knows whats the best possible way even some dng output achieved with current software look more natural the night samples have lot of aliasing artifacts suggesting lack of oversampling during processing combined with detrimental upscaling step very far down the pipeline and still have too much nr at they have the typical huawei waxy look similar to models years ago and night mode doesnt help as much as its supposed to anyhow an objective review should avoid hyperbole such as those mentioned above or those such as calling the camera setup as cool as you can imagine in the intro can easily imagine cooler thank you this isnt supposed to be an ad piece but it comes across as very unprofessional not up to par with gsmas usual reviews
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,that is also world first there has never been any smartphone with telephoto camera that can more there have been few xiaomi phones that have telemacro lens although they all had tiny mp sensors that would also struggle to focus on distant subject the one on mate rs is quite special because not only it doubles as regular telephoto lens does it also have longer mm equivalent focal length and much higher resolution sensor that allows for extreme cropping making it far more versatile as secondary camera
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the portrait mode on the mate pro offers and zoom levels they all use the main camera and are shot at aperture for natural bokeh rather than artificially generated one no gsmarena this is still synthetic bokeh applied to the photos afterwards using the software processing get that the edge detection on this phone is so precise that its hard to distinguish it from the real bokeh until you start zooming in but its impossible for any phone to produce this amount of blur with its relatively tiny optics in fact these portrait shots seem to have just as much subject separation as what would be captured by fullframe sensor paired with an lens of the same mm equivalent focal length huawei is slowly coming to its senses in terms of image quality after the effective death of kirin the cameras on the sd variant of pro completely failed to impress but this one seems to be lot better rounded the lens is now tack sharp all the way down to the extreme corners details are no longer oversharpened at least during the day low light shots have more processed looking to them and they finally nailed the colour balance on the ryyb cfa and managed to make the photos look pretty much indistinguishable from those taken by regular rggb sensor crop zoom shots look bit blurry but guess thats due to their image stacking algorithms still not being properly optimised for sd chipset hopefully honor can learn thing or two from huawei to keep up their mobile photography game
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei has the best cameras this is an amazing phone
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,its not really the end of the world as there are multiple solutions to install gms legally but not all of the apps work and that is big shame im bit lost now have oneplus pro and would like to replace it with something newer do care almost only about still shots can wait until the premiere of the samsung ultra and mobiles that do consider are iphone pro pixel pro and ultra for jpgs they are somehow similar but when it comes to raws iphone shines and do care about it as used to care my mirrorless on vacations and would like to replace it with that new mobile huawei mate pro looks great as for what need but dont like the idea that some of the apps that use might not be working on my new phone ehh
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,xiaomi has telemacro lens that one is native macro sensor but with telephoto focal length in other words its still macro camera in the first place the one on the mate rs porsche design is the other way around as in native telephoto sensor but with macro autofocus capability
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,bulbulitobayagbag oct just like the other phones that came before it the lack of gms will hinder it as lot of pe more its not really the end of the world as there are multiple solutions to install gms legally
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,they should also review the rs porsche version soon because of the periscope camera having the more that is also world first there has never been any smartphone with telephoto camera that can also do macro let alone having large mp resolution
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,mr anonymous nov wish samsung and apple were as innovative in camera department as huawei on the other hand more samsung is the first to create mp nona bayer and mp to bayer sensor so at least they are trying their own idea cant say the same for apple though
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,kirin is not that good as people thinks its just another arm soc only advantage is the integ more all other soc use mali gpu including samsung only qualcomm has its own adreno gpu but for normal everyday use im still impressed with kirin ive been using my mate for three months now and im really happy with its overall performance even when using the emui desktop feature
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,as much as like the camera performance still prefer the vanilla mate mainly because of the flat screen panel it may only have hz refresh rate compared to this pros hz but im still okay with hz since there are still loads of apps that cant go beyond hz do have to lose the brilliant mp zoom telephoto camera but im glad to see huawei didnt give worse main camera for the vanilla and also the base gpowered model
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,not exactly true that nobody likes apple or samsung photos unfortunately average person is more exactly true photography enthusiast can easily tell how good or bad smartphone photo is
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,does the ban affects the short outcome of the devices huawei made or they are just limiting th more the most hurtful thing ifor huawei the access to production of kirin chips they receive sd chips but in limited numbers and without also the way they tweak the kirin made the huawei extremely responsive without being champion in tests also battery life is very good in those phones that used kirin
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,it is bit better on flagships in camera department butfar behind in many other parts more they make the best android skin around so many useful features that no other brand has
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,please add maximum white brightness when brightness set to this is important when someone more the number is already on page
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,for euro phone in we have seen way better batteries from competitorsnot to mentio more has larger mah battery which also happens to power smaller lowerresolution display its impressive that samsung managed to pull off that battery score with the regular but your comparison is bit flawed
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,battery life is mediocre it just inline with other sd gen phones almost hit nits more again nits would be great in previous years but we are getting to in some weeks so when huawei is asking yeah would expect better peak brightness from such an expensive flagship that lacks google servicesg check the brightness comparison with the other devices mate pro max auto vivo pro xiaomi ultra ultra iphone pro max
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,tf phone scoring over hours endurance yet you still called it mediocre battery life for euro phone in we have seen way better batteries from competitorsnot to mention the phone heavily throttles anyways the galaxy with same battery scored hours and it has worse chip than snap gen
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,dimensity use mali and it can beat snapdragon gen mali at current state can run any more dimensity is still behind in gpu benchmarks compared to adreno kirin using previous gen mali gpu which is worse than adreno even
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,lol iphone is probably the worst option for photos in modern cameras the overprocessing is ey more absolutely agree people know nothing about photography all they care about is selfies and snapchat filters iphone are absolutely garbage when it comes to skin texture microcontrast and high iso photos
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is there any android app that goes thru installed apps on phone with gms and shows which app more you can download gspace and maybe of google play apps work just fine
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,their problem is kirin soc not google if they can produce kirin even in nm they will kic more kirin is not that good as people thinks its just another arm soc only advantage is the integrated modem they still used mali gpu in latest
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this is probably the worst performance on snap gen devicenon foldable also the more battery life is mediocre it just inline with other sd gen phones almost hit nits peak brightness is good enough to use under bright sunlight also nothing wrong with being full predictable at least people still expect great camera from huawei and they still deliver and keep the legacy from the original and about the price lack of totally agree with you they overcharge this gonna stay with my mate pro that have connectivity
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,used to have various mate phones in the past and they were always great phones especially more have huawei the last tiny flat screen flagship even better still support its tiny beast
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,it can be so perfect but without no sorry
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,really understand thats terrible without but okay for almost next years and performance you get today at many places and also understand that people like to play eg pokmon go which will not work cause the game uses location but specially contacts from google services therefor it is not running but ethe ecosystem is worth it to be reviewed and its almost enough offering to deal and play with on the other hand there are lot people which likes mobiles from fruit brand only but see no working good textcorrection working until today german no reverse charging eg earbuds watch no free filemanagement photos mp no standardized sharing or briadcast allowed really suffering cameraexperiences at photos no free customization off startscreen lockscreen still but now bit openend no ringtone notifications free choice whats up today only from over and people dont tell that this is really bad offer bad customer related
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the snapdragon chipset will work fine but huawei was working on the kirin chipsets with soc and thats where it was awesome
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the cameras are great but apple still wins overall due to its crazy good videos the cost is more lol iphone is probably the worst option for photos in modern cameras the overprocessing is eyescorching pixel is an even bigger joke worse than more sharpness than before even stronger unreal hdr lot of artifacts photos are unpredictable and can look decent or just fail with massive amount of lut noise either way xiaomi ultra is unarguably the champion of stock cameras the problem being the standard the value system completely messed up which says artificial oversharpened photos are better however if you care about your photo quality and dont use gcam mod then youre doing things wrong
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,suddenly everyone wants google apps and main thing is that on iphones they never use it hypocrites suddenly on iphoone gaps are not needed
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,lol just look at the dxomark scores you have no idea what youre saying lol cant take anyone who refrence dxomark seriously
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,another nuclear phone that throttle so bad so even if it had ggoogle it would still feel not worth price
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this site has been suffering from huawei bias for years no matter how good its cameras are if any other phone maker would offer premium priced phone in with no no google services relatively cheap design only gb of ram and this kind of performance throttling it wouldnt get more than stars
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,youve seriously gone off the rails trying to convince people phone with relatively more the wide aperture means mate pros main camera takes in just as much light as mi ultra per exposure larger sensor means nothing if the physical aperture of the lens remains small unless youre shooting at the base iso where the difference in image quality between phones will be minimal thanks to image stacking anyway this also means mate pro is and more light sensitive than ultra and iphone pro max respectively mate has relatively small sensor compared to its peers but makes up for it by having large diameter iris now im wondering who is really disconnected from the reality
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you clearly have no taste and blind eyes in photography no one likes samsung and apples more not exactly true that nobody likes apple or samsung photos unfortunately average person is so oblivious that they actually prefer overprocessed photos because it looks good when its compressed on social media ive heard so many hilarious criticism about the xiaomi ultra that its bad because it lacks details of iphone etc people simply dont understand anything about photography or technology in general
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,phone nowadays seems more of the software vs hardware comparison but still feel most hardware esp the photography and videography side stands out between companies samsung and apple maybe claiming no spot as they claim to be its likely the china phones lead by huawei and vivo now that can spearhead mobile photography to the next level huawei already the st to introduce multicam photography from its series and zoom in series tof focused selfie on and honor and now this variable shutter in mate series vivo leading the night supremacy after huawei if not on par without the rgyy night photography and videography whats more important is they are price competitively apart from middleman charges hope to see more improvements coming from them instead of the bloated wares samsung and apple feed their dumb fanbases with
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,wish samsung and apple were as innovative in camera department as huawei on the other hand in camera comparison preferred the shots from xiaomi ultra
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,just proves that harmony is android with another skin on top they wouldnt survive without android apps at all
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei seems to have invested lot in that lens module stop aperture control excellent fine details rendering and the bokeh at seems pretty good for phone great hardware achievement the image processing also is very mature
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,actually like huawei mate pro the design is beautiful and new emui too just have one more if you use gesture navigation the pill will appear it also can be hid if you dont want to see it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this is what happens when sony imx squeezed to the max lol
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this phones actually ugly the back
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,well the pictures are absolutely beautiful im beyond impressed
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,why on earth would androids be rocking the notch sad
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,really impressed with the camera performance especially the zoom photos having different apertures really helps lot with the depth of field you can see how crisp and sharp the subject is while not having any soft edges on it it may not have google mobile services which can be huge turnoff to most people but can live without google and im really liking this phone lot
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,impresive phonebtw whats wrong with xiaomi battery lately sigh
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,sensor cannot be in flagship smartphone this is serious degradation according to the testing though the results are excellent its an ryyb sensor too so that improves light input the end result is the most important thing in any case
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,very impressive
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,rip camera innovation born from competition lazy samsung and apple back in the driver seat sigh
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,to is little also there is possibility that the crop is from then downsized to more down to is lot its reduction is quad bayer count the bayer pattern is only mp without some multi frame technique you dont get any more resolution than mp bayer sensor
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei has finished dying they dont even love you in china
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,just like the other phones that came before it the lack of gms will hinder it as lot of people use google app gallery is still far from being in the same level as the google playstore and the apple app store
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,crop is little the upscale to mp will not damage photo it has been done for years alr more squared is is is so that is significant loss in resolution if it was basic crop and upscale yes the corners are never as sharp as the center because light has to travel further at the edges this is made worse with camera movement
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,it is much more than simple crop believe they are using multi frame technique similar more crop is little the upscale to mp will not damage photo it has been done for years already this allows to keep cam module slimmer edges are cut so portions of photos with lower quality corners are never as good as center no matter if lens is or go away
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,brilliant phone all around looks very premium huawei is still nailing the camera performance as usual love the way their phones render foliage certainly hope huawei keeps making phones doesnt give up like lg htc did
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,waiting for someone to complain about lacking gms and lack of grin
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this has mm camera photos are cut to match mm camera by default it is like using more it is much more than simple crop believe they are using multi frame technique similar to super res zoom that can near losslessly zoom into the frame to create mm equivalent image most reviewers dont seem to notice loss in detail simple crop from to mm of mp image is mp and that loss of resolution should be very noticeable
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,for me despite the lack of google services and other shortcomings the main cameras mm foca more this has mm camera photos are cut to match mm camera by default it is like using digital zoom on any other
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,used this phone for months pros really good cameras selfie and rear materials faceid very cool feature screen powerful processor for flagship ip dp stereo charging ok battery cons telephoto camera is darker than main camera not amoled and not ltpoltps screen nd speaker is earpiecefrontal speaker no native support for google services easy to install with microg gen is not so energyefficient and like to overheat in games but overall its really good phone it feels like flagship even today
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,when you use this phone you will miss nothing use it for years and already miss it one of the greatest phones ive ever had maybe will check in use market for one
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,even flagship that years old does have usb and many of midrange phones doesnt
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,few of you have asked for an opinion on this phone its already been said its more woah sounds amazing im on look out for this thank you for the info
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,anyone can tell me about the battery performance
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,somebody using this phone nowadays what is it like is it fast is it reliable how is the battery
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,will the chinese mate pro varient get harmonyos next no only devices with krini soc
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,using this phone for almost months now and in camera department this phone is excellent more is it still horrible
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,does any one know why the software limited the fps to in gaming that supports mlbb runs only and iam pretty sure have enabled on both device and the game itself ive noticed that even light games that support only runs on fps like subway surfer and altos odyssey anyone have the same prop here

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,agree with you the missing esim is really weak point and the second see is just gb more cant you just turn it off
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hello to everyone am samsung galaxy series user from galaxy onward was curious about huawei phones especially mate pro and mate pro bought one mate pro its super fast display is great smooth brightness is great too battery is also very good only when comes to camera department it really disappointed me whenever take photos they were not that sharp detailed and crisp when compared with my samsung galaxy ultra exynos version it really disappoint me what could be the reason of camera didnt like the colors of camera when zoom in pictures are not crisp telephoto camera poor quality

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,why they downgrade the super slowmotion from last device pfps to pfps
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no esim in very sus agree with you the missing esim is really weak point and the second see is just gb for such an expensive device what means that the number of years until apps do not work properly is limited anyway purchased it exactly because it has no extremely hot radiating
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,not as good as the mate pro pro they had gesture sensors while the mate pro more best without gesture sensor as other apps can use it to know what you type and to find your passwords
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hello everyone could anyone pls explain if its easy to get google apps heard its pain more its very simpleat the begining you install gbox and after that you search all your apps in app store like you do in play store

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,not recommended to buy because upi phonepe and other banking apps are all linked to play store only so not useful in indian market
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the kirin has never beaten the bionic in mobile socs no ones better than apple it can sometimes specially on some benchmarks and thermals so bionics are not always the best but they are the on the top when it comes to the price
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,dont deny that as former owner of the mate pro and even the honor before that more the kirin has never beaten the bionic in mobile socs no ones better than apple

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,are you sure you would like to buy this phone it doesnt have google services yeah it probably would have been big problem back with the mate pro but from what ive heard there is lot of workarounds now for apps such as google maps and youtube which are the main google apps use and everything else should be available though the app gallery or petal search
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,which one is better realme gt pro or huawei mate pro apart gms soc realme gt pro has nothing that can be compared to this huawei
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the price is very expensive and the design is repetitive google services are not included it more tell that to iphone design
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,having this phone makes you feel all other phones are behind you best camera you wanna tell more well clearly you have been tricked the mate pro is indeed among the best camera phones on the market but big mistake you could do about that is to trust dxomarks rankings theyre not accurate at all and brands actually might pay them to put their phone on the top or say good things about it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,mate series used to be wider in display but now its almost identical to series size more bruh this is literally the widest mate phone along side with mate pro the only mate device thats wider than this is the mate which was massive screen version of the mate
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,who the heck still uses headlphone jack and sd card in lot of people
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the in my country is really useless lots of complaints about missed calls and sms fortuna more no wifi be and
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,well wont argue anymore since havent tested out the ultras camera to more dont deny that as former owner of the mate pro and even the honor before that that was genuine evolution of smartphone when it released and im confident they still put out top cameras my point is since the ban they just havent been the same and its not their fault they stopped the production of their kirin processers which in my opinion was better than apples and dont have google play services on their phones which is major if none of that happened im pretty sure huawei would have been so far ahead of the game samsung would have been left in the dust and made apple look like rotten fruit
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,not this year im afraid the ultra just beats everyone in the camera department as more well wont argue anymore since havent tested out the ultras camera to say agree with you or not but huawei huawei is still killing it with their camera performance just check the pro and mate pro the gsmarena review they are still among the best
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,well huawei kind of leads the pack when it comes to overall camera performance the closest more not this year im afraid the ultra just beats everyone in the camera department as well as everything else finally it also competes with them in low light as well and in my experience with the samsung its actually better although its much more closer debate this time around huawei had they not been stopped in their paths would have been leading the pack by quite distance but theyve gone downhill since then really
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,wow camera is amazing better than the latest iphone and latest flagships of samsung well huawei kind of leads the pack when it comes to overall camera performance the closest to it are vivo honor and xiaomi
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,please is the mate good suggestion to buy need advice one to get one yeah go ahead and you wont regret your decision huawei phones are better from my experiences

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you cant trust these guys at all they dont review of the phones on the market so according to your somewhat hyperbolic comment that because you cant trust these guys at allthey dont review of the phones on the market therefore you cannot trust most reviewers and possibly even this site may not meet your criterianow that limits where to find info that can assist with make valid purchasing decision

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,after few years of engineering obviously the mate pro has better display the reason for more dont think this is accurate the us cannot ban company from using technology they are developing themselves know the whole ban is related to the development of where the us companies were lagging behind huawei so this ban gave us companies chance to catch up and the ban was based on the idea or lie that huawei was security threat to the us you can watch the news here just replace the blank spaces with dots www androidauthority comhuaweigoogleandroidban

Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,senseless correct
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,camera lens is very powerful and uses aperture of one of the best cameras on smartphone right now
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,inflation chip shortages senseless
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,owned several huawei phones huawei huawei mate and huawei omg honest to buddh more problem with their recent phones is its using the weaker ovendragon not their superior kirin socs due to us ban or unless they can mass produce nm or somehow breakthrough nm beyond
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,note the mate pro silver and black does not have kunlun glass only the orange version kunlun glass comes in variants orange and black there are kinds of black the one which has kunlun has leather back same like orange
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,they whoever they is took it down havent been able to find it change your huawei app store region to malaysia and then search for that app
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,mrnick nov youre wrong theres an app called lighthouse in huawei app store which lets more they whoever they is took it down havent been able to find it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,man seriously need new kirin soc thr kirin on pro is so much better than the sd
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,working fine chrome without account facebook whatsapp authentificator google and others more who need youtube anymore when we have newpipe or youtube vancedrevanced microg
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,such silly one mate ask sensible question please dont you know manufacturer has more suggest you same dont be offended usually people like you trying to be smart while their knowledge is equal to
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,why dont have such silly one mate ask sensible question please dont you know manufacturer has us sanction for not being able to use gms and outside china try and resist posting questions and comments which make no sense no offence this is my suggestion
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,overall the huawei mate series is good phone but for international users that rely on go more working fine chrome without account facebook whatsapp authentificator google and others not working gmail youtube but is available in store gspace with google play store
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,man dont use google service dont you see that they search your email payments more google services is fine everyones using it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,high price no google no not lot of things that competition has dont know how more sales ha ha dont worry about sales as im in cn know whats happening the phone launched here in september and even now the stock is finished within seconds whenever they release few units especially the kunlun glass models are impossible to get your hands on so to answer your question huawei doesnt need to care about selling it outside china thats why many chinese companies are making china only phones now with advanced tech and all
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no at why would anyone buy huawei which literally has no google play services man dont use google service dont you see that they search your email payments history to make personalized adds for you cant believe used gmail for last years
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,just use dongles mate more expenseneh but thanks
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,card slotnfcno jackno radio shocking just use dongles mate
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,decent phone overall but the price is tad too high
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hi guys have currently pro and reading through the review specifically battery enduran more mate pro talk time web browsing video playback mate pro talk time web browsing video playback the mate pro has lasted longer in web browsing and video playback obviously its the screen technology behind it the mate pro has better overall rating
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,for phone with date camera cutout no whu in the right mind will look it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,thats why us banned them so they wont have competition your right have pro for nearly years best phone ever had
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,agree this guy never used device with kirin processor for sure even after long perio more dont think its the kirin thats superior no believe huaweis own harmonyos has better optimization than the ordinary androidbased os the other phones are using considering genshin impact is chinese game
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,what on earth still no no mp camera no zoom even xiaomi has mp camera more it does not matterthey have phones with optical zoom and the higher mp doesnt equate to better photos
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,guess you havent used kirin flagship phone before compared it to flagship ovendragon more agree this guy never used device with kirin processor for sure even after long period of gaming or performance demanding application there is no heat or throttle read in forum before dont know how true it is but read that china develops the chips from tsmc much better than the us there is even information that the biren br currently outperforms the nvidia imagine if the biren brand which we dont know at all gives better performance than the wellestablished nvidia think there is very good engineering here and that they know the chip very well and know its limits
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,superior kirin hehe we have china bot here guess you havent used kirin flagship phone before compared it to flagship ovendragon have ovendragons throttles hard making genshin impact stuttery mess at max settings while kirin is stable you wont notice any stutters doesnt even burn your hands
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,thats because they keep using ovendragon instead of their own superior kirin socs superior kirin hehe we have china bot here
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no google service curved screen only china version and so crazy people
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,yes huawei is going downhill my mum has had such phones maybe even nova is better than more thats because they keep using ovendragon instead of their own superior kirin socs
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,except every other phones already have built in also wont be able to change cases wi more you have point here
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,oh dear feels like huawei are going backwards to me its as sad as the they wouldve been better making more pro plus phones as special editions
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this phone sells like hot cakes just kidding nobody wants it no google apps despite being quite looker and fine phone its just for china huaweis phone business is operating in the margins
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,looks like great phone wtih excellent camera features
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this beast is really smooth and fast whats the battery time
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,very advance phone in thw west this phone is as fast as any phone because all in the more are you using mate pro right now hows the battery life
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,so what exactly is the big difference from to very advance phone in thw west this phone is as fast as any phone because all in the west are speed only therefore whether you have phone or phone your spped are no different in china and in may countries with real then you may see the differences otherwise mate is an amazing phone can download most of the apps current available on google android phone to mat with absolutely no problem
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,bro in what way the camera design is square on mate and this design is circle
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,looks very familiar to mate
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this is to the people who have used this phone and please be honest how much better is it compared to mate pro what advice would you give to person who is budget conscious and wants the latest mate flagship
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the ugly notch is the deal breaker for me sht hauwei why wanna be the notch to me is classic feature that will remain iconic with the passage of time note this
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei usa not good match
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,pretty outdated rear design id say looks so much like the mate pro from years ago more the iphone style notch is because of the nd sensor which works like face recognition system it works in any environment doesnt get fooled by photo
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,its funny how marketing gets into peoples head is pure hype yeah its so fast by getting more well said
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,killer deal no google or lets buy hi you can use gspace for google apps it works really good ive been useing it as well
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,kunlun glass is only for orange version yes not only that the orange gets the kunlun glass it also features better ingress protection huawei states ip rating means that based on certain defined test conditions the device is protected against harmful ingress of static water at up to metres for the silver and black versions and up to metres for the orange version for up to minutes
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this phone looks cool still few reviews on youtube but mate pros photo samples really nice and colors looks natural hope gsm arena crew can get one and review
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the millions of people that are already using but go ahead make more excuses so what exactly is the big difference from to
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is good enough and not all areas having so whats your point as long as it works more the millions of people that are already using but go ahead make more excuses
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,why still there is no review for huawei mate series
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,its not dishonesty its being realistic youre only being naive because more yes im targeting dishonest manufacturers sorry know what you meant im just saying that fixed lenses should not be marketed with the term optical zoom forbes said it android authority said it wikipedia said so gsmarena defines it so what should add im only telling the truth about true optical zooms as we can see with two phones that exists xperia iv galaxy zoom in mate pro the optical zoom was added which as forbes describes as fake optical zoom and again not my word
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,research confirms that youre dishonest android authority enlightens their readers on more its not dishonesty its being realistic youre only being naive because never said has optical zoom yes scamsung is dishonest not me none of the articles deny smartphones having optical zoom they say these cameras only offer one level of optical zoom though so the authors accept at least one level of optical zoom which is done at different sensor but results in same field of view and optical magnification if focal length of main sensor was changed this isnt any different than what said never said smartphones have variable optical zoom except some xperia phones and sk zoom from samsung in past when they werent scamsung lol however some people here and you are being naive and outright denying phones with telephoto lens have optical zoom simply because of invariable focal length come on understand the context and limitations in smartphones variable focal length isnt easy as it needs space and moving parts so the best thing right now is separate sensor with longer focal length and even xperia iv separates the zoom sensor even though lens of it can move to change focal length so were only left with sk zoom and lets not push oems away from whatever good they still have would you rather have them putting mp even mp macro cameras instead of or camera which doesnt involve digial zoom hence optical
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this become strange with those dragons
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,on smartphone as someone mentioned the focal length of the telephoto camera is divid more research confirms that youre dishonest android authority enlightens their readers on what optical zoom really means misleading technical terms some smartphone companies like to muddy the waters by introducing smartphone camera marketing terms disguised as technical terms sometimes in an attempt to confuse readers this practice is particularly prevalent when it comes to zoom technology for example samsung invented the hybridoptic zoom term instead of saying the galaxy and simply used hybrid zoom technology it added the optic term leading some to think that the phones had telephotooptical zoom when they actually lacked this technology optical zoom in the context of smartphone sees telephoto or socalled periscope cameras being used for zoomedin shots these cameras only offer one level of optical zoom though eg rather than dslr cameras which are capable of moving lenses to offer several optical zoom levels articles quoted looking for new phone watch out for these camera marketing trends dont believe what smartphone manufacturers tell you about zoom hope this is clear honest and not misleading like all the other advertising lingoes that manufacturers are notoriously using
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,fixed lenses dont have true optical zoom end of story moving forward its great to see proper variable aperture being implemented on the mate series you also get it on the mate which is just an awesome thing that huawei have done im looking forward to proper zoom lenses like that of xperia iv from here on out if have to choose between mate pro and xperia iv mate pro has the advantage over the variable focal length of xperias true zoom lens because of the higher resolution plus variable aperture is more exciting for me
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you guys have no clue how periscope achieves optimal magnification when the quotient factors more understand that you want everyone to understand what periscope is and prove everyone else wrong let me help you with that uhmmmno if you need further assistance with your tantrums please let you mum know
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,good point xperia iv is great example of what true optical zoom actually is as per more seamless zoom works from to mm as digital zoom from to mm as optical zoom and from to mm as digital zoom sony is spot on anyone who thinks that bunch of fixed lenses in triple camera setup can achieve true optical zoom is just incompetent if you have other concerns please dont let me know
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you can take photos with the full resolution with every phone on the whole planet you can swi more on the main camera
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the low mp resolution is problem in all phones today those with or even mp adverti more you can take photos with the full resolution with every phone on the whole planet you can switch between mp binned photos and full resolution photos eg the ultra can take mp binned photos but you can also switch to mp pixels maybe the tele lens on huawei mate pro only offers mp binned photos but all phones allow full resolution photo taking
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,sony is down sony is fail they make only awfull cameras even sony will make better picture than xperia xperia xperia and the hillaroius numbers continue nokia beat everything on this list nokia beat everything after years when somebody will make nokia nokia fusions then will be change in camera departement
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,agree it is pity that sony still uses small main camera sensor with only more the low mp resolution is problem in all phones today those with or even mp advertised resolution are fake as they bin it to mp some phones bin to mp and very few bin to mp think sony will use bigger sensor next year but it will still bin to mp unfortunately
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hopefully one day our phones main camera will have variable focal lengths so we won more good point xperia iv is great example of what true optical zoom actually is as per sonys advertised telephoto zoom lens mm true optical zoom anything that doesnt work as such are fake optical zooms sony even clarifies further on their website seamless zoom works from to mm as digital zoom from to mm as optical zoom and from to mm as digital zoom therefore based on these published facts the optical zoom only applies to the telephoto module the other types of zooming with the telephoto in conjunction with other camera modules are either called hybrid zoom digital zoom or seamless zoom not optical zoom true optical zooming in xperia iv is exclusive to its telephoto zoom lens alone
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,to create that magnification effect cameras use set of moving optical lenses hence more thank you for clarifying using optical zoom to describe fixed lens is misleading therefore this optical zoom thingy they used here is sham however samsung galaxy zoom is the only phone ive seen so far with true zoom lens httpswwwgsmarenacomsamsunggalaxyszoomphp
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,wont be making further comments on this topic as anyone who reads and understands will more to create that magnification effect cameras use set of moving optical lenses hence the name optical zoom gsmarena the way you presented the optical zoom involves two separate fixed lenses so the term optical zoom cant be applied here optical zoomas gsmarena defines itrequires set of moving optical lenses clearly not fixed lens nor it refers to separate lenses source httpswwwgsmarenacomglossaryphptermopticalzoom separate fixed lenses dont qualify as zoom hence the term optical zoom you are referring to in mate pro is just fancy invention and again the right way to write and present lens specs here are few examples as presented by sony and sigma fixed lenses prime lenses no optical zoom whatsoever sony fe mm gm lens sigma mm zoom lenses with real moving optical lenses sigma mm dg dn sony fe mm oss you were teaching me this mp mm periscope telephoto pdaf ois optical zoom when it should be like this mp mm pdaf ois optical zoom should be removed since its fixed lens
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ugly nasty iphone notch ruined it thank you for your sentiment sorry if the product doesnt meet your expectations the mate pros notch houses mp ultrawide and biometrics sensor instead of adding two separate punch holes or pillshaped one small notch was added if you need further help on choosing the right device to purchase cant do that
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,think both of you are referring to different calculations zoom lens basically zooms in more on smartphone as someone mentioned the focal length of the telephoto camera is divided to the focal length of the main to get the optical zoom factor is it the standard way of doing it for decades of photography think someone just made that up actually its not made up research confirms it request you to divide the telephoto lenss of any smartphone by its main sensors focal length and youll get the advertised zoom factor eg ultras mm telephotomm mainx zoom as advertised it works for any phones try it out its quite consistent other than some rounding down also youll find that ultrawide sensor has almost half the focal length of main one mm for su unlike in dslrmirrorless on phones you cant take off and put on lenses on sensor so you have multiple sensors each with different focal lengths for different purpose and main sensor is used as the reference usually mmmm of equivalent focal length and if fact in that case if your fisheye lens is mm and telephoto is mm then indeed its zoom but only as relation between that fisheye lens and telephoto would you really use mm fisheye as reference or rather the standard one which varies between mm mm so lets say your standard lens has mm focal length and telephoto mm then its zoom
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,very funny this is how zoom lens specs should be presented not with some silly telemainu more hopefully one day our phones main camera will have variable focal lengths so we wont need separate telephotoultrawide modules galaxy and zoom design poses many problems for daytoday smartphones which is why its not been carried on but now xperia iv has telephoto camera where the lens moves back and forth in periscope assembly to change focal length and you can do continuous zoom think its actually doable now if they dont mind increasing the phones thickness by some we should be fully for it who wouldnt like to get same quality in their ultrawide and telephoto as main sensor in expense of some added thickness
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,dont force it this is how the phone industry set the specs for the zoom factor it incl more very funny this is how zoom lens specs should be presented not with some silly telemainultrawide focal length division nonsense zoom lens mp mm optical zoom af ois if its fixed mm lens then mm pdaf ois optical zoom the specs only refers to one lens camera module straightforward source httpswwwgsmarenacomsamsunggalaxyszoomphp
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,dont really understand this lens nowadays but will wait for the phone to come out so can try it out myself bc for me the zoom from pro or the mate pro are much better than this one or pro
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,thank you guess you also like to divide the telephotos focal length to the main cam more dont force it this is how the phone industry set the specs for the zoom factor it includes all the camera modules unfortunately thats silly but thats how it is for me cant be fooled by those claimed optical zoom because like you also do this stupid thing called critical thinking
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,man youre so smart everyone wants to be like you thank you guess you also like to divide the telephotos focal length to the main cams thats the smartest thing in the world of photography separate camera modules the same optical zoom wow if thats the case the following statements are all dumb slr lounge for example mm zoom lens would be zoom and mm zoom would be zoom sigma to determine the overall zoom ratio of the lens simply divide the longest focal length by the shortest
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,contacted huawei and confirmed that the zoom factor refers to the wide end of separat more man youre so smart everyone wants to be like you
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,we really need to know what the mm focal length refers to is it the shortest focal length more contacted huawei and confirmed that the zoom factor refers to the wide end of separate lens of the main camera module and the maximum focal length of the separate telephoto lens isnt it marketing tactic to increase the advertised optical zoom its all trickery and marketing therefore in triplecamera setup starting from ultrawide to telephoto you just have to use wide lens with the lowest focal length and add separate telephoto module with high focal length divide the focal length of the telephoto to the wide and there you have seemingly large optical zoom ex wide mm tele mm optical zoom for advertising looking at the huaweis mate pros product page the footnotes confirmed it all its more like scam than actual specs none of these are zoom lenses they are all indeed fixed or prime lenses buying camera lens for your dslr or mirrorless body is different story you would ask for the zoom factor and zoom range the lens specs are engraved on the lens that itself is the proper way of presenting the correct zoom range and focal lengths in all honesty
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,and again the periscope telephoto is zoom lens thats why we have zoom factor more yes of course but please research on this mm focal length is it the actual focal length or the full frame equivalent or is it even the shortest or longest focal length wonder why huawei didnt provide specific detail on this telephoto feature
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,demand you to show evidence form huawei or any official source about mm focal lengt more and again the periscope telephoto is zoom lens thats why we have zoom factor of otherwise its just prime lens if you see lens with zoom factor its zoom lens these are photography basics and can be applied to any lens big or small zoom lenses are called as such because their focal lengths zooms optically it means the focal lengths can extend from the widest to longest based on its design mate pro can achieve zoom because it has periscope telephoto zoom lens thats it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,exactly and in smartphone the longest focal length is the telephoto cameras focal leng more wont be making further comments on this topic as anyone who reads and understands will know whos right
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,who said to multiply the longest focal to the zoom factor thats illogical you are divi more exactly and in smartphone the longest focal length is the telephoto cameras focal length which is mm for matepro my friend selp isnt smartphone camera lens its zoom lens with variable focal length matepros camera doesnt have this feature only few sony phones do on very limited level so here we can only take main camera as the base and telephotos mm focal length as the limit the mm lens simply doesnt exist in matepro in fact sus telephoto has mm focal length so it would be record breaking optical zoom and wouldnt be asking its only lol hope its clesr
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,isnt significant at all with periscope setup yes know quite well that crop fact more you dont get it even zoom factor is nothing when the focal length starts at small number take this lens from sony sel that is zoom lens with zoom factor of since the max focal length is just mm it can be beaten by lens with zoom but with max focal length of anything above mm
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,and may also ask where did you get this idea of multiplying the longest focal length with th more demand you to show evidence form huawei or any official source about mm focal length your claim hence your responsibility of showing evidence here we go again im researching for you for free to answer your questions and again you should contact huawei since they keep patents and designs for their camera systems and again the periscope telephoto is zoom lens thats why we have zoom factor of otherwise its just prime lens zoom lens and prime lenses are different you dont want to divide the max or minimum focal lengths of lenses of two different camera modules and get the zoom factor im out of here since its clear that you dont know how zoom lenses work happen to have three zoom lenses the principles are the same they zoom in and out they have the shortest and longest focal lengths longest focal lengthshortest focal length equals the zoom factor reference to determine the overall zoom ratio of the lens simply divide the longest focal length by the shortestsigma photo lens manufacturer
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,it doesnt matter if its the full frame equivalent the zoom factor is still the sa more isnt significant at all with periscope setup yes know quite well that crop factor the point was making is that some may mistake the equivalent focal length for original one but in fact actual focal lengths in phones are much smaller due to small sensors which means its not as much of struggle to fit in longer focal length for more zoom thats why periscope is common even is achieved on su which even has another telephoto lens
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,rounded down to times optical zoom on pixel pro so mate more and may also ask where did you get this idea of multiplying the longest focal length with the zoom factor from its nowhere to be found except form you yes youre right for first time its zoom but only when compared to ultrawide sensor which is pointless measure remember zoom is only ratio we care about the ration bw main and telephoto not uw and telephoto we can assume that mate pros periscope setup is mm zoom lens thats why we get magnification so according to your claim mate pros telephoto camera can increase its focal length to mm thats simply untrue it would be big news and many articles would be written if it was true only phones with variable focal length are from sony demand you to show evidence form huawei or any official source about mm focal length your claim hence your responsibility of showing evidence
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,very funny the periscope has starting focal length of mm the main cams focal more sorry youre wrong again ive posted clear evidences and calculations already and your calculations are plain wrong unless you put another zoom lens from somewhere on top of that telephoto lens maybe clip on lens from ebay or amazon or aliexpress my calculations are constant with official specifications and mm is nowhere to be found on this phones specs
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,by the way these ones on gsmarena are mm equivalent focal length not actual the formula is more it doesnt matter if its the full frame equivalent the zoom factor is still the same if you look at exif for example we see mm multiply it to the crop factor for conversion for example the exif shows the shortest focal length of the phones telephoto lens is mm zoom factor is that is mm to mm and still translates to zoom multiply these values to the crop factor lets say that still translates to mm to mm zoom factor is still the samex these examples are theoretical but since your original concern is as to why huawei even have to implement periscope setup just to achieve magnification which turned out to be significant number in conjunction with the lens focal length then cant answer that just reach out to huaweis customer support and question the existence of periscope telephoto setup on mate pro
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,except that your working out is wrong again thats not how to find zoom or focal length more rounded down to times optical zoom on pixel pro so mate pros main camera has focal length of mm and telephoto is mm so gsmarena should fix it its not its and for iphone pro max its think they just round it down to nearest or for ultra and times optical zoom where are you getting these idea of dividing the telephotos focal lengths to the main cams focal length these are separate modules separate lenses if thats the case its also correct to divide the longest focal length telephoto to the shortest ultrawide so for huawei mate pro that would be mmmm zoom zoom lenses are often described by the ratio of their longest to shortest focal lengths for example zoom lens with focal lengths ranging from mm to mm may be described as or zoom wikipedia in huawei mate pros case simply assume that the shortest focal length of the telephoto setup is mm then multiply it by so we get the longest focal length of mm therefore based on the specs published on this website we can assume that mate pros periscope setup is mm zoom lens thats why we get magnification that way it makes sense
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,sorry youre doing it wrong thats not the way to multiply for zoom the correct wa more this conversation is pointless just reach out to huaweis customer support and question the existence of periscope telephoto setup on mate pro the periscope setup has to be there since the sensor size for that module doesnt allow for it to be placed in the phone in conventional way the engineers know what theyre doing here unfortunately periscope is simply bunch of mirrors that reflect light thats it nothing fancy
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,since actual focal length is much shorter theres even less excuse for not using longer focal length and hence more zoom
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,more thats huge step above if we start at mm focal length mm more except that your working out is wrong again thats not how to find zoom or focal length correct way is rounded down to times optical zoom on pixel pro so pixel has mm lens in periscope so why mate pro only has mm when periscope allows for much more
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,verry big pricefor this money you can buy asus rog phone and its more good in specifications no rog is for gamers and mate pro is all in one beast if we dont consider gms its second after iphone pro max in this year
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,great specs for phone love the possibiliti to use google services thrue gspace app and you more verry big pricefor this money you can buy asus rog phone and its more good in specifications
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,but this is periscope iphone isnt why need periscope just for more if use periscop more more thats huge step above if we start at mm focal length mm mm add that to and that is mm mm mmmm mm take mm lens with zoom no zoom at all still beats the mm telephoto on pixel pro with zoom
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,im not denying it can zoom more than iphone because vs but here its perisc more it doesnt matter if it can zoom or not what matters is the focal length do the math huawei mate pro mm mm we are getting mm and that qualifies as telephoto lens even phone with zoom with base focal length of mm you still get mm at max zoom even greater than the pixel pro with just google what does optical zoom means and do the multiplication yourself it has to be periscope setup otherwise it wont fit the sensor size aperture focal length and thickness of the phone are all considered in designing these kind of camera systems
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,optical and in maximum with softwarehardware and etc btw iphone pro max has more but this is periscope iphone isnt why need periscope just for more if use periscope it should at least otherwise use non periscope
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,optical zoom seems like small number but if you look at the base focal length of mm more im not denying it can zoom more than iphone because vs but here its periscope on iphone its not but all other phones with periscope has much more zoom its too less for periscope even pixel pro has with periscope
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,whar is this phone support google service
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,one of the issues with huawei is them not having services because of chipset limtation youve no idea
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,mate pro is the best phone ive ever used it did everything and more huawei invented reve more razer phone invented fast refresh rates on phone why copy
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei why the curved screen you should have put the pro option curved screen or flat sc more its better for huawei not for people curved screen means more expensive less protective
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,how can only zoom have need telephoto camera its optical zoom not software based with optimization it can goes to up to httpswwwdigitaltrendscommobilehuaweimateprointernationalrelease
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no one of the issues with huawei is them not having services because of chipset limtation
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no huawei cant get tech because they are still blacklisted from most companies that would supply it to them
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,dont see almost any changes from mate pro same phones with new body it now has more bragging rights than samsung with zoom but thats about it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,only gigs of ram for huawei phones more than enough
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no usa restrictions
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is the selfie new unit any better really after good selfie like in the moto edge ultra just an alternative
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,really wanted this phone to excel with the variable aperture etcbut according to recent youtube review httpsyoutubesbyuhxp unfortunately huawei has few issues to hopefully fix especially with the new variable aperture in some instances along with fov and video low lighthopefully something will come along this year that will somewhat meet their advertised flagship performance and dont really wanted to go the latest apple way if can be avoided
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,and what the dynamic of the new chip just wait and see
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,snapdragon gen is coming at the end of november and what the dynamic of the new chip
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,this is one of the best huawei models that was in the top list the only thing that will have more gms app availability can be reached using gspace app
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,how is snapdragon gen year old snapdragon gen is coming at the end of november
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,it comes with the huawei can now make it yes indeed bloomberg news do after
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,case will be available httpswwwhuaweicentralcommeettheworldsfirstgphonecase
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no google no no wifi no watts chipset months old processor only more how is snapdragon gen year old
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei but the slowest in stable software rollout if huawei werent banned would they st more they are really struggling with this and hope that theyll be back soon so this haters will shut up its annoying how they ask for google nor every time huawei have new device
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,lol alright boss will give you the benefit of the doubt when you say that ios is unmatched unmatch with camera vibration yes it is
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,they have been doing that since fanboy httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweinovaphp huawei was the first to introduce dynamic island in honor view
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no no thank you if had not been invented yet would you ask for it no
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,android not safe guys its very bad experience for realtalk and the absolute irony that harmonyos is androidbased
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,they copied everything next one will have pill hole and dynamic island they have been doing that since fanboy httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweinovaphp
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,whats the purpose of if you could just use wifi anyway is powerhungry unstable more yes
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei capabilities more than you could ever imagine you need to be brave enough to get out of more respect you use huawei phone and tablet and laptop and have very good expeience and ifeel very happy and satisfied
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,think have no idea what are talking about huawei phones are the sturdiest best camera more the rub here is that no company cares about pleasing everyone anymore there are enough fishes in the sea now and confident designs are the best designs but im not complaining that notch means well have the most reliable of huaweis suite of air gestures and having tried them on the mate pro can confirm that they are amazing for convenience and the greatest party trick huawei has ever made in retrospect must have looked pretty dumb walking in rings around the phone watching it orient to my face the entire time
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the notch is back meanwhile apple is eliminating its own in their pro models
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,after seeing some of chinese youtuber videos can say that its really cool phone with nice new features xmage looks promising and photos are amazing as expected from huawei mate cameras takes natural photos and stability is improved over last gen huawei phones am eagerly waiting for global launch
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you android fan boys make laugh was only stating what felt and you guys go and attack me more people dont care less for someones feeling lol
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,iphone is for loosers with no balls terrible hard were and boring and old soft were plus more you android fan boys make laugh was only stating what felt and you guys go and attack me lmao stay pressed
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is gspace safe
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,according the rumor hear that the european launch price will be euros if so the price more it is indeed too much but considering the price of for the iphone pro max value for money is way better
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you mean similar design to mate and mate series on the back and same design as on mate more exactly
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,nokia on the back traditional sharp aquos on the front you mean similar design to mate and mate series on the back and same design as on mate pro at the front
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no this phone is joke its joke cos youve no clue why it is that way
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hate curved screen have mate pro
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you can use youtube vanced apk that is add free and also use any other google app that you wan more when it comes to audio quality which is better youtube vanced or gspace
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,use gspace quality is the same just abit of inconvenience as there will be skippable ad wh more if the audio quality is the same then thats small inconvenience thanks for info
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,reading and comparing the specifications between this mate pro and my pro think more it will never happen bro
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,do you really think that people from spainportugal only make day tho its only half of more dude here in germany provide tutoring to younger students at school and earn per week
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,us banned huawei phones and china didnt ban apple phones either both are built in china
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is the rumor about not being to utilize any google applications on huawei true there is no any rumor its the truth since please upgrade your techno info as soon as possible
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is there way to use youtube official app on harmonyos the audio quality will be lower compa more you can use youtube vanced apk that is add free and also use any other google app that you want using gspace
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei nova support google play store kirin new chipset processor wifi quick charging watts dual operating system date
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hes lucky in germany even the poorest make euros in half an hour on average where more do you really think that people from spainportugal only make day tho its only half of germany its still eur and btw im still high school student so make like week also in my previous post only focused on the price
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,was big fans of huaweis mate series since mate pro and now im still using more just get gspace and all google apps run
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,well see the global launch on september give us fair price huawei
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,httpswwwhuaweicentralcomustoeasehuaweisanctionsscaredoflosingleadintechnology
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,just think is speed enough to download or send average content like movies games or something like that is also good but think that it is not enough not to buy this powerful and convenient phone with new operation system and excellent cameras in my opinion huawei is second places in making smartphones it is obvious who is in the first
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,what bad decision to make iphone notch
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,youre lucky in germany gb contract costs eu and the best is that in my part of tow more hes lucky in germany even the poorest make euros in half an hour on average where he lives they make euros in whole day hes really lucky
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,so what is the difference with and can perform as well certain task and more connect more it depends in what country you live in my country has places with and no but thats not the point of my comment my point is about the average consumer they will look at the bigger number and think its better just by seeing instead of those people are simple and when they see bigger number it equals to better in their mind my point since the first comment has been about the average consumer who doesnt understand lot about tech
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,my comment mainly applies to portugal and spain also in portugal plans arent more ex more so what is the difference with and can perform as well certain task and more connection available you people are just going with the trend lol
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,will goggle play services work with this phone no because it hasnt got androidus ban
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the average consumer cares if someone who doesnt have that much knowledge about tech more not sure what part of europe are you talking about havent used my option on the phone for the past two year germanyitalyfrance plans are either super expensive or suffer horrible coverage
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,so emui is on the bag wonder when it will be available to other devices so excited
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,btw guys you can take photo in different apertures thats cool feature and really want to taste it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,your flat out wrong if you check tech companies huawei are in only if you search smartph more huawei really knows how to make phones and its pity this suppression because of geopolitics still got my pro mate from years ago yes years ie had no reason to change it and believe me its the best phone ive ever held in the palm of my hands in terms of interface battery longevity etc
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,so whats happens in when we finally get mate pro in mate pro sounds dumb mate will redebut kirin chips
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hey you can side load the google play store apk file into the phone yourself and it will be more dual space app which works fine tired on my huawei nova every thing is working fine can excess to google play store download app download the app from offical website but you will get see ads
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,they are number go check wikipedia before posting rubbish your flat out wrong if you check tech companies huawei are in only if you search smartphones companies is when huawei enters the top being in number spot the data have is from wikipedia data is from huaweis influence in the market and value has decreased lot compared with last year also dont take me as an huawei hater own pro and still really like it but its just fact that huawei has lost lot of influence over the smartphone market to the point that competitors dont see huawei as threat anymore
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,well its practical to people who want to protect their device while having except every other phones already have built in also wont be able to change cases without losing the its not pratical
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,most persons dont use their phone without case anyway so it can be seen as practical except people buy cheap cases if the case is more than dont see people buying it it will also be more thick because of the and still dont see it being practical since most other phones even cheap phones include build in
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,iphone pro max huawei mate pro
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,weird that there is no videos or promotion on huawei youtube pages even chineseasian youtubers has not released video of it am so curious about this device
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ugly only mother could love haha and you would know this first handbut dont worry there are others alike
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,nice phone but lack of google play services hey you can side load the google play store apk file into the phone yourself and it will be okay did this for my xiaomi mi back in as my unicom wcdma version didnt have the google play store and also for china region huawei ascend my parents had youll be fine
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the fact that it doesnt have google play services
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,looks cool
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the phone looks beautiful dont mind the notch actually prefer notch on iphone more good comment
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,one more thing also got little mixed up and wrote rudely respect your comment and more its ok friend
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,because the quality of the under display cameras are still absolutely garbage okbut who said for example the phone zte axon ultra the quality of the camera is excellent because compared it with ultra and zte won the game in fact the argument is that the selfie camera notch is almost related to the renaissance era
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,thats the only thing you can do and say this one is too much for all brands and you will see more have phones each pair is huawei why did you think dont like huawei love this brand only the design of the front of the phone reminds me of mate pro which is for hoping for huawei to be the best again
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,according to this video does this mate pro only have loudspeakers on the bottom like the more the speaker has moved to an iphone configuration where the grille is facing you indeed downgrade but it definitely has stereo speakers
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,too bad you believe in ram size too much does not affect any performance rather throwing more advised you not to speak because you do not understand any thing and you are saying laughty words stop spesking until you understand any thing
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,old and ugly design my dear huawei what design was this thought the notch design more thats the only thing you can do and say this one is too much for all brands and you will see how and mate will destroy them so better to respect any brandok
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ugly or beauty is in the eye of the beholder own huawei and have no problem with the ye hole at the front of the hp after some time you dont even remember it exists anyway one buys the hp based mainly on its price affordability and function not just how it looks
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,youre living under the rock its been years still kirin outforms sd an more only huawei saleswoman say that
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,kirin bad overheats like exynos youre living under the rock its been years still kirin outforms sd and bionic
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,better than iphone pro max
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you say nothing like your iphone and try to justify the week points in the iphone by nothing more too bad you believe in ram size too much does not affect any performance rather throwing chrome tabs and apps leaving in background gb is bare minimum nowadays gb and is enough phones aint pc leave the ipad alone you mentioned last time
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ipads are meant for multitasking and it deserves well for of ram with its chipset unli more you say nothing like your iphone and try to justify the week points in the iphone by nothing words keep silent better until you understsnd what you say there is no one in the world can agree that the and ram can work better than and ram
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,too bad for huawei great phones but lacking google store and when will this us sanction end more its already more than two years of this issue and none of you cant move on if your slave of google then why bother coming here saying the same stuff for more than two years you cant even but so why bother
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,need to advise that smartphone is compatible with with protective case designed special by huawei for me is great excellent shot made by huaweii knew that information at mwc in barcelona and corroborated in ifa berlin
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,its amazing work huawei
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,mate pros notch is much better looking than this and no more waterfall display worst design ever
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,apple has different os which is ios so they dont need too much ram as long it works while more are you sure of what are you saying if you are true why apple uses ram in their pad despite using the same operating system if this will add nothing why they use it again apple uses ram in their laptops despite using aspecial os the matter is that apple tries to save every one dollar on the expense of the cosumer because the company that sells more than millions devices yearly will save million dollars for each one dollar
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ugly design xiaomi ultra is more better
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,that is beauty wish they were able to produce more kirin chips kirin bad overheats like exynos
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ip dustwater resistant up to for mins really dont think so it can be drowned in meters and all ip resistances regardless of brand are nothing just costly gimmick not worth to have because any waterproof case doesa lot better job
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the wait is finally here
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,correction to your comment and also adding some info to it st those pre bookings more they are number go check wikipedia before posting rubbish
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,so many years in and huawei still cant go with the times stop copying apple alread more how are they copying apple
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,another conspiracy theorist on the loose from claiming that causes covidto it being more said what meant very clearly just do what said consistently and see the result
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,what is that notch its ridiculous were not in anymore huawei
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,performant front facing camera unlock option better than finger unlock option now iphone has an serious opponent dont know why samsung renounced of this optioni had galaxys but tof front camera is keeping to buy iphones
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,is it camera its has on the back or am missing something the fourth ring is an laser autofocus
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,think it is great for company to offer these specs despite the us restrictins huawei is more apple has different os which is ios so they dont need too much ram as long it works while android are different universe oems can do whatever they want you see devices starting from to gb of ram but it is useless to have gb of ram if it has helio
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ugly design almost no phones have middle top camera placement its always has top left placement which is boring and repetitive and yet you called this ugly please check your eyes right
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,either tof sensor or just cutout for symmetry and not cam or sensor at all it aint tof sensor its just there for camera design
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,wow and they come up with this guess they dont care anymore they are just making anything for fun
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,no only no wifi expensive cover bundle together with the phonesame as pro will brings you about wifi still dont know its privileges so its my first choice to buy at the moment
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,having case to just have is not practical especially cause other phones already have more well its practical to people who want to protect their device while having
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,there have been over pre bookings for this phone so far as of week ago so how is more correction to your comment and also adding some info to it st those pre bookings are in china where google doesnt matter the mate is china only for now nd huawei isnt even in the top ten biggest tech companies in the world they are in
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,you think it could kill you maybe no but stupidity might
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,maybe the th camera module that you see is laser auto focus
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,huawei will be offering case with the phone having case to just have is not practical especially cause other phones already have built into them without needing case
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,with out google huawei flop item it wont be complete flop because of the chinese market where they dont have google but yeah dont see it selling very well in other markets
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,bruh that notch but why tho dont mind it but why go back to notch when the previous generation mate pro upgraded from notch to pill punchhole overall like it just confusing and irrational front design choice
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,kinda ugly if you ask me why does it have notch instead of punch hole
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,where is the new design shame on you huawei no better camera setup is that news from huawei after year ive been waiting for something new disappointed pity so pity
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,in europe they kinda are my country has coverage but its submmw it more can you verify to me what is the big advantage of over youre really hyping so if scamsung nor apple decide to upgrade to which is not going to happen anyway since huawei was first to plan for are you going to look for huawei devices as well youre just kid who wants to go with the trend lol
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,why some people angry just because no like its world wide avaible with mbps isnot enough for instagram facebook youtube typical daily average person use absolutly fine itisenough yes it should be better priced at it would be amazing bit its not deal breaker sorry for bad english
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,its great that it doesnt have if you think is safe then please put one more you think it could kill you
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,alexfufayev sep to pay for this phone without is good enough and not all areas having so whats your point as long as it works fine and fast who cares about
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,using my mate pro nd dont think this mate series is worth the upgrade wonder more they cant actually push forward due to sanction think you should know it by now they are working their ass off to compete with the other brands with google play store with limited ways
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,looking at the camera specs the telescopewish can buy this beauty
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ugly design
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,ulol sep lol as if your whole country is covered with in europe they kinda are my country has coverage but its submmw its kinda funny since the series was and it worked here the newer huawei models dont even have antennaemodems huawei is really uncompetitive and too expensive for what it offers in europe
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,which th company what are you talking about who remembers huawey except you and few more you remember huaweis phones lot because you spend your time everyday commenting on huawei phones
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,good specs but they should reduce the prices xiaomi ultra will beat this phone in all the aspects with the same price or little bit lower if huawei can sell this phone with euros they will compete with others
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,google play
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,am the only one here looking at the word xmage in the specifications leica caused this one
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,wow its the screen look like mate pro
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,that display design is something
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,someone give me information in the on bds satellite message can video calls be made is it used as the internet
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,hi can someone please clarify something this mate pro has optical zoom does this mea more theyve barely been released wait for the reviews
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,due to us restrictions huawei cannot upgrade its mobile features honor magic pro is better than huawei mate pro in all aspects including ltpo display ultrasonic fp sensor punch hole camera etc huawei has to step up or else it will swallowed by other mobile competitors
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the battery is small disappointed
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,to pay for this phone without
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,solid
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,the most ugliest andriod of the year
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,then king is back
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,so this thing has sd plus gen but sadly mean its okay is not the best in but still its not bad
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,deleted post there have been over pre bookings for this phone so far as of week ago so how is it rip they are the th biggest tech company in the world what on earth are you talking about
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,beautiful and stunning phone really love it
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,deleted post dude
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,woooooow
Huawei,Mate 50 Pro,its really nice to see with gen lets see the global launch and price then we can discuss about mate series
Huawei,Mate 50,mate and mate pro still have oveaheating issue since series just take pictures more the best phone using pubg no lagg camera the best sound amazing still relevant this
Huawei,Mate 50,hello guys needed to ask if this phonemate can activate volte calls because there is no option for it within the settings thank you
Huawei,Mate 50,you are lying about everything awesome camera no heating problems only problem is the softw more mate and mate pro still have oveaheating issue since series just take pictures or videos for minute and then its start kicking in no hdr process not working portrait and aperture mode
Huawei,Mate 50,one piece of advice from me after using it for months dont buy mate ive been using more you are lying about everything awesome camera no heating problems only problem is the software dont take this in the wrong way no google is an issue for lot of apps especially in india for banking apps wish huawei introduce their payment service everywhere and native apps for huawei from meta all banking apps
Huawei,Mate 50,is satelittemessaging available in europa
Huawei,Mate 50,wish could afford any of the mate range own an huawei nova it takes great photos the screen is really good the mono speaker is loud with good depth of sound without installing any google obtaining apps space box or so ive heard lighthouse can access my gmail youtube etc and using petal search can obtain any app may need am not great fan of google in the sense that need it day to day in fact have no need of anything else as all need can be found in thr huawei app store petal maps is improving daily and in many respects already surpasses google maps having said all that would like mate it probably has face unlock and screen fingerprint unlock like my nova but has better camera tech zooming shots
Huawei,Mate 50,read the feature of the pro version and found that do not need the feature on the pro version so this is good for me at the price point
Huawei,Mate 50,no face id
Huawei,Mate 50,can anyone tell does the main camera have ois according information from official site no
Huawei,Mate 50,does google authentication notification prompt on huawei devices when installed lighthouse or gbox
Huawei,Mate 50,if huawei has google will use it for the rest of my life until die huawei official here actually promote new app called lighthouse which can use google apps
Huawei,Mate 50,concerns about google availability then sideload gspace via petal search search how on youtube
Huawei,Mate 50,any news for europe launch if huawei has google will use it for the rest of my life until die
Huawei,Mate 50,okay this is the term to describe fake optical zoom on smartphone multicam zoom meaning bunch of separate fixed lenses on multicam phone with varying focal lengths working together to achieve zoom multicam zoom when marketed as optical zoom becomes marketing bs source stop calling it optical zoom when the optics dont zoom httpspocketnowcomsmartphoneopticalzoom read before you post search before you post your question is probably already answered since
Huawei,Mate 50,so according to some view from separate sensor with longer focal length resulting in same more cant continue presenting arguments backed by sources have some work to do if you deny my comments you also deny wikipedias explanation of zoom lenses also responding to the topic of fake optical zoom presented as true optical zoom is not worth your time as added several users to my element blocker cant read what you said as they are all redacted including avatars
Huawei,Mate 50,were talking about lenses fixed and zoom fixed lenses are fixed cant zoom optically zoom lenses as seen on xperia ivs telephoto can actually perform optical zoom marketing phone with optical zoom even though it lacks this technology is misleading scam and good for profit telling the truth about how true optical zoom works to the public is actually hurting the sales of their products do you want to sell more of these understand
Huawei,Mate 50,you think you posting your bs from multiple accounts impresses me try harder in case you missed here are some gsmarena posting rules read before you post search before you post your question is probably already answered please no foul language be polite and use common sense
Huawei,Mate 50,lol in that case tell gsmarenas team to edit dozens of pages with phones specs particul more no need to edit the entries dont know if you can read but gsmarena clearly states under each and every spec sheet disclaimer we can not guarantee that the information on this page is correct bye
Huawei,Mate 50,cool story bru now why dont you tell that to hundreds of youtube reviewers gsmarena in more bye
Huawei,Mate 50,dont know if you can read but sonys true optical zoom lens is different becau more cool story bru now why dont you tell that to hundreds of youtube reviewers gsmarena included
Huawei,Mate 50,theres no such thing as fake optical zoom its either optical zoom or more dont know if you can read but sonys true optical zoom lens is different because until now nearly every optical zoom capability on smartphone would be more accurately described as fake optical zoom source monckton paul sony beats apples iphone with radical new smartphone technology forbes may what does it mean its just way to describe the marketing lingo optical zoom hope this is clear
Huawei,Mate 50,dont know if you can read notafanboy but it turns out youre re more you think you posting your bs from multiple accounts impresses me try harder
Huawei,Mate 50,its clear youre an ad hominem and deserves no more of my time nothing you say are more lol in that case tell gsmarenas team to edit dozens of pages with phones specs particularly those which happen to have telephoto
Huawei,Mate 50,enjoy your fake optical zoom theres no such thing as fake optical zoom its either optical zoom or digital zoom get it
Huawei,Mate 50,oh yes big deal because they said instead of digital wow ar more enjoy your fake optical zoom
Huawei,Mate 50,lol comes from huaweis website itself under telephoto image that theyve more oh yes big deal because they said instead of digital wow are you bored
Huawei,Mate 50,huawei make really good phones and can only be compared to apple in terms of quality even samsung is no match
Huawei,Mate 50,and again thats fake optical zoom the mm lens has fixed focal length so that more dont know if you can read but even on this page it says optical zoom dunno where you got from
Huawei,Mate 50,is it big deal that the device does not support yeah sure but huawei might make case with support as huawei did with series
Huawei,Mate 50,this ones bit more sensible to provide periscope telephoto instead of mere on the pro one but that ones got mp over the resolution of this allowing some hybrid zoom lets see which ones better actually
Huawei,Mate 50,wellleica where are you leica is done with huawei so the series was the last to feature their cam tech
Huawei,Mate 50,can any one tell me which maximum zoom capability and clarity between ppro plus and mate in both photo and zoom mode as their prices are both close
Huawei,Mate 50,lol when the nonpro model looks better than the pro
Huawei,Mate 50,huawei should have used mp sensors for both periscope and ultrawide cameras its really enjoyable to take landscape photos at higher resolutions but this device and the pro model think are more exciting than iphone series and xiaomis upcoming devices with mpmpmp camera systems
Huawei,Mate 50,gsmarena will wait your verdict about this celphone camera please get review about it abd prove it to us that this is worth of trying to buy without gsm
Huawei,Mate 50,thank you huawei for keeping our hope alive knew huawei soon will returning bigger better and stronger message to the us no matter how hard the wind blows the mountain cannot bow to it
Huawei,Mate 50,does mate has google play store no
Huawei,Mate 50,the word in our generations to day is just like mp camera that are coming its way just hypedg is still lot to improve
Huawei,Mate 50,pro plus has optical zoom which else has this or more mate pro has screen to body ratio which else has that or more apart ftom honor magic ultra that has
Huawei,Mate 50,the sensor uses an imx similar to the galaxy regular version its bit small since the ultra uses sensor bit higher then theres the xiaomi mi pro with larger sensor than the samsung ultra but not by lot it is then theres the xiaomi ultra which has inch sensor so the huawei mate sensor is the smallest out of all but hopefully with their new ximage processing and variable aperture the pictures could come out decent
Huawei,Mate 50,well this could have been good phone with google play services and with at least it doesnt have that stupid notch unlike that mate
Huawei,Mate 50,since most countries still runs on and speeds on some countries are weather dependable its not big issue anyway is fast enough and this phone is outstanding
Huawei,Mate 50,this phone its pro sibling are great but still at hopefully theres breakthro more this phone will come with phone case with enabled but need to purchase separately
Huawei,Mate 50,hey dude for one totally agree with you on this thing was hoping for the older kirin say the or as it doesnt matter at all to me as they seem superior which is better is it mate or the pro plus bcos the price is almost the same here with only difference of around us how about giving another opinion for the mate pro vs the pro plus too
Huawei,Mate 50,pricey but pretty nice phone
Huawei,Mate 50,hz and thats crazy huawei cant proud of these series everything is old and except chip setup
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,nice phone how to buy online and where to buy aliexpress
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,why to buy mate porsche design web mate pro plus yplus jave and periskope telephotoevdrything else is te sameso mate apd is downgrade compering to ps
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,just display short
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,how are they able to get snapdragon isnt the company banned for silicone chips only the modemsat least for now
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,how they are still getting snapdragon
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,dont even matter my country is so behind that youll be lucky to get in some more its better to find way to immigrants one europe country
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,mp main and mp ultrawide every midranger has it maybe it is bit better than on most more huawei has mp main this is less than lenovo legion mp its easily done get so excited over the main camera you forget they all stalemate each other anyway the problems most smartphone have is there so hyper focused on main camera the selfie camera often get neglected if youre truly after good camera probably the asus zenfone flip is best flagship with good camera last years lenovo legion pro was also good yes lot of mid reach smartphone do have flagship cameras this is true saw budget smartphones with main camera that are interesting and its impressive camera basically mid range is way too go if youre after camera pay the extra for more performance realistically this just smartphone with fancy cool name after nice car really just smartphone for rich people too show off as said before higher price tag dont always mean better dont get your expectations too high based only on premium pricing
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,in you have the chance to use network yes man you have agree on that but as long as your data are limited you wont use them for updates for running youtube videos etc maybe for chat via facebook messenger viber twitter whatsapp and some not very data csotly games when you have not limited data is viable for example have gb every month for data but at home always switch to wifi and live in slovakia where most towns already have and using mi mi lite phone usualy end every month with like gb out of gb left
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,saw camera samples of lenovo legion its cameras are godlike the lenovo legion more mp main and mp ultrawide every midranger has it maybe it is bit better than on most midrangers but it will never be even close to huawei
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,huwei playing arround with his own expensive toys have never seen any of these expensive more maybe you should say india my anonyms team lol
Huawei,Mate 50 RS Porsche Design,they dont even have telephoto modules there is no flagship without telecamera they more saw camera samples of lenovo legion its cameras are godlike the lenovo legion is camera phone just look how many crazy many cameras it has and so high mp on top this huawei is just luxury smartphone for rich people but its no better then pound smartphone is the point am trying too make
Huawei,Mate 50E,the price and availability are important
Huawei,Mate 50E,bruh would prefer the as the samsung isnt so bad with that price can get of more yeah bro
Huawei,Mate 50E,is mate isnt snap cut down to
Huawei,Mate 50E,how can you even compare phones from different generations what im saying is that samsung should have given their version the same treatment at the time
Huawei,Mate 50E,no connectivity rather prefer the sony xperia iv
Huawei,Mate 50E,nice trick only cameras but the camera island makes believe its cameras sure these pictures belong to the regular as it appears to have telephoto module and lacks it time will tell
Huawei,Mate 50E,no its not you can get superior performance motorola edge pro with snapdragon more yeah too bad that camera underperforms pretty badly
Huawei,Mate 50E,basically the same phone as the vanilla mate but without the periscope telephoto camera and more no its not you can get superior performance motorola edge pro with snapdragon for and zoom camera and the rest of the setup and superior display
Huawei,Mate 50E,snapdragon or
Huawei,Mate 50E,have to applaud huawei as this mate is light years better than the se that samsung rel more how can you even compare phones from different generations
Huawei,Mate 50E,
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,why cause its not it remained chinaonly
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,lol never why
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,when is it coming to uk hoped huawei mate pro comes lol never
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,does that mean its satellite connectivities only works in china it was not glob more according to the notes on the phone the satellite connection is to tiantong satellite communications and satellite calls have maximum duration of minutes
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,gsmarena take correct huawei doesnt use lipo batteries on their flagships they only use liion and lipo in the budget and midrange phones
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,seen this phone an amazon im in jamaica and saw that it got some bad reviews and more yh its fake unit not real
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,huawei has released new version of harmony os its size is gb
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,harmony os in an android aospbased os much like any custom android variant on other phones hos next ditches aosp
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,they are bringing harmony os next this fall no worries doogle apps are for android users harmony os in an android aospbased os much like any custom android variant on other phones
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,if huawei doesnt bring back google on their device then thats doesnt make sense they are bringing harmony os next this fall no worries doogle apps are for android users
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,so this phone basically has sd level performance with heat management to match gen performance with good heat management
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,why still no review its not the first china only phone which was reviewed here before
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,you should see in the smartphone camera section if in selfie section it would show honor ma more received this morning the firmware update harmony which is stated to improve the performance of the cameras
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,did huawei excluded from dxomark because when search the honor magic pro on dxomark it more you should see in the smartphone camera section if in selfie section it would show honor magic pro in first rank
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,antutu cant measure smt hyper threading in chip kirin is no soc with smt more is huawei still better option than other brands
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,antutu less than sd gen non with mill dmark stability lmao hua more antutu cant measure smt hyper threading in chip kirin is no soc with smt implemented boosting in performance on par with nm and nm gen in work hands on test pc proved
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,this form factor is what always wantedwidth close to mm but no gservices same thing with me if this is what you want then recommend you to buy the vivo note it has width of mm and has google services the only problem is that vivo has still not released an updated version of it since so this means that you will still be stuck with the outdated snapdragon gen chipset
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,the chipset of this phone has its antutu gpu score released and its just around more optimization is what huawei really needs if they want to squeeze out every power from the kirin the chipset is really that new and benchmarks doesnt always tell the whole phone performance but am more inclined on how stable their performance are huawei got stability score of if the sensor got only around then that is dead cameras on the huawei are the best but this phone is just to overpriced but buying second hand one is nice deal second hand huawei mate pro can cost between usd
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,regarding the huawei mate dont think you understand mobile phones kunlun glass is more kunlun glass is on par with the gorilla glass am inclined for jerryrigeverything to test the kunlun glass to settle on the argument whether huawei really made glass stronger than gorilla
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,until now no respectable youtube reviewer touched this phone only small channels paid by chin more man another flat earther must be tough year mate here drink water for hydration
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,should get the mate pro or the plus version noticed that the no plus has more battery more just get the pro version the changes on the plus version arent significant
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,from premium company this phone is absolute garbage huawei has no idea what th more obviously this guy just got his comment from reddit hahhahhh
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,the hot pixel says hello as well
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro,the processor isnt made by tsmc but chinese one instead forced by us sanctions they more theyre the only premium end smartphones that dont have their processors made by tsmc samsung says hello
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the mp selfie camera is huge step back for the mate series compared to the mate pro which was ahead of its time wish huawei kept the design and features of the mate pro for its future versions lets see what they will do with the mate series this year
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,like huge screen have mate been using for years just bought ultra for better camera but im not happy with smaller screen it means keyboard is smaller so more typos plus little more eye strain why are so few really large screen phones made
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,is it yes are you blind
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,better to fly there and buy it is it
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no more sim setlite calling is bestbye bye signal problems
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,try to order in huawei official website how can order it at same price in australia in china its being sold for but here in australia on websites like aliexpress or ebay people are selling for
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,hello guys where can buy the mate pro plus fromonline thank you try to order in huawei official website
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,in of the market even in china they are well passed by honor huawei more relax you are the one who should focus on other things
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,huawei removing the ability to sideload apps makes these phones doa outside china if they werent already
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,in my experience with this phone would say that in daily bases it performs great it is jus more but this phone also has video demo that shows it moving thru different heavy games with no problem and refresh its more than enough proof to validate what you experienced
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,awesome phone worth all the troubles getting the gb tb model now realize why some coun more true us is just projecting when they accused huawei back then now they cant rebuild their cia network in china which was previously destroyed by cpc haha
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no wifi maybe on promax
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,choose infinix budget friendly
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,it looks unfortunately maybe the will have global launch no wifi
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no word on possible global release for the mate series most likely they wont be re more it looks unfortunately maybe the will have global launch
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,nice result but sadly not release in globally its for china only or can order to ali express
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,its interesting that its in the dxomark test will it be released globally or more no word on possible global release for the mate series most likely they wont be released globally in the end
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yea good machine want to buy the huawei mate pro plus pls link me with buyer
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,is it support esim
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,it is satellite phone too
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no its huawei flagship phone its china only so that probably why they didnt bother to make the model
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,nah they dont make models for every phone no its huawei flagship phone
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,why no review gsmarena
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no model nah they dont make models for every phone
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,wellthen the name is much more cooler huawei mate pro vs huawei mate pro dude its just plus at the end it doesnt sound in any way cooler
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yeah but those scores look weird the mate pro scored lower than the regular mate with more in my experience with this phone would say that in daily bases it performs great it is just super fast and super reliable am really heavy multitasker open large documents super big pdf files over plus calls from my business partners and investors everyday bitcoin apps stock apps lot of banking apps plus hours of business meetings through microsoft teams everyday and lot more and fun fact is that dont even close all of these apps while am handling these tasks every single day according to the real persons experience who used the phoneto be honest to tell the truth the numbers aka benchmarks like antutu geekbench and etc doesnt matter in daily bases unless you are phone gamer
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,wheres the cooler desii theyre basically nearly the same especially in design wellthen the name is much more cooler huawei mate pro vs huawei mate pro
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,made mistake on the gpu score checked another source the exact score is not conf more dont know why im back here but here am the antutu score is released and yeah the gpu score is there which brings the antutu score to around quite underwhelming for todays standards httpsnanoreviewnetensochisiliconkirins
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the pro plus has more cooler design than the regular pro version wheres the cooler desii theyre basically nearly the same especially in design
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yeah like said no big difference the pro plus has more cooler design than the regular pro version
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post keep believing in photoshopped photos
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yes im in living in somewhere in asia hope they will export it to the eu
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,can playing dokkan battle without using third party app to run dont have mate series but just saw many hongkong mate pro user intall and run many apps in google shop apksure with gspace gbox etc without problem on hk forum huawei also have in huawei appgallery all these help mate pro to install and run most of android app only the app which use google pay cannot run normally
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,looks interesting assume you are in asia because its very hard to get one here yes im in living in somewhere in asia
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,bought this phone several weeks ago and to be honest with you it performs great im more looks interesting assume you are in asia because its very hard to get one here
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,kirin is transformed from sever huawei cpu so it does multitask well the huawei more can playing dokkan battle without using third party app to run
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,nice hows the camera performance the auto mode photos from all three cameras are really good the colors details and everything is just top level one tradeoff is that the tele cameras detail level is worse than pro but it has now telemacro mode which is just insane conventional macro mode in smartphones uses their ultra wide camera to focus the close subject but the mate uses the tele camera to focus close objects and the details from it just crushes the other phones macro mode which was taken with the ultra wide angle camera like the pro night time cityscape photos from all three cameras overexposes the highlights but despite that it performs great in low light environments and also in the super low light environments the phone can see what even my eyes cant see the photos come out noise free with plenty of details and uplifted shadows with an overall bright expose as always like the predecessors the phone turn night into day the portrait photos are really good can safely say that this phone has one of the most best portrait cameras in the market right now the edge detection and the details are superior the video performance is overall ok the phone can record up to fps and there is plenty of detail the colors are saturated with good dynamic range there is hdr vivid option and it works in and in but only in fps in all resolutions no matter the aspect ratio hdr vivid mode gives you more vibrant colors and slightly better hdr processing did not shoot the moon shots yet so cant tell if it is improved the selfie camera also performs fine it comes out crisp with little bit underexposed brightness the downgrade from the pro is that they removed the af in selfie camera and like in the rear cameras the portraits come out solid in my experience the overall camera performs exceptionally good
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,in your dreams the kirin is outdated chipset and the performance is more like sd bought this phone several weeks ago and to be honest with you it performs great im really really heavy multitasker user but the phone is fast reliable powerful enough to handle my daily task and does not throttle at all personally am not phone gamer because play all games on my ps literally dont play or install single game on my phone yes the chipset is outdated but it performs good thanks to the software optimizations gb ram gb internal storage super fast and super responsible display and whole lot more additionally if you dont play games on your phone you dont need the latest and the cutting edge super powerful chipsets specs are not all in specs does not mean to much this is the real experience from who used the phone for several weeks
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,sure and if you want the kirin to actually match the performance of the gen then it more dont think so you are just talking for nothing
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,you guys are all wrong not everything about phone is cpu speeds it is about how well ever more everyones experiences will be different some will prefer huawei over samsung and vice versa processors speeds really dont matter all that much as you said all modern mobile cpus are incredibly fast and efficient for any application also as you mentioned lots of gsmarena commenters love to dwell on numbersspecs and some believe the current kirin cpu to be the best performing one when it really isnt when you compare it in benchmarks in terms of software thats subjective category
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,its that bad majority of users here are all about numbers here but are suspiciously qui more your only substituting google spyware for huawei spyware its always pick your poison case for any smartphonetablets now
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post in your dreams the kirin is outdated chipset and the performance is more like sd
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,how much is huawei mate pro phone why hasnt the price update yet in here because it is currently china only
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,sdg performs better but its still heating in some stress conditions sure and if you want the kirin to actually match the performance of the gen then itll run even hotter then the notorious gen or
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post nice video composed only of very low quality screenshots which can easily be faked and manipulated by photoshop from channel with low count subscribers great reliable source may be someone will post snapdragon gen video with an antutu score of million ill be sure to believe any video on youtube
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,not on the latest snapdragon gen all cpu lines have had overheating issues in the past more sdg performs better but its still heating in some stress conditions
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,why have qualcomm with endless problems nowadays dont worry about the benchmarks because more you can try keep justifiying that qualcomm is worse the latest snapdragon dont even overheat and the performance is much better and has much more support even if gen or overheats they perform better and they run incredibly well or maybe too well for thermals the numbers dont lie not saying kirin is bad but it isnt as good as you guys say it to be with all the gimmick marketing
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,but it will never last as long as kirin in battery life and performance the absolutely dominates the on top of that apple has longer software support compared to huawei the longeitvity is it out of the question better
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,great materials on paper but in practical environment it doesnt compare at all to snapdragon more why have qualcomm with endless problems nowadays dont worry about the benchmarks because what use is phone that can only do that performance for short while before overheating in real life performance test your brain wont even realize there is difference kirin chips has always been very reliable and performance wise great
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,you an employee of huawei you keep saying all these marketing gimmicks as if to sell their ha more qualcomm is like making audi with plastic waterpump its wont last kirin is very very reliable dont even look at benchmarks anymore real life usage proves everything
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,even the pro got cores less and it beats the it overheats but itll still easily more but it will never last as long as kirin
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,and thats good just some people on this site praise this cpu as if its going to be the top con more according to benchmarks yes but real life usage proves otherwise
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,bruh huawei is its infancy stage on creating their own socs without western help due to more and thats good just some people on this site praise this cpu as if its going to be the top contender which its not kirin could definitely be top cpu line in the future but time will tell as apples soc has been the top for long while
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,thin qualcomm should solve their overheating problems if they dont they will more even the pro got cores less and it beats the it overheats but itll still easily beat the kirin
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,why no include nearlink in the connection
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post oflimnot sony imxthats what heard still wonder whats the rest nonchinabrand parts of pro is sk hynix ram and nand and what
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the score of antutu is far enough mil to be on par with gen and only diffe more you an employee of huawei you keep saying all these marketing gimmicks as if to sell their hardware to more people the real antutu scores prove that kirin is an inferior chip with special materials compared to qualcomm these leaked scores mean nothing until they actually post em
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,joke of the year do you even have one joke is yourself
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post great materials on paper but in practical environment it doesnt compare at all to snapdragon gen or even the gen another tensor situtation its all marketing gimmicks and the scores prove kirin needs more time to bake in the huawei headquaters
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,amazing review of the phone httpswwwyoutubecomliverkayfvzeosibvhmpemlyoebvd joke of the year
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post thanks for sharing
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,its seems the kirin after software unlocked cpus have cpu score
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,downgrade from mate pro
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,come on huawei release phone like honor max with huge display love huge screens so wh more the huawei mate had bigger screen the honor max
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post amazing review of the phone httpswwwyoutubecomliverkayfvzeosibvhmpemlyoebvd
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,its seems that antutu score is mil exact number is wheres the source for that though
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,my problem is if china has so many restrictions how would they actually be able to create more if you would be in tech you would or should know cameras running on all brands laptops tablets as well too oh the chipset is produced from other country industry machine iphone is manufactured and assembled in china if you want to know and their data collecting server is in china as well not in the us hope these things helps bit to see things bit more clear have good day
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,another question is if this huawei phone is so secure that the ciafbi cant trace more they all collect your data the question is where does it harm you the least at least not the chinese government but if youre ok with that no problemo senor
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post as any huawei phones maximum years updates
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,dr watson sep clock speed performance chip can have high clock speed and still run like garb mate pro can say only one word wooow and thank you huawei love apply product but no so good improvement in their product this is good as customer user because it will create compaction between companies who can give more options and good theology
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,observe that there is lot of fear on the part of the us government about huaweis gre more huawei is generations ahead of iphone series but consoomers flock over it must be nice to have geniuses who can pull off stunts like boasting type usb port like it was just invented last week by apple
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,youre right retract my statement about the chip no problem mate
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the chipset has been obtained from smic using systems not dependent on the us and not from ta more youre right retract my statement about the chip
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,just making sure in case you didnt look this phone is like to years old and the more it is the performance and functionality of the phone that counts the process nodes of the semiconductors used to fabricate these components eg soc cannot be used as direct indicator of the phone performance please do not show your ignorance unless you have some benchmarks to substantiate your claims
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,hope you know kirin chip is taiwan product not china product are you drunk where did you get that information link please
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,many mate pro users updated harmony os version found that the kirin under more hope you know kirin chip is taiwan product not china product
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,uh google it you could had just google without even asking xd anyway looks like one of th more you remind me of this guy that was relentlessly trying to persuade me and group of people that he perceived the mercedes gtc model to look like porsche bruv thats your and most of the times no one cares of what you see or think if you perceive phone as remote control then
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,if you potentially buy chinese model nad use it in europe but buy this satelite subscription only and if you get coverage from these satelites you probably gonna use the function too the phone is not on sale here but you got it from china and buy subscription yes the coverage is only in china by those satelites but they cant exactly do areas it spreads
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,its amazing phone love it
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,wtf is bathroom remote uh google it you could had just google without even asking xd anyway looks like one of those brondell bidet toilet remotes the spec of this phone looks good but its ugly looking
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,this phone looks like bathroom remote that back camera is huge and kinda ugly xd wtf is bathroom remote
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,it can satellite calling and text yes with beidou its charged service
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,fun fact samsung has their own tizen os but it is the same type of os you called new more lol samsung and iphone is nothing in the front of hauwei they do not compet hauwei therefore they baned ggle
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,years of ban and somehow able to bypass it and some people still calling this bad product more fun fact samsung has their own tizen os but it is the same type of os you called new operating system as you call harmony os lol its all linux based the same as android thats not new have great day samsung fan
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,mean right now the benchmark is doesnt matter because its starting road for huawei in chip industry just sit back and watch how huawei will grow again cant wait
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,its not gonna be better this chip is nm and features custom cores that has lot of po more again similarities in all known scores are obvious kirin cpu gpu mem ux total score gen cpu gpu mem ux total score is gpu do your own math and include proximate bonus on hyper threading known about gpu maleoon famous cartesian gpu architecture will bring together the last piece of huaweis selfdeveloped puzzle of cloud ai thus becoming the integrated infrastructure base complete body of its internet of everything allscenario intelligence strategy combined with selfdeveloped the system builds closedloop experience about power in real use battery have after day of use and real time charging min hyperthreading in action is impressive multitasking httpsbitlywsubf and bust performance by ht like pc chip also st in the world kirin is soc with st in the world baron ready fullfrequency modem that means any any country it will work insane engineering by hisilicon all that performance in nm it is bravura
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,my opnion think this chipset is different and better than that old version of kirin more yes its little difficult to say as gpu is not clear anyway the snapdragon gen scores that you gave belongs to and kirin score belongs to but also like if its same as snapdragon gen maybe its same with snapdragon gen or maybe snapdragon gen
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,ehh decade of dominance but still cant put nvme ssd on their mobo
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yo wtf just askin just compare the clockspeed clock speed performance chip can have high clock speed and still run like garb
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,awesome nice comeback huawei
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,just come here to state that huawei was able to bring the air gestures grabshot and airscro more the three holes within the settings app you can change it to notch just like the apple notch
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,to be honest will always choose huawei among other phones have ultra and just wai more to be honest you would always choose huawei among other phones so you have ultra wait what so you always chose huawei was that before you bought galaxy or after you bought galaxy
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,screentobody ratio is due to that three holes on top
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,bro live in bangladesh some payment apps some transportation apps does not work more well thats why you have gblox soon or later more developers and apps will eb available on harmony play store and will be competitive or rival to google or apple then you wil not worry for something you dont have even for huawei it was unexpected move with harmony but once us started this useless cold war there is no turning back just waiting for the moment when harmony will be leader in cell phone os and will beats rest two like nothing us had too much impact on ordinary people and would love to have everything under controll time to turn pages on book and start anew
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,try face id could but sometimes do turn off the face id because of battery longevity since the front facing camera is always turned on to detect your face another thing is that am finger print fan myself but good point tho
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,think the processor details are wrong here in gsmarena
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the performance is literally not known as of right now so we also dont know what chipse more its definitely around so add that up and its similar to snapdragon performance
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no but if this phones performance it is is close to snapdragon and if compared more the performance is literally not known as of right now so we also dont know what chipset is it comparable with considerably huge generation gap between between the and the gen no its not unless you are heavy gamer in which case you arent looking at this as your next phone but are choosing between something from zte or maybe from asus rog
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,how do you know do you have this phone that you know all this information no but if this phones performance it is is close to snapdragon and if compared to snapdragon gen there definitely is noticeable difference you dont need to own two phones to compare thats considerably huge generation gap between
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,bet the iphone pro max comment section will be hotter kinda doubt it as that phone is out of my interest so wont be in the comment section of it lol
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,for real synthetic score is kinda like gimmick reallife performance is lot better the rog phone ultimate has much better synthetic score than the iphone pro max but how about the reallife scenario and reminder huawei created their own os which simply andor theoretically means that optimization should be lot faster and better compared to android who is used by multiple vendors
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,eh wouldnt call you samsung fanboy since you are actually nice person agree more atleast im samsung fanboy who fully aware that watt isnt even close to fast charging
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,it can run normal games smoothly but in extreme games it cannot handle as well as current chi more how do you know do you have this phone that you know all this information
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,what is the difference between pro and pro only on display why dint you read the specs and you will know
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no no darling yext if you mean that score think you rushed momentyou were saying more that was just quote from the person replied to
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone this is phone usi more her im not even girl at least get the basics right of any given comment you make is still nothing but gibberish last is calling me and specifically me out maybe you would know lot more about phones and possibly manners too if you werent just following me counting my comments all day every day
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,of course it supports gps ll glonass galileo eeaeb these three positionin more thanks nibol have nice one
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,cptpower sep my friend and who needs garbage google open huawei mean harmony app store search for gblo more bro live in bangladesh some payment apps some transportation apps does not work without google play store these numbers are many
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,does anybody know if huawei phones work well with gps location in canada when using google more of course it supports gps ll glonass galileo eeaeb these three positioning systems are enough
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,huawei need to improve on chip and software while sam should improve on build quality color more httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone this is phone using nm soc its not going to set the world alight well benchmarks anyway all you have to do is look at another mm phone to get rough ballpark figure the synthetic benchmarks that could be posted if comparisons be made it is an athlete returning after injury nm is not going to compete with apples nm of android nm the furore is that the usa thought it stopped huawei nm it didnt it didnt prevent huawei is that even part of the huawei opinion no even the usa could have forseen this plato our need will be the real creator which over time english proverb necessity is the mother of invention youre right the time of this post there was ot these was sms is diatribe by my negative iq troll and another all the negative votes are from thus person praise or laud her she reward you you reciprocate by voting it doesnt matter that she is wrong if you make comment that is counter to her inaccurate view it is down marked seriously telling person to get lost from the platform if you didnt know on what topic she was posting in you would think you were listening to pre schoolers talking so from the article leaked galaxy ultra specs include titanium frame upgraded cameras and snapdragon chip httpswwwgsmarenacomnewscommpphp sms seeking to tell informed people they are wrong and she us right how can you have comments on phone bit by bit no worship me please text remember you post will remain long after your intellect improves
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,this comment section is on fire but also want to know if huawei will ever bring back the ai more unless its been explicitly removed it should be present on every huawei mate flagship since the mate as well as the pro someones gotta confirm it though because cant
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,whatever keep believing that the gpu is unknown and waste your money on snapdrago more made mistake on the gpu score checked another source the exact score is not confirmed yet but its approximately quote from you even you admitted that the gpu score is unknown
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,wish honor would rebrand this so it can have gms
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,know what you said dont you worry about that not that you know the performance of more whatever keep believing that the gpu is unknown and waste your money on snapdragon phone
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,huaweis movin frm beautiful to officiallooking colors
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,please learn some comprehension said it cannot handle as well as other chips in th more know what you said dont you worry about that not that you know the performance of this phone so you have no idea what it can and can not handle you didnt even know nor did you want to accept the fact that the gpu score of the chipset is as of right now until enough people mentioned it again you know nothing about the topic and despite the clear love towards the mate series you are still trying to spread the hate towards it
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,and how would you know that it can btw please learn some comprehension said it cannot handle as well as other chips in the market not it cannot handle heavy games if you meant that it can handle games as well as other chips in the market and how would you know that
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,huawei please dont use hybrid dual sim use only didecated dual sim slot with didecated sd card slot
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,thats cool good thing the mate series can play any game very smoothly not happy wit more it can run normal games smoothly but in extreme games it cannot handle as well as current chipsets in the market
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,do you even have the phone nope and clearly you will never have it nobody else but you wil more you dont need to own the phone to tell the performance difference obviously it cant handle as well as the gen
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,nope can when put game to max performance there is surely quite big difference do you even have the phone nope and clearly you will never have it nobody else but you will be complaining about the performance yet you know nothing about it
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,ok is there problem with that people do play games to relax from such stuff like this thats cool good thing the mate series can play any game very smoothly not happy with that just get gaming phone with absolute garbage cameras and play your games
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,lmao mobile gaymers complaining about phones ok is there problem with that people do play games to relax from such stuff like this
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,qdoes huawei confirm kirin nm
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,put on blind test bet my ass you cant tell the performance difference nope can when put game to max performance there is surely quite big difference
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,no reason to buy this over pro if this phone does not heat up and has more stable performance than the pro then this phone is choice rather than the pro the pro has been plagued with issues such as heating issues optimization issues and screen freezing really think that snapdragon processors are not for huawei phones at all
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the mate series has been the center if attraction now and this is the first time after the ban that have seen huawei phone on the daily interest from what have read the kirin performance can match or outmatch the snapdragon and it also can match or outmatch snapdragon gen not the plus gen since some people are still stating that the plus gen and the gen are the same another thing is that apple and qualcomm can be the biggest losers most specially in the chinese market as china bans apple devices from their government offices and soon that china could ban apple completely second unisoc also releases new chipset that has performance almost on par with the dimensity but thermals are bit of downside since it is still new chip the unisoc chip and the new huawei kirin could potentially steal orders from qualcomm and now huawei is retaking the market that it has once owned prior to the most selfish and unfair ban the us has ever made just to save their apple remember that huawei has defeated apple on the number of phone shipments by million in and month after that the ban was announced and not only that the us is persuading and threatening other countries to join their personal resolve to save their own companies remember that the dutch asml said loud and clear that they will never join the us in this selfish act just month later they were force to join remember people competition is win for us consumers since competition is one of the reasons why companies try their best to innovate and that is also one of the reasons why they priced their products competitively competition is word that many us officials hated the most competition is always viewed as threat to western companies am very excited to see competitively priced apple product really wonder what another american propaganda will that youtuber serpentza will upload to his youtube channel
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,perfectly acceptable flagship territory lol thats funny thats lik more put on blind test bet my ass you cant tell the performance difference
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,stop bein so mean it aint huawei fault that theyre banned and at least theyre tr more exactly think the same some brands should also return
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,there are billion people on earth and by looking at just people you say nobody agree more stop bein so mean it aint huawei fault that theyre banned and at least theyre tryin fyo therere bn ppl nt bn
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,gsmarena made mistake about the spec info of mate pro it has dualsatellites system commuication tiantong satellitecalling and texting bds satellite only texting and pro and pro have face id rampro gb progb
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,never said it was bad only said its just midrange in at least they are still capable though wont be midrange if they are being stacked by software updates unless if apps or games demands more
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,everyone is fanboy to you that disagrees with you last time disagreed with you you more yeah whatever you dont have anything to defend huaweis chipset anyways
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,see nothing wrong with snapdragon in atleast its not snapdragon never said it was bad only said its just midrange in
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,your logic doesnt match mine well everyone has their own logic so
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the everyone you mean are just the huawei fanboys including you everyone is fanboy to you that disagrees with you last time disagreed with you you called me vivo fanboy and now ive magically turned into huawei fanboy thats outstanding
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,it sure is great conlcusion as nobody agrees with you in this comment section and that more the everyone you mean are just the huawei fanboys including you
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,literally the best phone available right now there is not single aspect that this phone lacks well some could say it have no jack for earphones some could say it supports only huawei nano cards and only up to gb no tb or tb either someone can say it does not make videos or photos also some could say charging is topped at only while others give or even also kirin build on nm platforms or proces compared to ucomming dimensity made on nm fabrication proces there are plenty but somehow agree with you it have many things which other phones lacks so somehow its best phone available to buy hope and really hope there wont be any google spy app inside nor android it self hope for pure harmony experience
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,it will be very good to compare kirin with gen nm they are the real match it was in more some new updates kirin hyper threading can improve overall performance by but power consumption is up by then low frequency power consumption ratio test shows its equivalent to tsmc nm process
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,spec does not saying no google play store that means it may have google play store my friend and who needs garbage google open huawei mean harmony app store search for gblox app press download and install it will give you latest android over hjuawei harmony if you need that but to me google have nothing important which would be must have for me anything is accesible via brownser or from harmony play store as equivalent mean simmilar app
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,maleoon gpu have no idea but kirin sounds just fine anyway great specs for great phone and good for those who still preffer outdated obsolette and useless sd cards where even usb is billion times faster and more user friendly
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,cool then buy an ultra and get lost from here nobody agrees with you and nobody ever wil more there are billion people on earth and by looking at just people you say nobody agrees with you great conclusion you can keep defending huawei as much as you want and avoid the facts
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,gpu score checked another source the exact score is not confirmed yet but it more perfectly acceptable flagship territory lol thats funny thats like very slightly better snapdrgaon which as of is just midrange performance
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,this looks like flat screen and it shouldnt be bad idea if huawei take the mate back from the edged screens which think is getting overrated
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,made mistake on the gpu score checked another source the exact score is not confirmed more gpu score checked another source the exact score is not confirmed yet but its approximately kk is and that is perfectly acceptable flagship territory not gen level but how could it be its nm and it isnt tsmc not that approximately means too much it could basically be anything from kk anyways the exact score is not confirmed yet is all we need to know about you and your reliable sources only linked one source youtube video where it was clearly shown that the gpu score is and thats exactly what saidclaimed and backed that up its not like scores matter anyways what matters is real life usage and great example of that are most exynos chipsets they tend to score really well since their cores are actually good but because of the lack of optimization they dont perform nearly as well as they should based on their scores huawei has always been great at optimizing their own chipsets so that wont be the issue here
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,by the same logic you could be called samsungexynos fanboy since you avidly defend them more defend please link the comments
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,genuinely curious where youre getting the gpu score from have done quite bit more made mistake on the gpu score checked another source the exact score is not confirmed yet but its approximately httpswwwgooglecomampsinquisitiveuniversecomhuaweikirinseverythingweknowrightnow
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,ok huawei fanboy keep believing whatever you want im not huawei fanboy im fan of truth and the truth is what believe thus not what you are saying havent even used huawei phone since even though would have the money for any of them oh what weird fanboy am
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,oh thats true mine can actually be backed up while you are just straight up wrong ok huawei fanboy keep believing whatever you want
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yeah keep deluding yourself keep thinking kirin ss full performance is unknown more the gpu score is unknown at the moment and was therefore excluded from the overall score also the overall score came from antutu not from antutu gives around kk more points on average than antutu for equivalent hardware
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,in any case there are not many differences between the honor device and the huaweis one httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,how stubborn are you literally nobody agrees with you and you still think you are right ins more yeah keep deluding yourself keep thinking kirin ss full performance is unknown btw it scored around for antutu total score and for gpu score which is just bad for todays standards
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,camera wise is mate to downgrade just asking not at all
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the punch holes are better than iphones dynamic island look symmetrical
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yeah totally unknown you must be living under rock or something how stubborn are you literally nobody agrees with you and you still think you are right insane httpsyoutubexlattvksibcccmslwnuehoi just watch this youtube video already or take it straight to the mark and tell me the gpu score of the phone
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,if you have the money there is nothing wrong right if have money would buy myself isu more yeah youre right
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,the chipsets full potential is still unknown as the gpu still cant be recognized more yeah totally unknown you must be living under rock or something
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,yaay more holes change it to one in settings
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,looks like one punch hole is not enough and there is three put some more then you can change it to one of you want
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,how long until the global os is going to be available
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post proof
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,deleted post samsung
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,google play services and chipset do lack do you have the full knowledge on this soc yet to already give verdict
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,so china only os build states china but nothing else
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,imagine having to pay for phone with performance that cannot even beat dimensity rofl if you have the money there is nothing wrong right if have money would buy myself isuzu mu and mate pro and samsung ultra we do not give sht to your money so do you so do not say stuff like imagine paying dollars on phone that has theoretical performance on par with the snapdragon it is their money bruh you cant command them be hater all you want others money is others money
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,can anyone here kindly tell me which zoom is better the optical zoom and the digital more dude we you are keep asking about optical zoom if you want this much just take ultra believe me dont get pro plus why cuz its hardware is too old not in the camera department but in the other specs hz screen outdated soc mah and slow charger at just so just get new flagship dude like xiaomi ultra or find pro or even pixel pro they all will give you better experience maybe not in zoom but equally good plus better camera experience
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,desire these specifications in google pixel phone
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,its clearly flat the entire mate series is then id be sure that this phone would be much durable their kunlun glass was known for durability
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,curved its clearly flat the entire mate series is
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,as know pro have one more canera on the back side and one more in the front therefore ha more yaay more holes
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,is it having flat screen or curved display curved
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,huawei mate pro supports tiantong satellite phone and twoway beidou satellite message becoming the worlds first mobile phone equipped with dualsatellite satellite communication
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,wish they had put the battery like of the mate with carbon extends life and increases sot
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,when are manufacturers gonna get rid of the max pro one plus naming scheme
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,which in your expert views should get mate pro or wait for the pro plus running harmony os are they better than oneplus and upcoming thanks
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,mate next year must buy it
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphoneidphone more their first pro in this range in which range the mate range the mate pro is also thing since
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,this phone got the us shook at this point the us government will try to completely destroy huawei thanks to the new processor
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,this is rumored to have the ability to connect to two tiangtong satellites at the same time
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,best flagship like an iphone without apples limitation
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,httpswwwgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphoneidphone noticed huawei has dropped qualcomm replacing it with kirin generally not specific to huawei predicted by analyst kuo dont know where the distinction lies to differentiate between pro and pro except the memory configurations not imo criteria their first pro in this range overall you cannot fault what huawei is offering so wait see if is clarified especially to see the benchmarks kirin posts
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,that looks very sporty somehow and beautiful
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,nope it was kirin good job
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,pro got mp ultrawide and gb ram and slightly higher pixel density screen yeah like said no big difference
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,theres barely any difference in specs from the mate pro pro got mp ultrawide and gb ram and slightly higher pixel density screen
Huawei,Mate 60 Pro+,what is this again
Huawei,Mate 60,its rocking this phone and its very slick added with google mobile services its actually doing very well
Huawei,Mate 60,dont get it why this phone so hyped and what so special about this phone compared with more because it is kind of chinese phone that didnt use any foreign technology
Huawei,Mate 60,its great that apple google were exposed in the lawsuits this gives definitive proof th more most we can do is just do compartmentalization select which data we can share with the device snowden did pointed it out that every device isnt safe if you want to talk privately then meet in real life and leave any internet connected device outside the room this privacy issue is just selling tactic or gimmick reason why say this because usa spied on its citizens more than the countries spying on us so why all of sudden we started caring about privacy when we didnt do much in the past years it sounds like your just caring about your stock gains than privacy
Huawei,Mate 60,considering the fact that there had been alot of privacy lawsuites some even proven agai more its great that apple google were exposed in the lawsuits this gives definitive proof that these companies are unethically pulling data from their own users it will be no surprise if huawei encounters this same problem in the future since like apple huawei is now relying on their own chipsets and closedsource software for their own smartphones which leads to easier data collecting and questionable privacy practices in the software part of harmonyos is open source which is good but the actual software installed on devices is closed source
Huawei,Mate 60,in software itll be disabled if you disable it or if you dont set it more considering the fact that there had been alot of privacy lawsuites some even proven against apple google while huawei have yet to be proven of such even before being bannedsanctioned by us they werent even able to prove of them spying besides mass propaganda im pretty sure folks who are spreading that huawei always on etc set it up to always on mostlikely for click views
Huawei,Mate 60,reading these comments makes me worried is it always on are you sure it cant be disabl more in software itll be disabled if you disable it or if you dont set it up problem is any smartphone with software designed especially by huawei or google or apple will continue to monitor you through the smartphones sensors whether you like it or not im just saying its something you should be aware about is it something you should be worried about depends on what you do
Huawei,Mate 60,just dont think there is need to be this scared but okay not scared for now yeah but more awareness is important
Huawei,Mate 60,not just the camera either but the microphones too again tons of data is collected by these more just dont think there is need to be this scared but okay
Huawei,Mate 60,none of this is good but the only solution would be to not use any phone so dont more not just the camera either but the microphones too again tons of data is collected by these smartphone companies on the device not only through the physical sensors there are alternatives to not use phone at all and it all depends who you are willing to give your data to and how much of it and many arent aware of this
Huawei,Mate 60,even apple faceid is alwayson so it can easily unlock fast their phone exactly more convenience less privacy quite simple
Huawei,Mate 60,its lot more than search history you brought up cameras and the fact that they are always more even apple faceid is alwayson so it can easily unlock fast their phone
Huawei,Mate 60,my comment had nothing to do with whatever youve just replied to it either way don and the fact that the government has access to tons of your personal data whenever they want ignorance is bliss
Huawei,Mate 60,you want to laugh it off but its all true no matter which company you buy from theres always more my comment had nothing to do with whatever youve just replied to it either way dont get all this fear from spyware like seriously why does it matter to you that random server has what youve just searched for as long as my money isnt stolen from my bank account due to security issue just simply dont care
Huawei,Mate 60,if you turn on face unlock on any phone the camera will always be on just turn it off if yo more you want to laugh it off but its all true no matter which company you buy from theres always spyware baked in to the software all those additional privacy settings are only surface level to make you believe that all of your data is only available to you only you just dont want to believe its true but whatever ignorance is bliss right
Huawei,Mate 60,saw thatits really freaky if you turn on face unlock on any phone the camera will always be on just turn it off if you dont want that
Huawei,Mate 60,there are videos out from weibo showing that the both cameras on this phonefront and back is more saw thatits really freaky
Huawei,Mate 60,your comments arent any more reliable either you guys shouldnt be debating this over speculation best to wait for actual feedback about the mate and the kirin performance
Huawei,Mate 60,not reliable at all as the gpu cant be scored and just gets as score as of right no more your comments arent any more reliable either
Huawei,Mate 60,is baron modem inside speed ready
Huawei,Mate 60,scores for kirin and gen respectively single core score multi cor more it will be very good to compare with gen nm they are the real match it was in the mate only year ago the st phone with mil points score the same score were awaiting for kirin nm remarkable and on top of that he have st in the world hyper threading in cpus like pc chip astonishing
Huawei,Mate 60,but bands are not listed in specs think it has because many news are reporting it really has think gsmarena wants solid video or evidence that it really has so that they could edit its specs
Huawei,Mate 60,cool thanks for sharing how reliable do you think these numbers are id love to more not reliable at all as the gpu cant be scored and just gets as score as of right now httpsyoutubexlattvksibcccmslwnuehoi
Huawei,Mate 60,it has and satellite calling but bands are not listed in specs
Huawei,Mate 60,this probably gonna be released for global without it has and satellite calling
Huawei,Mate 60,why no this probably gonna be released for global without
Huawei,Mate 60,dose it support playstore doubt it
Huawei,Mate 60,nice job huawei for kirins you prove it
Huawei,Mate 60,if western still not responding with doing extreme sanction while mate series releasing more huh wdym some us official visited china asking huawei to stop developing etc but they just gave her mate pro
Huawei,Mate 60,wanted to edit and post link to the mate chipset but it couldnt be posted immediate more yeah okay ill just wait until the phone is actually on sale and the information becomes clearer
Huawei,Mate 60,what am supposed to do with this this is the mate we do not know anything about the chi more wanted to edit and post link to the mate chipset but it couldnt be posted immediately httpswwwhuaweicentralcomnewkirinsgeekbenchtestshowsperformanceabovenmkiring
Huawei,Mate 60,sure here it is httpsbrowsergeekbenchcomandroiddeviceshuaweimate httpswwwh more what am supposed to do with this this is the mate we do not know anything about the chipset of the mate pro
Huawei,Mate 60,any source on what you just mentioned httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparequalcommsnapd more sure here it is httpsbrowsergeekbenchcomandroiddeviceshuaweimate httpswwwhuaweicentralcomnewkirinsgeekbenchtestshowsperformanceabovenmkiring httpsbeebomcomsnapdragongenbenchmarkstextbenchmarkscoresgeekbenchinthemultidthreadedtest fyi the gen scores dont tally to what say as what said was the minimum score of the chipset
Huawei,Mate 60,the chipsets performance is literally unknown as of yet quit jumping to quick conclusions scores for kirin and gen respectively single core score multi core score also has and as single and multi core scores respectively so clearly is only marginally different from its predecessor especially judging by the name itself
Huawei,Mate 60,funny how people dont mind paying eur for gaming performance theyd re more the chipsets performance is literally unknown as of yet quit jumping to quick conclusions
Huawei,Mate 60,specs sheet stop at lte so yes there is none the specsheet isnt complete yet
Huawei,Mate 60,if only huawei was not sanction people will have been opting for them probably more than samsu more that was the point of sanctions usa cannot compete so they ban huawei and in turn make their allies like south korea and taiwan benefit from it good thing china knows how to fight back unlike japan that sign plaza accord that favors the us
Huawei,Mate 60,no on this phone specs sheet stop at lte so yes there is none
Huawei,Mate 60,at least among flagship phones huawei still give space for sdcard
Huawei,Mate 60,shame this model wont get european release only pro well the pro variant wont be released globally too probably because they got working again would be better if they used the same snapdragon chips from their previous phones
Huawei,Mate 60,you can change the punch hole to one solid in settings if you dont like the holes think that would be lot worse but then again have no issues with the punch holes think that looks better than how apple has done it
Huawei,Mate 60,perfect for those who hate the punch hole on the pro variant you can change the punch hole to one solid in settings if you dont like the holes
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,were talking to you from huawei mate rs ultimate design for those whove been bothering us with comparisons shut up bit huawei top
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,the device is pretty decent
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,overall this really is nice hardware specifications as this phone is running harmony os china expect its software too be lot lighter better optermized then android find on the standard mainstream phone reason for this is google has lot of market share so and it takes advantage of this and can get away with faults its less popular or well known brands cant google actually really lags on purpose make you upgrade too new phone google only gets away with this behavior as google has monopoly in android with the google app store google services also run heavy in the background mainly at fault for this problem so most people just dont know any different as youre probably using google chrome the browser tabs hog all of the system ram as well have even proved this with independent testing basically every chinese market phones with there own app stores os ui interface without google runs quicker yes they run android using nubia with very good hardware as well think given the changer also comes in the box with chinese phones which also factors into the price theres lot too like but not at the price of lack of strong none chinese competition as well
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,phone with nm chip cost is joke its euro more than oneplus who will buy th more real talk bro
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,there still isnt much in the uk and think they turn it off at midnight where live my more as am working in telco that is part of power saving scheme overnight to save resources the majority of the network is configured in such way that it automatically shuts off idle resources
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,ppl who comparing like this stupidly download speeds are naive and has no clue even if more there still isnt much in the uk and think they turn it off at midnight where live my phone always reverts to overnight
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,eur for phone wtf why are you surprised all smartphone manufacturers charge such prices for their flagship phones nowadays
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,deleted post youre back anyway the actual results are already out antutu score of and its nowhere close to the ones you obtained the hyper threading is just over clocking which every chip can do
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,good phone but for the price its not worth it its soc from phone no one looks only the soc for their next smartphone
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,this this phone is just right for me the camera is megapixels and it also has very cool display give this phone an
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,think its the open source android too or old one cant remember which one more its based on android since its open source therefore it differs from completely different operating systems so in fact you are right am develooer for both ios and android in the past also developed apps for bb os windows and even jolla for very brief time
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,dont trust him he basically just posts this everywhere and has no evidence to prove so ppl who comparing like this stupidly download speeds are naive and has no clue even if would have fastest your operator will still be controlling you what speeds you will get so it absolutely doesnt matter had huawei mate and still had to meg speeds so compare it to todays phones same what he is arguing specifications on paper which never ever are achieved in real usage in any tech it is like talking about ssds how they have mbs and when transfering the actual real transfer is half or mostly even less
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,still rs is best
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,pavlecom thanks again for sharing its amazing nm cpu has far faster download more dont trust him he basically just posts this everywhere and has no evidence to prove so
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,you have obviously no source for that because it aint true lmao darlingyext surely more thank you someone else finally pointed this out pavelcom keeps posting these alleged leaked scores but has no solid evidence to prove otherwise now pavel is going to give your comment an lol
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,deleted post you have obviously no source for that because it aint true lmao darlingyext surely would this just because im speaking facts
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,heres good review of specifically huawei phone httpswwwyoutubecomliveiyyicabr more thanks for the laugh though cant seem to find the point
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,harmonyos is based on android lol until harmonyos next arrives where they kill off remaining codes of aosp
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,have already corrected you times because you have always come here to bother and post funn more why would you reply him that makes you both look childish more for you for replying the child
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,huaweiplease can you tell me if this device has portuguese from portugal vocabulary languagei am very interested to buy it because is the best smartphone in entire world my best regards
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,android itself has about of huawei contributed code developed while they cooperated toget more your forgetting to mention the decade relationship google has with samsung if samsung left google then it would be much different story the whole android is falling off is only true to you but in reality isnt
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,like that you type the links to comedy program tv here if you want us to laugh for while more httpsyoutubexhlfxfuicsitrqbhqtbnfasbnb
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,much better price this time cool fancy car branding will always make phones more so on the expensive side but its not unreasonable this time harmonyos china with gb ram tb storage is really good one big advantage with harmony os chinese software in general is good optimization with there specs should be really smooth harmonyos is probably really good android alternative as google is such laggy heavy app store that slow youre phone down on purpose by the way dont like the path google is heading down hopefully huawei makes comeback the appgallery hms core dont have the same problems as the google app store which purposely handle caps any alternative app store form functioning properly
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,andriod on the os wouldve been better harmonyos is based on android lol
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,ill say it againi see you are very in like what wrote so much that you wanna steal more that doesnt make any sense and you are still reading it wrong guess what any cpu and gpu can be unlocked to run faster than its intended spec its called overclocking could overclock snapdragon cpu and adreno gpu older than the latest kirin and make it perform better crazy right sorry but that difference is going to have to wait till the next generation lol
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,you read it wrong and its clear you are using translator that sentence that you said more ill say it againi see you are very in like what wrote so much that you wanna steal it and put to the other brand in some way sorry you must deserve that words like sertanly huawei is did about differences of tthe two soc its not very high as you like to bring up its only around for now said for now coz of kirin gpu are still locked and can make smaller gap after possible unlocking state bonus info smic does not made the kirin its the other fab respectively
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,see you are very in like what wrote so much that you wanna steal it and put to the other more you read it wrong and its clear you are using translator that sentence that you said and quoted applies to any brand lol and you love talking about huaweis gimmicky marketing and compare it to other specs when in practical environment it isnt any better compared to other phone brands
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,however its synergy of extraordinary design excellent materials and new techni more see you are very in like what wrote so much that you wanna steal it and put to the other brand artificially sorry that words you must deserve it like huawei sertanly is did
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,deleted post however its synergy of extraordinary design excellent materials and new technique of production and thats the real score by my opinion you are definitely working for huawei this comment could be copy pasted under the iphone and youd be an apple person lol if you wanna talk processors talk about apple silicone apple scores way higher than what kirin and snapdragon offer period
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,nice any reason you cant show gpu score apparently its not the preliminary result they deliberately not shown the gpu score therefore we can assume it will be more surprises lika cpu cores unlocking maybe there will be the same software unlocking of gpu maleoon so the final result can be much higher than same goes for the baron modern ready
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,deleted post correctly stated nm nanotubes running on steroids or nos if you ever get some time create some vids on your channel just thought
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,deleted post pavlecom thanks again for sharing its amazing nm cpu has far faster download upload speeds than nm feel its more to do with the design just feeling impo its probably as good or better than gen is it to do with the nanotubes you are one lucky person its week wait with deposit advance for preorder best regards
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,who cares about iphone series there is no innovation at all you do you bothered to talk about it
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,ultimate with snapdragon performance funny
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,is rs in name inspired by porsche gt rs
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,who cares about the iphone probably some apple die hard fans and some clout chasers probab more
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,might be nitpicking but tbh hate the big shape at the back but the camera lens looks small agree maybe huawei could have make the cameras bigger or just make that octagon shape little smaller
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,flagship phone uses nm chip no service another human being who always points out the size of the chipset rather than its performance also services may not be important as this kinds of phones are always sold only on china and as we all have known google has left china years ago and people on china does not use google or any of its services so there is no problem with having no google services
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,iphone pro max mp front camera didnt you know its about optimization more who cares about iphone series there is no innovation at all
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,do like the mate series including this model however without porsche design being behind this one dont think it worths the extra money over the mate pro plus
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,front cam just mp no af same as year old model smartphones iphone pro max mp front camera didnt you know its about optimization not the mega pixel
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,dont see there is any different between mate rs and mate
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,huawei is back in business and mate rs ultimate is the reason why samsung and apple should be worried imxv imx imx omvision
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,wow it is amazing good luck huawei
Huawei,Mate 60 RS Ultimate,huawei mate series phones are really unique
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,in china you arent allowed to criticize certain brands on social media platforms wheth more tesla in china started trend for suing people who made critical reviews on safty issues against their cars on social media such as douyingtiktock youtube demotes any videos giving objective views on china such as those xinjiang travel vlogs because they are labelled prochina they used to tune down the view numbers on the videos were popular say used to because havent been regular user of yt for the past years there are plenty of alternatives nowadays
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,unfortunately this device is not available globally
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,stupidity with ignorance whether you live in china or else the services within the phone more in china you arent allowed to criticize certain brands on social media platforms whether its for returns complaints suggestion for issues youll be seen as traitor and nonpatriotic id rather be spied by google meta and anything else as long they do not remove posts from criticism eg byd vehicle combusted on fire it caused devastation and the post is being removed and causes the so called legal lawsuit imagine that
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,hold up is that right side mounted fingerprint reader if so why sanctions they got it with fingerprint controller chips too besides who finds these stunning side mounted fingerprint may be tolerable on foldables and flips but in slab like this
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,theres nothing better about this device except for being overpriced and spied by ccp more meh big brother being an usa company aka the worst spying offender in the world should at least be able to spy you on os level as soon as you install its framework to enable appstore and use their service also if you are commoners living in us then being spied by cia is definitely worse than being spied by other countries
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,ccp is spying their own billions citizens with billions cameras on every corners except more httpswwwtheregistercomchineseandroidphonesleakpii innocent people vanish whenever the ccp decides to
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,how about google nsa and the whole usa spying on you such stupidity huawei devices esp more whos the stupidity with devices some other ch devices with you can flash rom without with huawei and apple no
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,mate pro doesnt support wifi only wifi
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,the huawei mate pros utilization of harmonyos rather than android presents signif more oh god too deep brainwashed by chinna
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,how about huawei spying you you cant even unlock the device anymore how about google nsa and the whole usa spying on you such stupidity huawei devices especialy mate and pura are premium simply much better than samsung apple or google devices
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,me too do we have any news how will the google services will go on mate pro there are more check youtube so many video to activate google services on mate pro
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,am still using my mate pro and thinking of upgrading is worth it to go for this phone me too do we have any news how will the google services will go on mate pro there are lot issues on mate pro
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,not sure why all the about sidemounted sensor side mounted is ergonomically more suit more agree except with the part that side mounted scanners are always more responsive theyre not ive had countless smartphones with side mounted fingerprint scanners and they werent nearly as accurate as most under display fingerprints sensors ive tried on smartphones and not only me but most people know that have phone with side mounted scanner also dont find them all that reliable
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,adipaul dec side mounted sensor limits you on the cases that you can buy not sure why all the about sidemounted sensor side mounted is ergonomically more suited and is always more responsive the industry standard is under display for flagships and upper midrangers sidemounted for budget and lower midrangers still find it odd that the mate has sidemounted one however this would never be criteria to pick or skip phone
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,yes thanks in the specifications its still in cm and just copied from there without more no cm is the correct unit cm
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,side mounted sensor limits you on the cases that you can buy
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,have you noticed that the chipset is not disclosed at all from other website the phone is us more its confirmed to be the kirin
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,yeah side mounted are pain to use its significant downgrade why tried every type of fingerprint scanner and sidemounted is the best for me
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,you mean mm not cm yes thanks in the specifications its still in cm and just copied from there without checking so pityfull
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,still if its secondary option why not keep it under display like in the past they are giving face id like option too thats why guess
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,think they use face id like iphone fingerprint is just secondary option still if its secondary option why not keep it under display like in the past
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,hope launch in global please huawei answer this question for us
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,what sensor size of this phone inch type or
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,almost inch
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,outstanding phone expected nothing less from huawei
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro,still rolling with my mate pro but maybe should upgrade to this
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,want this phone how can purchase go to wondamobile
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,huawei supports connectivity only for china
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,help me on how to deregister my mate pro from harmonynext beta program have rolled back to harmony in developer menu but harmony keeps coming back when the phone checks for update dont want to participate in the beta program anymore please help me because dont want harmonynext now but later when its available with the apps that use just want to use harmony only
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,has no one realized the biometric downgrade from under display to side mounted guess no one bought this outside china
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,what is really getting to me it does or it does not has support cant confirm this info anywhere
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,there is not such thing as the best for everyone exists other than for yourself more love this phone though its so insane
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,why no havent mm hands free jack
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,best phone ever there is not such thing as the best for everyone exists other than for yourself all phone has its strength and weakness
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,processor is still good it no best but you an still game and make really good photos yes
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,why huawei phone all almost expensive no apparent reasons other than the company being quite big in china from spec aspect find nothing special performance isnt best either build quality is just on par with most others in addition to that you pay more for less freedom cant change os good for hardcore huawei fans only it seems
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,trust me youre nobody the chinese gvt doesnt care about you seriously man im trying to refute some bullcrap from media though its real that these people from ch gov are very dangerous ive heard stories like they come to other country and kidnap influencers that speaks against that country some comes back while some doesnt almost same as nk
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,yesi tried it without sim card and felt insecure again anyway for nowi decided to turn more trust me youre nobody the chinese gvt doesnt care about you
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,you werent wrong about it its just how our mind sometimes works if we th more yesi tried it without sim card and felt insecure again anyway for nowi decided to turn off the device and switch to my old device feel much bettercalmnessfocus and talking about something that im not sure about it will scare me what is happening to me may have several reasons so wont judge about that device will try your idea thanks for your suggest custom romdegoogled phone are really great idea for now use my old device until getting chance to try your excellent idea
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,yesit was early to judge about it really dont want to give wrong informationbut maybe more you werent wrong about it its just how our mind sometimes works if we think it is the truth then it is perhaps something about the device makes you feel insecure if yes then suggest you to search on degoogled phone topic as to gain more freedom over what you do with the device instead of device locking you up in it just my thought
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,was huawei fanbut no matterbecause no one may care about what want to say now ha more by the way removing those apps dont affect much as theres still bunches of system level apps running and truckin ya however you are bit off about some of the stuff you wrote bet you read something too much and causing ya some sorta placebo effect ive been too many diff rabbit holes and know whats true and whats not somehow but not claiming know everything but its important to know how phone works as long as own one suggest you to pick phone which is boot unlockable with google free rom flashable then you wont have to worry about either side
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,very poor processor otherwise its good deal
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,updatei take out the sim card and think maybe it should be because of sim card not the devicesmartphone maker should not be stupid to do such risk to make his company bad yesi think the device should be safe however im not surebut think judge wrong about this device sorry everyone for such comment huawei should be good device
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,maybe you have different preferences but it doesnt mean everyone is the same do enjoy more
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,but he got point though if its just to play that game you dont need the flagsh more when pay the price of flagship phone expect every aspect to meet flagship standards whether im techsavvy or notand that includes gaming admire huawei especially for their design and camera performance as for my life choices you dont know me so lets not go there
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,just watched yt review of this phone running pubg at fps and it was crazy it consumed more who cares about such things why kids gotta cream themselves over being able to play year old garbage game on current gen phone just buy ps or an xbox for literally rd of the price gaming on phones is literally meme as if there isnt better things to do like umm dunno photography podcasts youtube music chatting with friends etc you know things phones are actually designed to do of people these days watch brainrot on tiktok but still fight and argue over antutu benchmarks when they dont even do anything with their phones omg it can play genshin gacha games at fps bro cmon
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,is the mate pro going to be globally available or will it be constrained to china from more its remaining chinaonly unfortunately that of course unless huawei changes their mind but doubt it
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,why huawei always keeping their camera sensor details as secret well ever since they got sanctioned they stopped disclosing the sensors they use in their cameras there are couple of reasons to sustain this like supply chain sensitivity since the sanctions disrupted their access to many suppliers including sony and samsung huawei might keep their sensors secret to avoid exposing vulnerabilities in their supply chain and potentially leading to more sanctions they could also keep it secret to maintain flexibility in their sourcing strategy this way they can switch suppliers without drawing too much attention or in the end it could also simply be because they might be using slightly weaker sensors than the competition and they dont want to be perceived as inferior but highly doubt that as camera performance is something huawei has always and still hits home runs in
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,huawei made the same mistake it made with mate line up and mate line up will not sell as more to be honest prefer the cameras rather than the camera on the honor magic pro or the magic pro feel that the camera module looks kind of weird tho
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,funny design similar to honor pro then buy the mate rs ultimate design you are talking nonsense if you dont like pro plus deisgn rs ultimate design is here you dont have brain
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,still running on nm chip heard it might take until something like for them to finally more funny things is that you wont notice difference in daily usage even for battery life huawei phone keep up against any flagship with or nm
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,average people dont care about os at all this is why ios is still the most popular smartphone os
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,pinephone is barely usable for average people much more convenient option is degoogled andro more average people dont care about os at all
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,know youre joking but if you are to run away from nsa you will never be using phon more surely harmonyosnext will be banned in the us and its dominions because of national security read no xxx agencies backdoors same as banning huawei from networks
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,not sure if those come preinstalled but if they are you can speak to the kid named deleting more it does every single manufacturer is collecting data about you and what are you doing ask yourself how in the world they are improving ai and other things you are test subject lol
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,that feeling when the nsa cant catch you lackin know youre joking but if you are to run away from nsa you will never be using phone as for huaweis case you will have to put trust in them company that has close connection with their gov there will be system level huawei services running and you wont be able to completely disable it no matter how much you try to debloat furthermore you may attempt to block connections with packet blocker though occasionally some connection will slip through
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,check pinephone pinephone is barely usable for average people much more convenient option is degoogled android will make it even more convenient with microg
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,how many nanometers is the lithography
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,congrats now you have temu aliexpress malware not sure if those come preinstalled but if they are you can speak to the kid named deleting applications
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,this the reason switched to huawei no google malware that feeling when the nsa cant catch you lackin
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,beautiful looking phone spec looks phenomenal too bad cant get it here and the price actually looks respectable too maybe ill try order from china and see if they willing to ship over
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,low chipset
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,looks like the mate not worth the extra in my opinion
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,mate pro with ufs
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,which processor is used in this device kirin based on antutu
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,windows phones am joke to you didnt huawei made windows phones ascend and haha its kind of like foreshadowing harmonyos
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,absolutely beautiful design
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,availability in panama will it have whatsapp and play store services like googles
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,no video with this price are you blind or are you coping
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,top resellers from amazon are businesses from china items sold by your neighborhood dropshipp more the joke went over your head too thats even more worrying sweetie if you dont want to be tracked dont buy smartphones
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,why are phone manufacturers so shy of breaking the inch screen size if they dont want it more there also exists mate which is inch
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,windows mobile predates all of themeven had features that android and apple were missing more totally agreed
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,yes windows mobile predates all of themeven had features that android and apple were missing microsoft had solid little os back in the late and blew it
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,super clone of honor magic pro you do realise that honor was owned by huwei right
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,beast of phone the st without apple ios or google android check pinephone
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,bruh its kerin you think this is gaming phone
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,oh miracle this one is working without any kind of processor this is the wonderful development more bruh its kerin
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,any details on chipset guys more than enough for your snapchat and instragram stories
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,googleless beast do you live in china because if you live outside of there you are talking pure nonsense
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,between pro and this see only mah difference is that all
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,looks great but think huawei should bring back the second telephoto camera as they did with mate pro pro
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,it has zoom not
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,googleless beast this the reason switched to huawei no google malware
Huawei,Mate 70 Pro+,googleless beast
Huawei,Mate 70,most people dont know what microg is it sorta imitates services and tells apps that more in addition to that you will have little more difficult time getting bank app registered some bank will tell you to disable microg during registration some bank staff has no idea why their app doesnt work on the device microg to myself is good stuff perhaps not with many average users
Huawei,Mate 70,yea you can using micro open source most people dont know what microg is it sorta imitates services and tells apps that you have services therefore it helps you to get many apps working on your device but not all apps and pay wont work
Huawei,Mate 70,absolutely not yea you can using micro open source
Huawei,Mate 70,kririn nm can compare with snapdragon gen nm hisilicons chip design techno more true when they were still able to have tsmc manufacture their socs their kirin designs beat crapple quackcom crappynos in both efficiency performance thats why they got banned because they were beating their competition
Huawei,Mate 70,hope gsmarenas planning to get their hands on one of the mate series model for revi more snapdragon elite phones have around the performance of kirin phones when tested in antutu if the scores on kimovil are anything to go off of points for the versus around million for the elite the seems to be comparable to the gen
Huawei,Mate 70,cpu spec function the os is compatible with other apps or does it hasspy wire its equipped with kirin
Huawei,Mate 70,what mp color spectrum sensors
Huawei,Mate 70,all mate use mpx camera what
Huawei,Mate 70,they fully ditched android moved to harmony os yes harmonyos was based on android in the previous years now huawei made it entirely independent from android it doesnt contain any android code anymore this is why they call it harmonyos next
Huawei,Mate 70,does it mean all the world will taste the harmony os
Huawei,Mate 70,awesome phone to be honest
Huawei,Mate 70,looks good at first lets see how the improved chip performs
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,recording in is for playback on display such as computer or monitor or tv duh that is different we are not talking about tv screens but phone screens can guarantee you of people dont record video on phone then hook it up to tv just to look at it
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,samsung galaxy literaly destroys this in benchmark yet after few years the samsung is tired they dont last
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,do you record in then because if you dont have screen whats the point more recording in is for playback on display such as computer or monitor or tv duh
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,no one can beat huawei in technology and innovation samsung galaxy literaly destroys this in benchmark
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,is pos on barely phone screen even sony dropped their screen for flagsh more do you record in then because if you dont have screen whats the point in recording in
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,its inches and its is it foldable or is it stone
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,youve got to be hardcore huawei fan for purchasing device for such high price like yeah they still make best phones ever so why not samsung and apple will be years behind them
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,huawei not supported google play guys no need always other solutions
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,where did mention the mp cameras in the first place clearly mentioned the mp iphone more clearly mentioned the mp iphones as an example because people didnt seem to care lmao yeah you mentioned nobody complaining about their mp sensors why mp is gimmick nobodys denying that thats when you use the but smartphone lenses cant even make use of that kind of resolution argument but even then sensor size is what makes more of difference however is only megapixels theres noticeable jump from megapixels to that on displays that support it doubt offering gb of ram is actually flaw when did anyone mention gigs this has what does stabbing someone have to do with this lmao its an analogy buffoon durrr hurrr samsung and apple offer less than other companies at much higher prices so its completely okay for this insanely expensive smartphone to have fewer features as well durrr hurrr sure stabbed that guy but because some other guy also stabbed someone its all good last time checked if something is this expensive you should at least leave out few non important things to lower the price tag like excluding recording crazy right last time checked if something is the most expensive thing on the market it shouldnt be leaving out things yknow its almost as if including all those things is supposed to be why its the most expensive like are you forgetting phones like the redmi pro exist are you forgetting that huawei is stuck with their inhouse slow socs im not blaming them for that but if theyre gonna offer specs similar to pro at over the price with almost weaker soc im gonna start blaming them oh right the pro phone that supports
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,except people did complain about iphones only offering mp sensors for years remember year more where did mention the mp cameras in the first place clearly mentioned the mp iphones as an example because people didnt seem to care lmao doubt offering gb of ram is actually flaw the phone doesnt really need more unless youre doing pc emulation and guess what flagship smartphones are still not there yet what does stabbing someone have to do with this lmao stabbing someone is illegal and has consequences none of the examples mentioned did even the recording because seemingly only select few people who are just there to randomly go on the website and find an excuse or the least important flaw of the phone seem to actually care if the phone can record at or not and lets be honest we know very well those people wouldnt buy those phones anyway theres no reason to exclude it at this price point yeah right last time checked if something is this expensive you should at least leave out few non important things to lower the price tag like excluding recording crazy right
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,literally hate to break it to you and apologise to do so but is useless at least right more except people did complain about iphones only offering mp sensors for years remember years back when companies just started offering mp sensors there was some blind photo comparison done with the oneplus pro versus some iphone and people picked the oneplus photos and it being the most expensive phone on the market is dumb reason you literally just listed two companies releasing flawed expensive products as reason to why this company should be able to do the same durrr hurrr sure stabbed that guy but because some other guy also stabbed someone its all good im also not gonna say mp sensors matter when it comes to sensors having larger sensor matters before having hundreds of megapixels thats why im not complaining about the sensors on this however these sensors should be capable of and you gain literally nothing from them failing to support for it doesnt matter whether or not you specifically think specific individuals are going to use it theres no reason to exclude it at this price point
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,no no you dont get it is completely useless you dont need that on your more literally hate to break it to you and apologise to do so but is useless at least right now bringing up filmmakers is stupid because they know better to just use entire kits and actual cameras fit for the job rather than smartphone and even if this particular smartphone supports if the camera in it entirety isnt fit for that job then that doesnt mean the phone will simply be better in years when gets better because the phone will stay the exact same and the phone having because its the most expensive phone on the market is stupid reason samsung makes one of the most expensive flagships and yet they offer less memory than their competitors apple offers cameras know megapixels arent everything which is exactly the point are mp on their phones instead of quiet literally offering mp main camera like xiaomi did with the redmi note pro plus and guess what the iphone is far more expensive and yet nobody seems to complain because guess what nobody actually needs those features other than select few people who can just go buy another phone if they think thats the right thing to do and by the way shill is person who helps person or organization without disclosing that they have close relationship with said person or organization or have been paid to do so
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,after reading the convo ive come to the conclusion that youre the shill here for more no no you dont get it is completely useless you dont need that on your most expensive nonfoldable smartphone on the market but im the shill right do you even get what the word means
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,im not repeating the entire argument had with the other corporate shill go read it more after reading the convo ive come to the conclusion that youre the shill here for arguing about how is so important which by the way it isnt literally useless gimmick and not mentioning other features that used to exist and are now gone lmao
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,randomusername dec iphones cannot record at buddy lol nobody mentioned iphones buddy lol
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,the lack of google is either reason to buy or not to buy this phone as am the side which only grudgingly using google yeah chinese replacement anytime
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,anyone with an iq above would clearly see my points here anyone with an iq more who really shoots at though looking at footage on phone is basically useless monitors cost upwards of more than american dollars samsungs own tvs cost more than dollars without including discounts and well just takes up so much space
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,ok so lets first talk at the present people who upload stuff to youtube othe more anyone with an iq above would clearly see my points here anyone with an iq above would understand that the most expensive phone on the market shouldnt leave out features as simple as recording and that even if you specifically dont like shooting in nobody gains anything from it being left out
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,as long as they do not have google service right out of the box and no for the price huawe more thats the reason buy huawei phones for not having google stuff in them
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,finally after days of waiting the processor came out for the specs does it have balanced cpu like tensor
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,they probably want face unlock to be the main unlock type just like on iphones also the si more to reiterate the face lock on mate pro is already so good that have never used my fingerprint you just pick up the phone
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,missing video recoding is pos on barely phone screen even sony dropped their screen for flagship because its pointless waste of resources
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,how is going to be used in the future because is insanely overkill for smartphone an more how is going to be used in the future because is insanely overkill for smartphone and it will hardly ever become convenient its not inconvenient to anyone who actually uses their videos instead of letting them sit in their storage doing nothing people who upload stuff to youtube other services or their nas dont need to worry about storage and everything from the early was either in or we still view such videos today but find its quality poor may not be viewed as poor quality at any point in the future but there will come point where its preferable to watch content in higher quality it may be years from now but these videos stick around stop being stuck in the present this phone is and its inexcusable for it to not have top of the line specifications you need high resolution sensor to film and cramming so many pixels into such small smartphone sensor reduces the size of each pixel which leads to poorer light sensitivity and image quality in low light scenarios obviously in the middle of the day outside thats not an issue if phone can shoot in you can shoot at during the day and during the night if phone cant shoot in youre stuck with lower quality in situations where its beneficial phones fraction this price can shoot in not only that but the lenses on smartphone cameras are also pretty small and can hardly resolve the fine details required for quality the quality difference between and smartphone footage on phones that actually properly support it is undeniable by your logic phones shouldnt even have because the difference when jumping from to on phone is smaller difference than jumping from to on dslr for the same reason stabilization in also requires more sensor crop and that logically reduces the field of view and resolution different manufacturers have different methods for handling stabilization some disable stabilization at higher resolutions altogether cameras dont always move when filming though and again stationary shots are crippled by phone not being able to shoot in when non phones can shoot in or if youre that against and then even if all of these were to be solved theres very few devices let alone smartphones that support native playback reads that has the potential to be used in the future bbut right now there isnt that many devices that benefit from it know professional filmmakers which say know countless works by professional filmmakers that use the complete wrong color balance countless works by professionals that have various flaws because the person behind the camera thinks their opinion on how the shot should look is right those professional filmmakers you see have never had their works displayed on foot display if they think is overkill the wedding videographer or fiverr videographer you know isnt professional filmmaker cant believe you have camera as pfp when youre literally arguing that its okay for manufacturers to cripple the cameras in the most expensive nonfoldable on the market but by all means drop your money on the phone go right ahead nobodys stopping you me personally ill keep calling out manufacturers for pulling these scummy decisions instead of defending them
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,ive listed the problems you think nobody uses you fail to see how its goi more how is going to be used in the future because is insanely overkill for smartphone and it will hardly ever become convenient the small smartphone sensors are simply not fit to film videos you need high resolution sensor to film and cramming so many pixels into such small smartphone sensor reduces the size of each pixel which leads to poorer light sensitivity and image quality not only that but the lenses on smartphone cameras are also pretty small and can hardly resolve the fine details required for quality then theres the file size with videos producing several gbs per minute stabilization in also requires more sensor crop and that logically reduces the field of view and resolution and then even if all of these were to be solved theres very few devices let alone smartphones that support native playback so is purely marketing feature on smartphones know professional filmmakers which say videos are overkill and they have professional cinema cameras worth tens of thousands of dollars then if even most pro filmmakers dont use why would random person need on their smartphone theres no reason
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,nobody uses nm ghz main core is powerful enough for many games other brands have no more ive listed the problems you think nobody uses you fail to see how its going to be used in the future you think nm chip with clock speeds only up to ghz is enough failing to take into account anybody elses use case scenarios you think because other companies are removing stuff that makes it okay you think gapps are replaceable when windows phones and the billion investment lost on them showed us they arent this is an phone this isnt just because you like to throw away money with no care in the world doesnt make these flaws acceptable at this price point
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,good for you but as whole think under display sensors are more reliable ive just more if it depends on whether its flagship or not think ive got more objective comparison considering theyre two phones from the same line
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,no footage slow kirin soc most likely massive hole in the display no gapps no mm more agree with the rest but recording is pos tvs are still expensive asf aint gonna be mainstream in the forseeable future unless you dedicate an entire living room for or tvs to actually notice it
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,nah had sidemounted fingerprint sensor on the power button on my redmi had zero more good for you but as whole think under display sensors are more reliable ive just had way too many issues with phones with sidemounted fingerprint scanners guess it also depends on the model of the phone whether it is low budget offering mid ranger or flagship
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,nah have to disagree with that across all the phones ive had probably of them more nah had sidemounted fingerprint sensor on the power button on my redmi had zero issues with that it was super fast now on my redmi the underdisplay sensor is insanely unreliable it may be because of the screen protector but thats problem that shouldnt exist half the time end up using my pattern to unlock my phone instead of the sensor ive tried reentering my fingerprint multiple times but no its just that bad
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,since was using huawei brand feel very good but now saw the huawei side mountain fi more me too
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,bigger wider and heavier than foldableswhat were they thinking
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,these rs phones always look so strange yet interesting if only had spare euros for yet another phone that id have to get from china lmao
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,so they copy from honor magic porshe design its the same design yo but wana know why no more its not copy it shares the design characteristics with the mate rs which came out before the magic series
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,they do not collaborate with porsche design anymore so this replaces it so they copy from honor magic porshe design its the same design yo but wana know why no have cpu information maybe new chip huawei owner
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,amazing the best phone
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,it look great both specs and the design at least the design is something new
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,the porshe design one they do not collaborate with porsche design anymore so this replaces it
Huawei,Mate 70 RS,wow the best mobile phone to date
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,have not found any smart phone that is better than huaweii it is the leader no wonder the rest ganged up to try to stop the unstoppable
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,the dang price is over kill
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,better than fold lol yeah right
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,saw the display spec and hoped it was large standard screen not foldable oh well
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,not only its cheaper but bigger screen
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,hope its cheaper than fold
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,very very nice and very good specifications
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,my zfold is better better for you maybe not everyone is samsung fan
Huawei,Mate X2 4G,dont understand is this gonna change the price or what
Huawei,Mate X2,based on my experience with mate xs the screen was really solid it had layers of expensive polymer film that were protecting and holding it tight in my opinion this is better than glass yes scratches is always an issue with any plastic screen but never had an issue personally with the mate xs and honestly speaking it looks much way better and sexier than mate im not sure if they used same protection films on mate probably not to save the cost
Huawei,Mate X2,the huawei fold is actually much better than this fold commend huawei on their innova more the mate xxs was way better than anything samsung had made till then but the technology was not there yet the screen folded outwards and was made from plastic which meant it scratched easily and was not that durable but as soon as foldable glass comes outsamsungs folding glass is just pinch better than plastic and not all that great huawei might make another outward folding phone
Huawei,Mate X2,if two products share the same form factors then the design will be naturally very similar bet more apart from the extra ram cant see what are the pros of fold from hawardware point view possibly and hopefully fold solves those but until then mate is no brainer as long as you can find it that is because practically it is ghost of device
Huawei,Mate X2,lmfao only gb ram epic fail my sultra has gb ram
Huawei,Mate X2,seriously how is the design poor like the outer screen is just more usable than the fold more the best the mi mix alpha the best officially released one the mate xs
Huawei,Mate X2,the biggest samsung fold ripoff yet ripoff so every phone looks like ripoff now is gen ahead of fold
Huawei,Mate X2,just needs stylus best use of that unfolded screen why else is it useful for videos you more everything is better on big screens anyone who made use of tablets cant go back to their phone for real phones are more portable however their screens are dingy and mostly unusable foldables marry the need for tablet sized screens portability once they mature traditional phones we used to call them phablets and smartphones before will die and foldables will replace them and we will still calling them phones bit of how we started calling smartphones phones and later phablets we started calling phones eventually we will call foldables phones
Huawei,Mate X2,you are wrong and you are easy to trust anyone mate has the same display like mate xs more mate has the same display like mate xs this statement of yours is just like saying pagani huayra has the same exact engine as pagani zonda when the reality its not at all huayra has the twinturbocharged zonda has the naturally aspirated
Huawei,Mate X2,the hinge may be better but that doesnt excuse the poor design seriously how is the design poor like the outer screen is just more usable than the fold then whats the best looking foldable in your opinion
Huawei,Mate X2,in my opinion like this better than the samsung and xiaomi the drawback is not just the price actual cost to import to the states but no official support from google and the risk on how long huawei will provide support to it
Huawei,Mate X2,lol it is lot better outer screen is usable and the hinge is sturdier the hinge may be better but that doesnt excuse the poor design
Huawei,Mate X2,lol way worse no one likes to have half the screen folded outside when there is literally ze more nope quite few people prefer their screens not to break when they accidentally let speck of dirt onto it before closing their phone
Huawei,Mate X2,for once actually like huaweis decision not to put camera inside the screen when its unfolded it becomes like true tablet and that is win for me but the mate xs astronomical price tag really puts me off with this foldable screen smartphone literally can buy brand new samsung galaxy fold and brand new sony xperia ii all for the same price for one mate
Huawei,Mate X2,way worse design than the and xs lol way worse no one likes to have half the screen folded outside when there is literally zero protection for it during accidents
Huawei,Mate X2,why is the mi mix fold not listed as competition for the its still not yet available for sale at the moment we have to wait for it
Huawei,Mate X2,you are so fun my friend do you know how looks display its just display without any more prove it instead of repeating the same argument over and over again
Huawei,Mate X2,awesome phone actually prefer the outward folding of the xs
Huawei,Mate X2,so its not same yeah thats what said btw learn the meaning of the word more you are so fun my friend do you know how looks display its just display without any additional parts
Huawei,Mate X2,lol ultra already has much better mp sensor and beats the cap out of huawai mp supe more how on earth is sus mp mode supposed to compete with mate xs ai mp mode when it cant even resolve as much details as the regular ss mp mode due to nonacell pixel arrangement you clearly havent looked at samples from any of those phones have you not to mention the mp image is extremely noisy because of the tiny pixel size and artifacts introduced from remosaicing process neither of which is an issue for an ai mp image huaweis noise reduction algorithms are more effective too so as result mate will hold up better under less than ideal lighting conditions as well
Huawei,Mate X2,actually huawei is still one of the executive members of sd association so obviously they ar more depends how up to date that list is but if they are they are still safer to have their own format to work with
Huawei,Mate X2,you need permission from the sd association to use their cards dont you suspect huaw more thats not the reason huaweis low midend phones still use sd card slots instead of nm slots nm slots are only present in their flagships sd slot is better than nm slot due to availability pricing but nm slot is better than no slot at all other companies are slowly getting rid of the sd slot on their flagships so prefer huawei sticking to their nm slot instead of getting rid of it altogether
Huawei,Mate X2,dont understand why people keep hysterically criticizing huawei of using proprietary more the nano memory card format isnt proprietary huawei gave the ip away for free everybody just chooses to give us no expansion instead
Huawei,Mate X2,but lexar also makes them huawei was even willing to give that second simnm sensor to everyo more yeah im using lexar card in my pro half the price of the huawei branded one suspect lexar who are now owned by the chinese brand longsys make them all anyway
Huawei,Mate X2,con huawei insists on using nano memory format at this point thats bett more you need permission from the sd association to use their cards dont you suspect huawei are delighted they created their own format because theyre probably banned from using sd cards anyway
Huawei,Mate X2,its extremely weird to see that this foldable tablet is reigning supreme over every sing more lol ultra already has much better mp sensor and beats the cap out of huawai mp super duper gimmick ai mode samsung doesnt have to take note of anything most reviewers agree ultra is already the best smartphone camera til this date gsmarena doesnt have the mp photo in the comparison but im sure if there was it would be more detailed than huawai mp xd
Huawei,Mate X2,how can anyone claim display is better than display lol anyone the poco more dont think so the iphone xr screen is far superior the poco suffered from the famous ghost touch issues like the mi aa and the screen brightness is also lower but would prefer oled at least
Huawei,Mate X2,probably the best cameras in foldable space mp ai is finally like mp otherworldly good
Huawei,Mate X2,just because they have the same size resolution doesnt mean theyre the same more you can try to find more information instead of to read just gsmarena the display is the same made by boe they just used different calibration and added better electronic part different cable to get hz
Huawei,Mate X2,you fall for marketing too easily putting fancy words in product doesnt make it bette more you are wrong and you are easy to trust anyone mate has the same display like mate xs if you see both devices side by side you will see what mean ps no issue with rastr on both of them
Huawei,Mate X2,no you are completly mistaken ppi is really important samsung has much more better more you fall for marketing too easily putting fancy words in product doesnt make it better if you read the review of this phone youll find that the display on the mate is really good and it has higher resolution hence higher ppi which greatly improves on text sharpness browsing content on the web would be far better on mate compared to fold
Huawei,Mate X2,display is definitely not better on huawei lol why are you judging display solely on ppi wt more anything below ppi is unacceptable imo you can disagree with me but you cant say ppi doesnt matter the lower the ppi the more jaggies youll see text wont be as sharp and so on
Huawei,Mate X2,youre completely mistaken mate is far better than fold better display decent more no you are completly mistaken ppi is really important samsung has much more better display better colours hdr support much more better brightness adaptive hz etc power of chipsetsok in syntetics benchmarks could find better results for kirin but soc has better optimalization and more consistent power
Huawei,Mate X2,thanks for the review now just waiting for galaxy fold
Huawei,Mate X2,by far the best booklet style foldable phone made to date the only one thats actually more gms is android my friend maybe you dont need it but generally the mass needs it and installing software via backdoor methods is not for everyone
Huawei,Mate X2,great review thanks
Huawei,Mate X2,compare with fold mate has no sence worse display battery life no google service mor more the joke is your comment all reviews show the mate is better in almost everything btw would never never buy again samsung device very shitty service now use since years huawei and am very happy with my phone waiting for the new os to get finally away from google
Huawei,Mate X2,would like to see huawri fan to praise inward folding design instead of outward from now huawei fan is same like apple now what apple doing must be the best
Huawei,Mate X2,still proprietary memory really they must be crazy
Huawei,Mate X2,not really when you consider that they are propietary format and expensive one too nm more when you consider things you should consider fairly you should also consider the fact that sd card used by other manufacturers is proprietary format too its double standard and stupidity that people accuse huawei of being greedy for using proprietary format while they have no problem with proprietary sd cards and they even want slot for proprietary sd card other smartphone manufacturers ditch proprietary sd memory card slot to save space in contrast huawei continues to provide expandability with nm memory card slot thanks to the fact that nm card format is smaller and most importantly the same size as nano sim card therefore an nm memory card can be inserted on the opposite side of the nano sim card tray without having to increase the dimension of the sim tray for an additional slot
Huawei,Mate X2,this does look more functional and better than the fold the outer screen is usable as its large enough really hope huawei can do more about its software but this does have widevine cert at least and unlike what gsma said the mate may actually have hdr have seen review of the playing amazon prime in fullhd resolution
Huawei,Mate X2,would say its easily one of the best foldable you can buy if you dont mind the absence of gms and an outrageous price tag no wireless charging shorter battery life and inferiour display quality compared to fold are definite cons but personally much more elegant design lack of crease consistent refresh rate across the outer and the inner displays and faster recharge time easily make up for it the cameras are obviously better in huaweis usual fashion and so is performance due to newer chipset though there seems to be some compatibility issues with benchmarks used overall fold is better in areas where high end galaxy phones usually excel but mate is surprisingly competitive despite being huaweis first attempt for infold foldable tablet great job
Huawei,Mate X2,huawei comes with free charger iphone not will buy huawei
Huawei,Mate X2,the first good foldable everything else has notable issues this one is usable when closed high end photography for once and when opened doesnt look like two halves imo the first mature fordable product still has issues bit too thick when closed when compared to true phone awkward aspect ratio when opened but trust will be solved moving forwards if every other over foldable was vx this one is truly foldable cant wait for the foldables that actually both become smashing phone and smashing tablet
Huawei,Mate X2,if only huawei brings back the quad camera setup for the mate im still impressed with this hardware lot despite being almost three year old ps up to this point only huawei and vivo gave quad camera on foldable phones even vivo went back to triple camera for fold which is real shame
Huawei,Mate X2,im still waiting for new horizontal foldable phone with quad camera only huawei and vivo did such thing to this point but even huawei scrapped it for the mate and mate which is real shame since this particular foldable phone has effectively the same main and telephoto cameras as the one in the mate pro
Huawei,Mate X2,all those fine now tell us about the life
Huawei,Mate X2,using from june till today is working smoothly at all you can say it is laptop as well and am using multiple apps including autocad with heavy files but never feel any issue before used htc samsung iphone xiaomi oneplus but huawei is the best and the harmony os is very smooth even feel better than ios and android as have many many usable features which are not available in ios or android my next phone will be huawei for sure
Huawei,Mate X2,remember pirate of bristol wearing in shenzhen huh
Huawei,Mate X2,someone else said that literally month and half ago remember pirate of bristol wearing in shenzhen
Huawei,Mate X2,maybe one side is thicker than the other and the specs mention the thicker one so when it more someone else said that literally month and half ago
Huawei,Mate X2,good deal with infrared
Huawei,Mate X2,havent tried it or seen it in person only impression from videos but im left with the impression that huaweis fold is on build and design the most impressive foldable on the market and mi mix obvious are not in the same leage and also left with the impression that samsung fold also comes second to the on design and build hopefully we will see other vendors go down this road as would definately go for foldable if was in the market for high end flagship unit
Huawei,Mate X2,download aurora store
Huawei,Mate X2,am talking about my personal experience about the mate as have purchased one and used more but because of the lacking of google services and its price will be hard to sell in other countries outside china
Huawei,Mate X2,dollars for inch tabletphone with amoled screen
Huawei,Mate X2,those who pay dollars for this phone is not going to be using earbuds huawei did not mak more as well its only available in china
Huawei,Mate X2,what was their excuse for not putting mm on this huge phone useless those who pay dollars for this phone is not going to be using earbuds huawei did not make this phone for the masses they made it for the elite group and to brag their technology prowess on they did not make the phone for you since they ditched the headphone jack for good years ago with the mate pro if you still want these triviances buy the standard that one is the best gmsenabled huawei with jack as well also realize that huawei has the last laugh here they were scorned at for switching their sd cards for their own proprietary cards but now look almost no flagship has expandable memory but huawei technically still hasbut suppose just buy sony then
Huawei,Mate X2,huawei got the outer screen display right since it has aspect ratio which makes it exactly the same as sony xperia phones but the inner screens rather unusual aspect ratio makes it difficult for app scaling and rather odd to use if we have foldable screen smartphone that has outer screen and an ipadesque inner screen that would definitely be the best of both worlds
Huawei,Mate X2,why there no camera in inside screen so how can it make video call
Huawei,Mate X2,you ok bro huawei doesnt even have million kirin and over million were more mac started at nothing while microsoft rules the world no look at the gap then look at android then look at hauwei if dont get it now soon you will
Huawei,Mate X2,euro thats usd bit much for phone especially with only gb of ram dont see any benefit of having more than gb ram on an android phone even midrange smartphone with gb ram already feels too fast
Huawei,Mate X2,love huawei huawei is the best
Huawei,Mate X2,what beautiful phone with scary price
Huawei,Mate X2,succesfully installed playstore in my xs looking forward to upgrading to when this gets released internationally
Huawei,Mate X2,the huawei mate is very grate phone and belive that huawei will be the world best phone
Huawei,Mate X2,the news just in due to the extraordinary high demand for mate huawei will double the sup more you ok bro huawei doesnt even have million kirin and over million were dedicated to the mate series there will probably be million devices available so would probably guess about mate xs will ever be made the majority of people will want the pseries not the mate huawei themselves knows that hence the remaining kirin chips will be used for the devices the xs legacy will go on but in terms of physical handsets very few will ever be sold
Huawei,Mate X2,but dont understand what you mean by this kicking fold out of the ballpark mean more agree what does he mean kicking out of the park it looks almost the same to me love samsung and huawei btw love the first huawei foldable but its too pricy this one im little less optimistic
Huawei,Mate X2,gb ram and no google services in this price no thank you its probably china only
Huawei,Mate X2,well the camera of huawei is and was way better than samsungs which is literally joke in more are you sure you are updated with the latest phones or you are still referring years ago most of the flagships camera are already neck and neck today even before pixel is the best on camera but it is not the same at this time google cannot make their new phone expensive because their camera was the best few years ago the only thing remember huawei camera was known before is with the night mode and telephoto dont remember they have better camera in general compare to others cannot see the joke there unless you are comparing the flagship camera of huawei to the budget camera of samsung anyway better is different for each person
Huawei,Mate X2,well we hated apple also for copying something and pretending they are the first huawei do more well the camera of huawei is and was way better than samsungs which is literally joke in comparison imo the mate was way better though as it folded differently still both companies have different strenghts after all id still say foldables arent ready and are just too expensive for what they actually offer normal flagships are still the way to go imho
Huawei,Mate X2,do not understand the haters here this is an experimental technology that is actually star more well we hated apple also for copying something and pretending they are the first huawei do something similar and should not get the same apple also raised the average price of phones when they released the iphone but at least there is new tech use of sensors are not new but the combination of sensors which improves the experience for the user with the release of face id huawei is raising the price for the foldables for what copying samsung minor tweaks on the body size and screen and rearranging camera what joke
Huawei,Mate X2,design looks promising its not ip so including mm jack would have been better oomah battery with fast charge hz oled display kirin ooo solid competitor to samsung lg other folding phones lacking google services can affect its sales but for me personally its not an issue because can install google services in huawei devices
Huawei,Mate X2,lmfao only gb ram no options for gb ram my sultra gb gb ram blows this out off more it is nearly impossible to make folding phone with that performance because folding phones are not so advanced it is not focused on being the fastest phone but still has flagship specs
Huawei,Mate X2,mate isnt low midrange its meant to be fookin flagship yes ofc it is had not say it isnt
Huawei,Mate X2,have pro and still with android think we will not receive the newest version sadly yes received emui and its based on android
Huawei,Mate X2,for their low and maybe midrangers yes but with their flagship they doing good mate isnt low midrange its meant to be fookin flagship
Huawei,Mate X2,just another great example of china copying someone elses work when will they ever make more you have been using paper for years go invent something useful for humanity make history
Huawei,Mate X2,its folded better has better camera set up better outer screen for any reason the main sc more just another great example of china copying someone elses work when will they ever make something original even their pathetic aircraft industry is copy of the west and russia
Huawei,Mate X2,can you name one aspect of this phone that makes it copycat this is replica of galaxy fold lol
Huawei,Mate X2,awesome
Huawei,Mate X2,indeed can you name one aspect of this phone that makes it copycat
Huawei,Mate X2,zfold exactly
Huawei,Mate X2,what fold exists indeed
Huawei,Mate X2,it takes huaweis nm which is the same size as nano sim am in china and made my rd visit to big huawei center today fact is that to get you need to add storage card the phone has only been released in the huawei centre has no knowledge of any delivery time on or if this is planned if this is it then it is either sims at or sim and storage card to get to not problem in the westbut sims for foreigner in china is almost necessity
Huawei,Mate X2,seems only and to get you have to add storage card does anybody know if you can more it takes huaweis nm which is the same size as nano sim
Huawei,Mate X2,question only do or will the make or is this it with either with simsor you can add storage card but then only use one sim anybody know
Huawei,Mate X2,compare it to the mate and then tell me it is better like the zfold better also takes nice photos
Huawei,Mate X2,did you not see that had mentioned for other brands but it is available the fold not in work probably just missunderstanding
Huawei,Mate X2,gb ram my sultra has gb ram and its cheaper okay then just fold it show us how great is that
Huawei,Mate X2,lol device released just week zero reviews zero hand ons videos test and for you its more its folded better has better camera set up better outer screen for any reason the main screen itself folded with very minim bending marks use you logic pls
Huawei,Mate X2,can you please visit doctor then what about zfold did you not see that had mentioned for other brands
Huawei,Mate X2,wdym the zfold takes amazing photos compare it to the mate and then tell me it is better
Huawei,Mate X2,does the fold have any of what mentioned let me give clue no and since samsung mad more wdym the zfold takes amazing photos
Huawei,Mate X2,copycat of what dont see any foldable with the incredibly designed hinge that minimises the more zfold
Huawei,Mate X2,it just copycat nothing surprising here copycat of what dont see any foldable with the incredibly designed hinge that minimises the crease and lets the phone to close flat like that in any other foldable but the moto one but its not even close and have seen any other foldable with actual flagship worthy cameras yeah me neither
Huawei,Mate X2,there are currently no available folding displays that support hz just yet available for br more can you please visit doctor then what about zfold
Huawei,Mate X2,most likely ufs but since this is their ultimate flagship guess they might as well ad more yes
Huawei,Mate X2,dennisk feb think they mean unknown most likely ufs but since this is their ultimate flagship guess they might as well add sfs from the mate pro
Huawei,Mate X2,can someone please tell huawei that hz is better than hz because think that they are more there are currently no available folding displays that support hz just yet available for brands samsung however are currently working on their own hz folding display
Huawei,Mate X2,is nobody gonna talk about how theres no front camera on the tablet screen congrats huawei more srsly lmao samsung diehard fan
Huawei,Mate X2,you switch from flagship to flagship lmao what waste he never talked about switching back its you who talked about switching without realising him
Huawei,Mate X2,is ufs equal to ufs think they mean unknown
Huawei,Mate X2,mate is the best of all foldable smartphones released to date if you can accept its thickn more you mean it was from april android will be removed from all huawei devices and it will be replaced with hamrony no thank you
Huawei,Mate X2,at this point the lowest priced mate unit available online is cny
Huawei,Mate X2,mate porsche rs design is better deal the only advantage this thing has is it can fold
Huawei,Mate X2,and the copycat master is there huawei always copying samsung and apple remember when more logically the outward folding screen is the most effective and the best way in creating folding phone you just need one set up of rear camera that also working as selfie shutter have more versatility and also as great as the rear camera quality bcoz theyre the same you got one screen that actually very flexible about size bigger for tablet folded for normal phone and theyre basically has the same quality no more wasteful extra outer screen or too many camera set up we all know that the outward folding screen is risky and we have to be realistic during its development st gen huawei mate the flexible display industry was not as advanced as it is today but until this time the durable flexible screen was not existed yet so were all starting to worry about its durability right it was normal and people started blaming it after that huawei change them into inward folding screen and then people blaming it again just because of their competitor already have phone like that one like seriously dude at this point samsung fold phone was very great its even cheaper and probably more familiar and aslo niche but if theyre having real competitor the only one that ready for it was huawei and both have the and side so could you stop spread hates my friend
Huawei,Mate X2,as of feb am the preorders for this phone are as follows huaweis official online shopping center vmall more than units jd more than units not sure of the numbers from the other two major ecommerce sites sunning and alibaba total at least million units the demand is way higher than the supply unless you preorder you are unlikely to get one even if you preorder there is still good possibility that you will not be able to get one to be on the safe side you will need to preorder it with full payment cny and up it is good thing to see such an expensive foldable phone in such high demand
Huawei,Mate X2,switched to ultra from the pro biggest mistake of my life have already had to more you switch from flagship to flagship lmao what waste
Huawei,Mate X2,huawei have been working on the mate for years how would they be able to tweak zfold more waaw in years they came up with something is out for almost years yea they wasted so much on rd lol and its weird to compare it with an old competitor its true competition is coming soon so lets see how these small differences are worth years gap
Huawei,Mate X2,have you seen the bezels on the edges that isnt ratio only bezeless is still better than having an camera inside
Huawei,Mate X2,mohammedalthwadi feb this is stupid when you take last years design from another company all you need to do more huawei have been working on the mate for years how would they be able to tweak zfold flaws in less than months think about that for moment zfold front screen is still tall and thin like its predecessor unlike mate that looks like normal size smartphone the wedge design is so that you can comfortably hold it with one hand where the main cameras are huawei said that this design completely eliminate the crease problem only reducing it by also small stones sand and coins will have fun inside zfold gap
Huawei,Mate X2,until when without google services looks like its time to change to another brands
Huawei,Mate X2,huawei had very nice smartphones quality but with out google the price too high now im usin more switched to ultra from the pro biggest mistake of my life have already had to switch out the ultra once for replacement because the phone was overheating if you are getting the exynos id reconsider ive had terrible experience not to mention having to buy another usb charger and if you use the huawei one dont be surprised if it takes over hours to fully charge it all the best
Huawei,Mate X2,ill just wait for this technology to get commodified like the rest of the smartphone market apart from the screen which isnt worth its the same as regular smartphone so with midrange specs really no need to go higher these days should be reasonable
Huawei,Mate X2,use the huawei from begging but now is too expensive for huawei without google play and think they must to think little bit when they put this price anyway is phone not car or house
Huawei,Mate X2,is lot for device with no google services
Huawei,Mate X2,the whole world is full of corrupt people every country is run my corrupt politicians that more but does it really matter countries depend on each and if use the mentality of saying country must use its own resources most of the countries will not develop
Huawei,Mate X2,phone right now it selling in china gb version
Huawei,Mate X2,xiaomi and huawei are the best phones ever only apple and samsung sheeps dont understand dont forgot oneplus
Huawei,Mate X2,its fold with no google services and amazing camera
Huawei,Mate X2,another fail from huawei the whole point of foldable is to make the phone smaller even when folded this thing is still phablet that unfolds into another phablet
Huawei,Mate X2,thats why literalle millions of people are desperately trying to get admitted to more probably from an american source
Huawei,Mate X2,galaxy fold indeed though the bigger display is undisturbed by notch and punched holes
Huawei,Mate X2,ive seen the unboxing of this folding mate from chinese source has complete quad camera and it has periscope you can take selfie with its back camera meanwhile you see your image in the front screen clearly much better than bump display in rumored mi ultra the lack is only trump google services
Huawei,Mate X2,far better design than the fold the folded screen is like any smartphone out there th more this is stupid when you take last years design from another company all you need to do is basically just give it some tweaks which any company can then release it and say its better seriously well even though they got the design made for them and they got whole year to put their twist to it its still not on bar internally and it has no protection like utg and the bezels inside are huge the way its thick and thin is weird and not useful it will make it heavier on one side and that is weird their hinge idea of tucking the screenis literally motorolas implementation so not original and it didnt hold dust and fine particles out oh yes when saw live images of the device just assumed that huaweis claims are all lies lol the device has the worst crease ive ever seen in all the folds and can simply go look lol its terrible cuz there are multiple creases lol yup huawei said theres no creases but theres and its actually not resistance to any of that its plastic it will get damaged soo easily with nails and coins ugh maybe just like the fold its self healing but it definitely can be scratched easily and the most important thing is the fold is soon to be announced and that is its true competitor which is gonna be better and cheaper and more durable so its nice that huawei is giving samsung competition but its clear whos the influencer and the winner
Huawei,Mate X2,you say the battery is small yet the zfold had the same exact battery capacity and this has more its fast enough and safer for the battery dont think ill get rid of pricey phone in years and atst dont want the battery to be damaged faster so really wont consider such high charging speed for the long term actually most of the time disable fast charging and keep it at watt trust me from years of experience them its literally mind blowing how battery get damaged fast when its on fast charging apple isnt cheap and if they know its safe they wouldve brought fast charging years ago not an apple user but its factual fast chargers are just marketing numbers that chinese brands uses to look better and most of the people using their stuff usually dont hold to their devices in the long term anyways cant imagine myself looking for battery replacement for this device in or years its crazy to me
Huawei,Mate X2,oh yes it is huge difference thats why literalle millions of people are desperatel more thats why literalle millions of people are desperately trying to get admitted to live usa and practically nobody except for north korean defectors desire to go to china your source being
Huawei,Mate X2,seems like even huawei realized that an outwardfolding solution is not good idea we all know that this is copy of the samsung galaxy fold but it is better idea when compared to the previous mate and xs
Huawei,Mate X2,how is it any different than being controlled by the us government oh yes it is huge difference thats why literalle millions of people are desperately trying to get admitted to live usa and practically nobody except for north korean defectors desire to go to china there must be reason which happens to be how brutal the dictatorship is so it is really most undesirable thing that company is ruledowneddirectedcontrolled by sucj tyrant entity
Huawei,Mate X2,because they are controlled by the chinese goverment who can trust them everybody apart from those who have been fooled by us media and propaganda
Huawei,Mate X2,xiaomi is also chinese company but dont see nobody complaining the whole world is full of corrupt people every country is run my corrupt politicians that way everyone should just stick to using things from their own county
Huawei,Mate X2,zamazing
Huawei,Mate X2,rip battery
Huawei,Mate X2,no google play services and they will really charge for this useless brick will you mind that there are no google services if the name is iphone
Huawei,Mate X2,love it just shame that it does have google serivces just go to app gallery and search gspace
Huawei,Mate X2,dont get why people give huawei so much hate and definitely know that its not more because they are controlled by the chinese goverment who can trust them
Huawei,Mate X2,honestly if they are going to create folding phone that looks like this ditch the camera on the exterior screen and keep one in the interior screen same applies to zfold
Huawei,Mate X2,hope this huawei mate launches dont want samsung to completely dominate the foldable more sammy is lazy on their design copied from its predecessor
Huawei,Mate X2,just wait for honor to start releasing their foldables and buy that since it has google services if not then just get fold
Huawei,Mate X2,huawei isnt much better have mate pro which is kinda their flagship and am more for their low and maybe midrangers yes but with their flagship they doing good
Huawei,Mate X2,copy of shamesong fold it is always what huawei does
Huawei,Mate X2,im definitely gonna buy this bought the last one and loved it cant wait to get my hands on this beast am also waiting on my fold
Huawei,Mate X2,the price for the gb version is around huawei is not joking lol
Huawei,Mate X2,best fold phone on the market love huawei
Huawei,Mate X2,agree especially customers will have great benefits if sammy have competition we know alre more huawei isnt much better have mate pro which is kinda their flagship and am on android with december security patch
Huawei,Mate X2,it is launched so get it away from rumor mill
Huawei,Mate X2,we have to go wide how wide so wide that the phone becomes scroll lol if make the wallpaper golden have urself the dragon scroll
Huawei,Mate X2,hi gays
Huawei,Mate X2,inc are massive but still interesting
Huawei,Mate X3,how can the some of the cons be the free fast charger in the box does support pd when they more true bro the writer need to be more balance
Huawei,Mate X3,if only this had google play services do you really need it
Huawei,Mate X3,read in article that imx is paired with ryyb color filter however sony declares imx to be rgbg filter sensor can someone clarify if theres error in the article
Huawei,Mate X3,what does ot have to do with western style china blocks almost all popular western software more nonsense one government nafica has access to every data real time but they are only interested in the data to monitorcontrol all other countries ie so called leaders which is just puppy of course they do not care about your privacy data because you are nobody wake up
Huawei,Mate X3,western style capitalism free markets when our product is better but pretend that our compet more what does ot have to do with western style china blocks almost all popular western software for ages now their government can legally use any data from companies in any way they want and was well aware of that when had huawei phone it is as it is
Huawei,Mate X3,device doesnt even have the latest gen chipset what joke maybe because huawei is being denied access to latest components both hardware software wise meaning android and sg or no phone
Huawei,Mate X3,classic greedy huawei half the phone twice the price they always think the consumer is stup more see you have no idea what youre talking about this phone is by far the only foldable pushing the envelope where samsung is basically releasing the same galaxy fold years in row with midrange cameras and ridiculously narrow cover screen not to mention plebeian charging im not even gonna talk about google with their bezels from and their rebadged exynos chip no gms can be reinstalled within minutes after the first boot if you dont know how to do it then its on you this phone offers twice the camera performance and half the thickness of the competitors so maybe asking more isnt such bs next time please do the thinking before the writing
Huawei,Mate X3,nm card is not cons its superior than all other brand flagships except sony
Huawei,Mate X3,unfortunately like all huawei mobile devices the only real con is the lack of gms most others are nitpicks and wouldnt be picked up by the masses sucks the us felt so threatened they had to resort to such tactics as hampering technological innovations for all wish the world wasnt so dependent on google even though its not their fault
Huawei,Mate X3,and it works just fine is there google
Huawei,Mate X3,just install gbox and use google as normal on the mate and it works just fine
Huawei,Mate X3,thats staggering amount of cons for review
Huawei,Mate X3,now what to do should buy it or not is it really good someone answer me have you used huawei phone after the embargo or can you use nongoogle phone if yes you can buy it without thinking
Huawei,Mate X3,how is the nm storage is con at least they are giving us an option its con because you spend extra on card thats useless outside of your phone
Huawei,Mate X3,old cpu its hardly ancient the average user wouldnt even know the di more they certainly would when even gsmarena points out stuttering in daily usage
Huawei,Mate X3,stars despite the plethora of cons last years chip without no google play services and an asking price unreasonable for whats on offer the rating system here really starts to confuse me it makes no sense
Huawei,Mate X3,it is good model but without hard to select it
Huawei,Mate X3,design is insanely amazing and unbelievable unfortunately the lack of google services and an more old cpu its hardly ancient the average user wouldnt even know the difference between this and the current gen
Huawei,Mate X3,im super concerned that huawei has fallen short on two things that theyve always done right these past years high refresh rate and color accuracy its sign that these small things could potentially mean more phones could release soon with compromises in these small things
Huawei,Mate X3,such shame google still wont allow huawei google services guess there is reason why they on anything made by google dang
Huawei,Mate X3,to be fair its ultimately still workaround solution rather than native implementation more plenty of countries dont even use native gms also isnt as necessary as many think it is
Huawei,Mate X3,right so no google services is western issue just because you need google services doesnt more they wont sell that great in china either simply because anyone there with enough money will just buy samsung or an iphone for the brand recognition thats how the market works the average joe doesnt have the money for it so he buys budget phone which huawei sell well ive had and still own pro they made good affordable phones but they werent perfect because no phone is flawless ui was meh cameras were good in pro mode most users just point and shoot so its irrelevant proccessing power was ok build quality was ok battery life was really good and thats how you sum up the huawei experience other than being slightly slimmer this has nothing else to set it apart from the sea of foldables in china theres too much competition in the home market and europe is bust with no google plus the price tag and those are facts
Huawei,Mate X3,interesting to see their working solution to have google apps including the accounts not eve more you have point about mentioning gbox in the review have added it to the software section however it remains an imperfect solution that is hard to recommend or fully trust for that matter
Huawei,Mate X3,omg its poco rip off
Huawei,Mate X3,in some areas this is the best hardware in book foldable but its going to need more than slightly bigger screen to compete with the many of you here are spec chasers you dont own foldable and you have no intention of buying one so logically bigger screen means better device in reality going by reddit comments and surveys owners of the are split down the middle on their preference flip owners arent even fully onboard with the bigger screen expected on the flip
Huawei,Mate X3,no hdr certification for device over joke of the century
Huawei,Mate X3,they are going to sell like donuts with those prices hahahahaha and with the disadvantage they have
Huawei,Mate X3,bro the price is frickin too expensive tho but the design is quite nice
Huawei,Mate X3,while im not fan of foldable phones find it impressive that huawei can still manage to put its own nm card slot on this phone its still ironic to see this being the most recent foldable phone with external storage support can see why its impossible to put the headphone jack on foldable phones but cant see the same thing with the microsdnm card slot after all there are lots of space for it
Huawei,Mate X3,hi please did anyone using mate experience heating issues oc battery temperature more reach that temperature only on turbo charge or demanding games
Huawei,Mate X3,not that much
Huawei,Mate X3,had this phone for month now hardware and design was top notch slim and light but software specially without google services makes it undesirable apps crash every now and then hope it improves soon via updates though
Huawei,Mate X3,why so expensive in amazon price like our country has huawei official and it only costs more sounds like third party seller price not from amazon check on who is selling shipping the device
Huawei,Mate X3,no volye and no wifi calling features doesnt work much in india without wifi calling since networks are very bad in india
Huawei,Mate X3,nah its like waiting for apple go get powerpc processor back by the time kirin comes more nobody can tell huawei is making progress in semiconductor manufacturing one day it could reach the level of current competitors such as tsmc then tehy will be able to produce their kirin chips on their own and as kirin chips were great in the past they would surely be even better in the future
Huawei,Mate X3,if this had google play services it would be an excellent foldable no if it had google services it will be an ultimate spy phone stop talking non sense its the fact that google has been sued in multiple countries and there is no good reason to trust their proprietary codes
Huawei,Mate X3,googl play gbox
Huawei,Mate X3,previously had the samsung fold and however am pleased switched to the mate find it pleasure to use
Huawei,Mate X3,really great phone but if only it had google play services
Huawei,Mate X3,you guys are right better wait until kirin is back theres no great tech in smartp more nah its like waiting for apple go get powerpc processor back by the time kirin comes back it will be outdated or too slow to compete that the other will gradually beat it just like how intel beaten ibm
Huawei,Mate X3,that could have bought used car with that money
Huawei,Mate X3,yes vivo fold fold and fold have under display fingerprint display for both screen more cheaper but unavailable ya very good choice
Huawei,Mate X3,same just waiting for their kirin flagship socs to return as have had great experience with more you guys are right better wait until kirin is back theres no great tech in smartphone wout huawei
Huawei,Mate X3,but why the high prices though because the quality build material they used on huawei phones unlike sammy not even one year the screen is having some burnspecially in flagship model
Huawei,Mate X3,why aed is nothing new only have big display thats all lol are you from india
Huawei,Mate X3,no snapdragon gen not huge difference between the
Huawei,Mate X3,only dollar for tech for when you have too much money and want to timetravel back to whats the point of having mobile phone when services is not availalbe in your country and you are not using any data
Huawei,Mate X3,poor battery capacity laughing at samsung fold mah
Huawei,Mate X3,do you happen to know any foldable phone with an underdisplay fingerprint scanner vivo fold dual ultrasonic underdisplay fingerprint sensors
Huawei,Mate X3,eur lol
Huawei,Mate X3,the depth when folded is mm not mm pls change
Huawei,Mate X3,and its useless nothing works security apps for banks just forget it what makes it uselss isnt it way ahead of the sht ppl usually releases
Huawei,Mate X3,nobody will buyphanthom fold is only kand same specslol
Huawei,Mate X3,who can by it in this price
Huawei,Mate X3,so this is the only fold with the least crease when its lighter will consider fold
Huawei,Mate X3,specs with foldable screen for good luck you really have no clue what youre talking about right
Huawei,Mate X3,euro with side mounted fingerprint sensor give me break do you happen to know any foldable phone with an underdisplay fingerprint scanner
Huawei,Mate X3,nowadays huawei smartphone are working with play store but not directly at the first it needs more but why the high prices though
Huawei,Mate X3,why not replicate this with honor brand so that it can have play store with larger market thi more nowadays huawei smartphone are working with play store but not directly at the first it needs other app to support play store you guy can try in you tube
Huawei,Mate X3,google play will always be your stumbler do something about it soonest the truth is everyone who loves your phones are waiting for your reconciliation with google play
Huawei,Mate X3,googl play
Huawei,Mate X3,device well put together device as useful as rusty penny in the united states
Huawei,Mate X3,yeah baby
Huawei,Mate X3,yes but currently prefer to go for apple maybe when they get their kirin soc back il more same just waiting for their kirin flagship socs to return as have had great experience with their kirin socs before the bansection no overheat or lags
Huawei,Mate X3,jeeezzz as fan of huawei dont care what your poor stupid ass would say but since am no more well we are not that stupid to pay such high amount for nothingyou are either rich or earned momey from nowhere to pay this high for this phone when you can buy others cheaper and with better spevs
Huawei,Mate X3,come to think of it its big brand again from huawei and its to be noted huawe more yes but currently prefer to go for apple maybe when they get their kirin soc back ill go to buy them but even now think they have better products than samsung and series
Huawei,Mate X3,ever since the rise of huawei the us view it as security threat with no clear more thats just how the us government is its not runned by competent people that is for the benefit of the people rather for corporate elites oligarchs corrupt etc
Huawei,Mate X3,hope to see google play or another software that any other manufacturers can use to heave normal applications google and apple are spying on us for ages dont understand why they should be allowed to use their software made hundreds of test and the results are still showing me that both ios and android is spying and gets my exact location with all location turned off from the software we need petition to let huawei use play store again and
Huawei,Mate X3,wth even the older nm above nm lithography they want to ban wow us really needs to re more ever since the rise of huawei the us view it as security threat with no clear evidences am fan of smartphones except for apple and samsung ofcourse
Huawei,Mate X3,jeez huawei is still pricing foldables as if its when all foldables costed more jeeezzz as fan of huawei dont care what your poor stupid ass would say but since am not fan of foldables or flip phones will never buy this one but yeah just accept you poor ass cannot buy good phone
Huawei,Mate X3,our lovely us president mr joe biden also wants to ban to nm chips but idk if this was more wth even the older nm above nm lithography they want to ban wow us really needs to reform their government or else they will be the next fall after ussr by weaponizing sanctions etc even against small countries
Huawei,Mate X3,wasnt it only euv machines that got banned or uncle sam also banned old duv machines whi more our lovely us president mr joe biden also wants to ban to nm chips but idk if this was true because some article states otherwise another youtube video made by chinafocus said that japan is willing to provide lithography machines to china another is the us government also wants to impose total ban of us parts on china not just on huawei so this means if this is true then we could only see smartphone brands sony apple samsung and google which ofcourse this move was heavily oppose by intel qualcoom and amd since majority of their chip buyers are from china the united states really wants to kill every business opponent do they
Huawei,Mate X3,the hisilicon kirin chip may take years to be produced again because their is another pr more wasnt it only euv machines that got banned or uncle sam also banned old duv machines which is what was used to make nm though think they should have enough of them to reverse engineer create much more improved version for mass production
Huawei,Mate X3,maybe this is already their nm breakthru chip being introduced hope they start mass producin more the hisilicon kirin chip may take years to be produced again because their is another problem have read an article stating that the netherlands asml company will no longer supply lithography machines to china if you dont know lithography machines they are needed to produce chips and without it huawei would likely be using snapdragon chipsets which is not bad but they are not as optimize as the kirin chips when it comes to huawei phones since huawei is exclusively using kirin chips not the snapdragon ones the reason why asml is not selling machines to china you guess it its because of mr bidens good ol democracy campaign against china
Huawei,Mate X3,am hoping for the latter one hoping to see huawei phone with maybe this is already their nm breakthru chip being introduced hope they start mass producing bring back the superior kirin socs on their flagships midranges
Huawei,Mate X3,mostlikely typo unless huawei is using their own chip then maybe am hoping for the latter one hoping to see huawei phone with
Huawei,Mate X3,this has eh mostlikely typo unless huawei is using their own chip then maybe
Huawei,Mate X3,glad huawei is starting to push nm card this year hopefully in more phones
Huawei,Mate X3,sd gen still killer chip dont know why some people complain correct however the problem is sd gen was prone to overheating issues and was poorly optimised due to samsung supplying those chips therefore although its modern chip its been cannibalised in terms of actual potential thats why tsmc is the only company who should be dealing with qualcomm chips as theyre the only ones competent to do so look at the sd gen for samsung it was supplied and optimised by tsmc and nothing is coming close to that chip in every angle
Huawei,Mate X3,how is possible huawei is giving on folded phones chip and other dont
Huawei,Mate X3,there are zero apps that trully support perfect squares do you enjoy black bars jn your apps more foldables make sense you dont
Huawei,Mate X3,pixels aaahhh huawei is that close on making perfect square foldable phone th more there are zero apps that trully support perfect squares do you enjoy black bars jn your apps even this screen is only in name almost inches in practice its inches when unfolded because thats the amount of space youre going to be able to utilize which kills the point of having foldable in the first place most high end phones are almost inch already lol foldables will start making sense if theyd start having inch and above usable space when unfolded only one managed to that mix fold the original and it was otherwise flop so yeah the whole space is till work in progress to say the least lol
Huawei,Mate X3,it has normal size when its folded this is what we need not this enormous
Huawei,Mate X3,doa yesteryear chip plus punch hole on inner screen kill it please its barely yesteryear its still more than powerful for most people theres no point buying phones with latest chipset if you only going to use it for social media
Huawei,Mate X3,its huawei still has no google play services what shame tell the us government that
Huawei,Mate X3,in google still cant implement gms to new huawei phones what shame let google more unless youve been living under rock the us put huawei on blacklist and that prevented anyone from doing business with them so if google allows them to use their services theyll face the wrath of the government
Huawei,Mate X3,its poco nfcpro elite version
Huawei,Mate X3,where is face unlock
Huawei,Mate X3,so many huawei lovers here
Huawei,Mate X3,hmmm foldables expensive but can be broken by just bare fingers tho just wanna comment more thought was the only one who noticed iti guessed they did for us to notice it
Huawei,Mate X3,why do people need foldable phone well honestly nobody needs foldable no one had problem until foldables came in and then it became just thing to bragg about oh have foldable phone that can break in half like piece of cardboard phone companies are just bored and dont know what other unnecessary things to add to smartphones take for example the samsung transparent phone they working on seriously who asked for that and what are the benefits mean making something like that would be step in technology ofc but it is completely useless and unnecessary
Huawei,Mate X3,this font is desperate on the website too
Huawei,Mate X3,this foldable is looking good in many ways very thin the most lightweight of the foldables one of the few that has wireless charging one of the few that is ip water resistant and the only one has the highest display resolution aside from xs way too expensive but this is ideally what like to see from highend foldable
Huawei,Mate X3,lol can pick up fold with gb for would rather to over this overpriced phone any day gen and harmonyos for goodness me
Huawei,Mate X3,yeah and it costs bands and it comes with an outdated chipset bruh and thats not the only issue from what can see here
Huawei,Mate X3,the camera design is like they took the poco nfcpro and brought in upgrades
Huawei,Mate X3,it is as expensive as good laptop but other than that it is fantastic just wish they make cover display smaller just like
Huawei,Mate X3,too pricey
Huawei,Mate X3,mp periscope with mm equivalent focal length that sounds interesting for foldable
Huawei,Mate X3,foldable smartphone are over people waiting rollup smartphone
Huawei,Mate X3,come on people give huawei chance atleast theyre giving expendable storage
Huawei,Mate X3,gen yeah and
Huawei,Mate X3,folding phone with card slot but its nanomemory freakin huawei
Huawei,Mate X5,perfect smartphone foldable mate tb collector edition
Huawei,Mate X5,now all huawei gotta do is remove the chinese gov backdoor but that wont ever happen like google doesnt sell your date right
Huawei,Mate X5,everybody knows the only reason this phone is even being considered is that chinese people don more calm down have the mate and its an amazing phone used samsung and oneplus mate so far of them the best foldable until now
Huawei,Mate X5,huawei mate
Huawei,Mate X5,the only issue have about four balls is that its really hard to fold them when youre blind its hard to fold them partly because were not used to them like huawei they use different os thank goodness theyre also teaming up with xiaomi because theyre using emi dont know if emuy is owned by xiaomi but it seems likely so because they have been using it since the beginning
Huawei,Mate X5,samsung had fear of losing its position at number one thats why they banned huawei samsungs trash most boring phone ever huawei and oneplus are so much better im still using mate and my ultra sits not being used because how boring it is
Huawei,Mate X5,and also because huawei did not let the us gov to put backdoor on their devices now all huawei gotta do is remove the chinese gov backdoor but that wont ever happen
Huawei,Mate X5,will give you short review from this samsung fanboy samsung are the best other more samsung had fear of losing its position at number one thats why they banned huawei
Huawei,Mate X5,could you give short review of the phone will give you short review from this samsung fanboy samsung are the best others are trash
Huawei,Mate X5,why do you consider huawei to be trash what are you waiting for from samsung fanboy
Huawei,Mate X5,im also waiting for the global version to come out hope the price wont be too more if they decide to launch it worldwide
Huawei,Mate X5,be far ahead
Huawei,Mate X5,people dont get excited first read chinese reviews on weibo live in china and teste more how much money have you got that reward may be enormous
Huawei,Mate X5,when is global price
Huawei,Mate X5,will there be global release chinese dealers are selling it for price online we need glob more im also waiting for the global version to come out hope the price wont be too high hope the european launch price will be good
Huawei,Mate X5,probably use it as second phone with wifi from the first phone is that illegal
Huawei,Mate X5,can we use this in us was told carriers in us ban lots of chinese phones like huawei hon more what pity that us people cant use so many chinese mobile chinese brands launch so many phones each year for all level customers however us people not included due to us ban
Huawei,Mate X5,according to the corresponding data of it home the scanning results of electron microscope show that kirin has about transistors per square millimeter with density between tsmc np and
Huawei,Mate X5,no just see the cpu score is very match to snapdragon gen even mem and ux scores are more yeah but when compared both on version just worried bit but we should wait
Huawei,Mate X5,they cant bring this and the mate series outside of china because of the new chipset more lol hope they do and forward other innovations as well without needing to cooperate with the slimey empire of doublespeak
Huawei,Mate X5,more like around respectively as cpu uix are better scored by kirin if it is more if gpu is higher than the rest that would be overkill unless if the system took full advantage of its gpu
Huawei,Mate X5,expect the maleoon will have gpu score no just see the cpu score is very match to snapdragon gen even mem and ux scores are match to snapdragon gen also snapdragon cpu mem ux score is not even higher than kirin snapdragon is just lucky to get gpu score while the gpu score in kirin is not detected at all when everything cpu mem ux is as powerful as snapdragon gen then gpu should not be that low
Huawei,Mate X5,like this phone
Huawei,Mate X5,my favourite phone
Huawei,Mate X5,have been waiting to buy another huawei just cos of the kirin chipset and huawei itself too more hope the models released next year will meet your expectations the series will probably offer another innovation like foldable models and from what ive seen the mate does good job in terms of camera performance the mate is probably similar if we can see models with new kirin processors globally would love to buy them
Huawei,Mate X5,huawei you are strong god bless you
Huawei,Mate X5,during the period when huawei worked with tsmc kirin processors were leading many innovations more have been waiting to buy another huawei just cos of the kirin chipset and huawei itself too as for now am wait ing for huawei to make another minimum of optical fps like on the ppro and it should be available in the next series mate series now that their kirin chipset is back
Huawei,Mate X5,ok its so good
Huawei,Mate X5,youre posting the same rubbish on my very huawei article thats yours
Huawei,Mate X5,why snapdragon outperforms kirin at every step no overall kirin outperforms in many aspects maybe snapdragon was the leading tech in but now its due time another takes the challenge to topple them samsung tried but pathetically limped away at corner with its exynos deliberately crippled by themselves so as not to outperform the us sanctions if not samsung would also be one of the best few now with their own creates same for sony phones before the degraded to current pathetic state where even their own citizens dont wanna use them but go for iphone instead
Huawei,Mate X5,the kirin just lets it all down its just marginal upgrade from kirin more youre posting the same rubbish on my very huawei article
Huawei,Mate X5,china is brilliant really to be able to bypass all the us sanctions is not an easy thing to do by the way love how this phone looks
Huawei,Mate X5,they are making progress give them time these things dont happen in day after all the more well then lets see
Huawei,Mate X5,too early device
Huawei,Mate X5,its battery technology is great with carbon would give good sot discharge slow carbon is light material am pretty sure this thing would weigh almost nothing
Huawei,Mate X5,mp
Huawei,Mate X5,this colour is absolutely beautiful better than the silver colour changing colour on the mate looks amazing
Huawei,Mate X5,wow
Huawei,Mate X5,small battery its more than find nz flod and almost equal to honor yes its small for inch display but it is also larger than its competitors
Huawei,Mate X5,interesting would love to see how that chipset performs and how efficient it is
Huawei,Mate X5,small battery
Huawei,Mate X5,wish this will be global they cant bring this and the mate series outside of china because of the new chipset enabling
Huawei,Mate X6,gbox is not the best solution because its an emulator microg allows gms dependent apps to run natively
Huawei,Mate X6,imho inexcuseable review there is not single word about panoramas let alone any samples from them there is no information on whether you can even get panoramas with the ultrawide lens or the teles agree that such information should be posted by manufacturers on their websites in all languages and by law because prospective purchasers otherwise have no idea what they will be getting for all that money but as they dont and as they dont supply it when you phone and ask them nicely and have asked xiaomi huawei samsung etc must beg gsmarena the worlds best website for mobile phone reviews please to recommence panorama reviews with samples and info about which lenses on which phone can make them and how big and what is the actual resolution etc because well this would complete your reviews and our satisfactions
Huawei,Mate X6,because they dont have any reason to apple through foxconn provides ton of jobs for the ch more since the iphone was introduced their phone technology has always been step behind when huawei was already in the market the iphone still slept with their phone since the technology exhilaration of huawei in usa tech companies push the usa government to acquire this technology the blockage and the arrest of huawei executive all derive because huawei refused to open their high technology to usa corporations all the effort was simply to slow down huawei
Huawei,Mate X6,phones without variable aperture will be lagging in low light lot since shooting with and is not small difference so is shooting in daylight with small aperture without focus hunting zoom is very close to that samsung got now making it good enough as follow up to bar phones not quite better but beyond what others offer shooting with high quality without digital zoom huawei offers quote range from mm to zoom if were to suggest wouldnt use multi bayer in tele lens so there is higher reach and better raw output when digitally zoomed in unless they come with better optical zoom that is wish that folds will have pen support tho if tech allows in the future at least
Huawei,Mate X6,usa killed huawei but china is not killing apple why because they dont have any reason to apple through foxconn provides ton of jobs for the chinese also if apple actually exited the country china wont have any source to copy off from in short apple existence in china benefitted china while huaweis existence in the us didnt benefit the us much
Huawei,Mate X6,good lord gimped phone that costs as much as regular nongimped phone brought to you by company that is likely spying on you through your as expensive gimped phone oh and alot of stuff wont work and the stuff you can get working through workarounds wont work as well as it should lol oh boy where do buy one does it come with salty eyeball poker as well
Huawei,Mate X6,about the major issues you should know that with small layers microg or gbox you recover all google functions the processor is probably equivalent to sd gen and that should not be problem for any applications huawei decided to be totally independent from foreign technologies so these are not issues this is the top foldable full stop and these devices are expensive
Huawei,Mate X6,still no proper app support still not hd or hdr streaming still using midrange chipset me more what are you even talking about have used huawei pro pro pura ultra all global versions emui for years and did not have those problems in russia huawei phones works better than any other companies huawei forever
Huawei,Mate X6,law and order freedom of speech grow up this phone is pure garbage most pathetic and useless comment of the year and weve barely started it good job
Huawei,Mate X6,tim cook has already said that apple cant completely decouple from china because they re more usa killed huawei but china is not killing apple why
Huawei,Mate X6,roflmao dude id love to hear where you thi your parts are designed and built in for all more harvesting more money and less effort the answer is made in china it is smart move another how to become rich implementation no doubt on quality as it complies to critical requirements
Huawei,Mate X6,lets do humanity favor ban huawei tp link xiaomi the chinese tp link managed to create chaos huge cve list products full of security holes is your product not years old return it and get your money back
Huawei,Mate X6,sure but you can trust the americans law and order freedom of speech grow up this phone is pure garbage
Huawei,Mate X6,in the description you confirm the compatibility with so your review is wrong
Huawei,Mate X6,guys iphone isnt in the list accidently entered my comment iphone isnt in the list in this room it belongs to other room top phone sorry for being late to make correction
Huawei,Mate X6,the more exposure huawei foldables get the less control they will have over reviews and user more it proofs the false advertisement sometime work best to boost sales however it is not as simply as it looks like most people have already been aware who is samsung so far what meant here is brand like infinix should not do the same practice as it would just cost them badly but iphone might have same experience just like samsung their famous name have increased peoples faith that direct their tought to choose their product without thinking to much
Huawei,Mate X6,its emui but basically emui and harmonyos are the same thing their aesthetics are basically the same but harmonyos is way more refined when it comes to how smooth it is in my experience ive used an emui pro and harmonyos pro and that was probably the biggest difference between them
Huawei,Mate X6,the simplest android appears like marvel in comparison
Huawei,Mate X6,the chip performs surprisingly well all things considered looking forward to what theyll release next
Huawei,Mate X6,funny how this got rating even though theres more cons on the list also the kirin isnt even at the alreadybad tensor levels yeah know huawei has been banned and this is good progress but this is literally sgd it cant be that high just get an honor magic instead its far cheaper and is just better
Huawei,Mate X6,heard the latest harmonyos are still using android codings and some other says its ful more buyers in china have choice of the phone running either harmonyos android or harmonyos next not android everyone else just emui android
Huawei,Mate X6,this phone shouldnt have got more than score considering the poor battery life half baked os and poor performance
Huawei,Mate X6,so is this phone harmony os or emui because in the huaweis website it says emui but here more huawei phones released in china run harmonyos and phones released in other places run emui still dont know why they did that because neither emui or harmonyos have google services both are compatible with android apps harmonyos next is the new huawei proprietary operating system that is not compatible with android apps
Huawei,Mate X6,there are highlighted things that out of my sight in my earlier comment for this model the things are the support for the screen layer made of carbon fiber that is famous in formula car technology which is capable to prolong the screen after numeruos flipunflip activities along with the most recent silicon carbon battery technology since it has been forced to achieve the fastest possible charging time
Huawei,Mate X6,google only care about profit margins pixels since pixel have either low build quality or more they obtained lesson learned from the book named how to become rich hmmmm
Huawei,Mate X6,an interesting and bold step that huawei took on the processor they introduced kirin as the core for its device instead of common chipsets in the market gsmarena has conducted test to it and it seems it passed the test already as gsmarena didnt raise on it any negative wording am seeking it become great rival over mediatek or even snapdragon in the future and provide budget friendly chipset alternative as for chipset developed by samsung believe exynos wont allow its chipset will be easily relegated for me the intriguing matter about processor is it rarely comes with equal clock speed on all cores where it absolutely can increase the performance stability
Huawei,Mate X6,no emui is absolutely different thing from harmonyos harmonyos is chinese selfdeveloped os more so is this phone harmony os or emui because in the huaweis website it says emui but here it says harmony os
Huawei,Mate X6,but emui is android and harmonyos is not right no emui is absolutely different thing from harmonyos harmonyos is chinese selfdeveloped os and emui is an android skin just like oneui oxygenos hyperos and etc because harmonyos uses hongmeng kernel not linux kernel
Huawei,Mate X6,deleted post opinion
Huawei,Mate X6,the mp mode would have looked phenomenal had the optics been sharp across the frame huawei more google only care about profit margins pixels since pixel have either low build quality or poor hardware quality control because of extreme cost cutting tensor is googles way to maintain profit margins when qualcomms flagship chipsets getting more expensive but as always cost cutting seems to be the main agenda
Huawei,Mate X6,too bad that it can barely compete with tensor has no google services and pretty bad battery life as nice at it looks that is just not good enough for what they value it at
Huawei,Mate X6,all these chinese worshippers talk about bit better benchmark number compared to tensor but of course suddenly become blind when it comes to that abysmal battery endurance that lot worse compared to tensor which infamous with bad battery endurance
Huawei,Mate X6,china is years behind on hardware but software is more important this is where it all goes wrong absolutely nothing works
Huawei,Mate X6,even so they go through so many layers of obfuscation to prevent anyone from knowing what the more think there is an additional practical reason behind it they probably want to protect their suppliers making it harder for defense department apple department of commerce and other american government agencies to track those who supply them with components wherever in the world those companies might be they similarly dont go beyond necessary information for chipsets protective glass and other stuff
Huawei,Mate X6,so whats googles excuse for continuing to sell pixels with mediocre cpu performanceefficiency that even sanctioned company like huawei could surpass tensor really is joke of flagship soc if they intend to keep doing this they really should start selling pixels as midrangers instead of pretending like they are somehow remotely competitive with highend offerings from other manufacturers it also feels weird to see such stellar camera performance from foldable the only thing that is holding it back is the uneven sharpness of the lens but the image processing is absolutely superb and easily matches or even surpasses the ultra when it comes to detail rendition at the very centre of the frame digital crop is nothing short of outstanding either
Huawei,Mate X6,httpssocpkcomcpucurvegb the is more efficient than the so smics nm more imagine what their future nm could do
Huawei,Mate X6,they are custom made even so they go through so many layers of obfuscation to prevent anyone from knowing what these sensors are honor used to do the same thing as well though they have improved in the past years
Huawei,Mate X6,infinix is not interesting im waiting for the testreview of the oneplus gsmarena please do the test of the oneplus if it exceeds iqoo in autonomy then its the right choice
Huawei,Mate X6,seeing it perform better cpuwise compared to the tensor is so funny to me is it that difficult for google to improve their processors when huawei is able to understand sanctions
Huawei,Mate X6,huaweis habit of intentionally not revealing the make and size of their sensors should more they are custom made
Huawei,Mate X6,quite laughable that the kirin using ancient nm fabrication and cut off from latest arm instr more just what was about to say didnt expect the kirin to perform this good nor did expect it to surpass the tensor
Huawei,Mate X6,mm physical focal length on telephoto
Huawei,Mate X6,maduros favorite phone right now thought china would hand him oppo or honor instead the best mass produced chinese phones to date but those use american chips often partner with google an american company so the chinese government chose to gift him fullychinese huawei that uses kirin chips fabbed by smic in china as well as chinese operating system harmonyos built from scratch unlike android windows in order to demonstrate how independent china is in attempting to replace american supplychains apps os camera sensors digital appstores its great piece of hardware but dont recommend it if you live outside china or if your workplace heavily relies on american apps most of the world uses american apps os chips fabbed in americancontrolled taiwanese south korean japanese chip foundries
Huawei,Mate X6,im using mate now alongside magic pro for six wonderful monthsi love the phone to moon and back always feel good with it started with huawei and till now true fan for huawei products
Huawei,Mate X6,would glad ly have bought it if it came with an at least periscope optical zoom and digital zoom and better still of there an addition al ip like an ip or apart from that it is already perfect phone design wise both on its front and back and all other features however iam interested in the huawei ultra or mate pro and will most likely buy it or even both provided that they have an at least optical digital zoom
Huawei,Mate X6,love huawei but usd for phone and which is without gms hummmmm you can have google service and other us apps on most of the huawei phone on emui or later you can use rd party apps to install those apps it just not natively preinstall due to sanction and you can blame the us govt for that
Huawei,Mate X6,how long software update in this phone
Huawei,Mate X6,still nothing what are you even talking about
Huawei,Mate X6,what opinion still nothing
Huawei,Mate X6,samsung galaxy zfold is better than huawei mate it legitimately isnt its only better at minor things like the bluetooth version or usb port being instead of or guess gms if you care about that the huawei is better in almost every way in true foldable quality it has better camera it has better display it is significantly thinner etc
Huawei,Mate X6,its your opinion what opinion
Huawei,Mate X6,asked about what lmao samsung galaxy zfold is better than huawei mate
Huawei,Mate X6,no one asked asked about what lmao
Huawei,Mate X6,everything huawei to you is dud really wonder why you bothered to comment this lmao no one asked
Huawei,Mate X6,its an xt ultimate for poor people
Huawei,Mate X6,hi everyone just wonder which is better huawei mate or honor magic for the best folda more honor magic is better in almost every category
Huawei,Mate X6,not nearly as far as youd expect regardless the kirin in here will deliver suffic more if you buy the pixel pro fold maybe when you spend that much money on foldable people tend to expect high end chips if youre fine with it go for it would be disappointed in getting worse performance than some phones that cost half of it also the battery life is straight up garbage yes it is on par with the tensor but the pixel pro fold has much better battery life and afaik even that phones battery life is nothing special having less performance isnt deal breaker when the battery life can make up for it but with this phone you get neither advantage you get worse performance and worse battery life than any other foldable from this generation
Huawei,Mate X6,it trades blows with it also that is just one competitor all others are pretty far ahead not nearly as far as youd expect regardless the kirin in here will deliver sufficient performance for anyone really its not like people wanting to buy foldable want the best performance there is as not many people buy foldables just to play extremely demanding games
Huawei,Mate X6,too slow in comparison to others dude go check the review it literally surpasses the tens more it trades blows with it also that is just one competitor all others are pretty far ahead
Huawei,Mate X6,id say neither foldable is worth it the just cant compete its too slow more too slow in comparison to others dude go check the review it literally surpasses the tensor in performance
Huawei,Mate X6,why huawei worst battery life due to the lack of an adaptive refresh rate feature the device may not dynamically adjust its screen refresh rate based on user interaction for instance some competing models can reduce the refresh rate to as low as hz when the screen is idle or inactive thereby conserving power
Huawei,Mate X6,well keeping in mind the xt ultimate is rather niche device id say that the mate more id say neither foldable is worth it the just cant compete its too slow in comparison to others costs just as much yet simply gives you less the xt is interesting but it has similar flaws aswell as an even more absurd price tag it also is first gen product so it probably will have issues eventually as usual
Huawei,Mate X6,well thats your opinion but most people will disagree with you and do find the regular more foldable phone are useless because of the internal square formate had of them and returned them and now am back to regular phone completely useless their purpose for now is for fashion only not to mention how low their reliability is
Huawei,Mate X6,you dont get it in videos you get bigger black bars top and bottom not to the sides li more tell me you never used foldable phone without telling me will go first
Huawei,Mate X6,dude that new huawei mate is total dud it came out today and it uses harmonyos not more everything huawei to you is dud really wonder why you bothered to comment this lmao
Huawei,Mate X6,if you believe that then wish you good purchase but before you buy it ask if you will more us apart if you buy chinese pack you have in eu the ones that are legally sold everywhere apart from china dont support in us even if you gray import from other brands from china you most likely will miss as they mainly use mmwave
Huawei,Mate X6,has glook at network if you believe that then wish you good purchase but before you buy it ask if you will have in your country to be sure especially if you live in europe or the us
Huawei,Mate X6,nickson dec what do you mean no has glook at network
Huawei,Mate X6,without gok what do you mean no
Huawei,Mate X6,the internal screen does nothing square screens have no use cases outside of photo viewing more well thats your opinion but most people will disagree with you and do find the regular folds useful
Huawei,Mate X6,why no info about cpu eur for this is joke because huawei doesnt officially reveal what chipsets their smartphones have ever since the us sanctions but its most likely kirin here as on the mate series
Huawei,Mate X6,is coming with wps office pc level
Huawei,Mate X6,how did this ting can operate without soc magical
Huawei,Mate Xs,heck no if you gotta spend on phone your better off buying laptop dont get me weong its beautiful phone but at what cost also understand that they give you screen replacement which tells me lot about the quality and standards of the phone heard the original huawei mate xt was being returned back in china by its customers like hotcakes because of cracked screens and hinge issues definitely not good look
Huawei,Mate Xs,this mate xs is so amazing even when fold up the main screen still got lotbbigger than samsung fold and after open the screen still bigger than samsung fold very good for drama and music lover google apps also no problem after install from the official apps love it so much battery not bad also got super fast charge
Huawei,Mate Xs,hr endurance rating oh my such terrible battery life the endurance rating of the mate xs is comparable to the galaxy
Huawei,Mate Xs,one of four main camera is selfie
Huawei,Mate Xs,favourite phones ive ever had been using it for just over year and it still feels brand new
Huawei,Mate Xs,thus phone has several problems its not just the screen look at the battery capacity hz more bro this is foldable phone its hard to put ip rating into it
Huawei,Mate Xs,even though this phone gets lot of hate for its outward facing screen personally li more thus phone has several problems its not just the screen look at the battery capacity hz no watetproof or any ip rating dude its
Huawei,Mate Xs,ridiculous pricing and no google services they must be crazy how far huawei wana fall in mob more you realise that there are workarounds to get gpss on huawei phones my brother has huawei and it is quite easy to get most of the google apps
Huawei,Mate Xs,cant help but think that lg or any other brand can use this phone as an inspiration for their rollable screen smartphone mean the camera and the powervolume button is placed on one side with no bezel or notch or even punchhole interrupting the screen that can provide seamless transition for the rolling screen mechanism
Huawei,Mate Xs,are you joking for inch tablet are you sure about the mate xs is for just tablet
Huawei,Mate Xs,what the for tablet bra they are some something very good if people buy this they ar more what is that if is bit goodmaybe you should put screen instead
Huawei,Mate Xs,sometimes huawei designed nongoogle phone but old huawei phones have google but not new ones learn how huawei design bywhy not huawei made it lets see if the is here or not
Huawei,Mate Xs,just drop it
Huawei,Mate Xs,the mate xs is great device and just an fyi the emui version is
Huawei,Mate Xs,hey which one do you like better pros cons vs both got used galaxy fold from ebay for more go for fold it is better daily phone xs is beautiful but still has no google and it can be trouble sometimes
Huawei,Mate Xs,so true waited year and got my note for lot cheaper and then picked up sony more flagship remains flagship until the successor arrives there after it becomes ex flagship buying old technology is no fun
Huawei,Mate Xs,been using this for well over week now and am thoroughly enjoying it will probably have it for another week really love then versatility true mix of large smartphone and mini tablet the great camera array really completes the experience to looking at the gsm arena battery test doesnt give confidence compared to other smartphones but in my experience this device easily does full day even with large amount of unfolded usage
Huawei,Mate Xs,at the midautumn festival party today sept tencent pcg platform and content group is offering all its staff thousands special holiday gift mate xs cny now this is the kind of company you want to work for
Huawei,Mate Xs,no huawei mate xs will not support gms regardless where you download even if you try to get it back to its previous update
Huawei,Mate Xs,wrong install google play services from uptodown and you will get google apps including youtube no huawei mate xs will not support gms regardless where you download
Huawei,Mate Xs,currently ownn the galaxy fold and the mate xs use the mate xs as my main phone and the more hey which one do you like better pros cons vs both got used galaxy fold from ebay for cant find the mate xs for less then but love the huawei emui way better samsung os sucks have the mate as my daily
Huawei,Mate Xs,for the price of this you can buy flagship phonetablet and donate remaining money to charity so true waited year and got my note for lot cheaper and then picked up sony xz premium as dedicated av library for even cheaper two flagship phones both new in their boxes for less than what the cheapest one cost only few years back and yes am more than happy with what have for now but will look at finding one of these new next year or so
Huawei,Mate Xs,it will get huge success when it has dual boot option with linux as second os which has the ability to run desktop applications autimatic boot on android when folded on linux when unfolded optional then it will called as comphone the price is already exceeded than the phone and laptop combo
Huawei,Mate Xs,the ideal mate xxs sequel kirin which will have out of the gate with more more forget mp no new flaghip sensor till just huawei tradition
Huawei,Mate Xs,they could have taken the advantage of the handlebar and put headphone jack on there but no more true but will you buy it
Huawei,Mate Xs,dont ever made mistake and buy that mobile bought it last april and there was some scratches so went to huawei service provider to change the screen protector based on the warranty they told me we are not able to change it because there will be bubbles and we cannot fix it properly then what shall do after spend that big amount on unreliable mobile
Huawei,Mate Xs,android tablets are garbage no way would pay more than on useless phone like this th more wrong install google play services from uptodown and you will get google apps including youtube
Huawei,Mate Xs,seeing their antutu score is like an sd score and seeing the score from the series more the mate xs uses ufs instead of the ufs on the series also the cooling solution is beefier on the series because theres more room to play with there could also be difference in ram speed but im not sure about that one these combined will give you the score difference you mention so very unlikely its because huawei are cheating again
Huawei,Mate Xs,love this phone and getting google play store and google services installed with little research and know how makes this device million times better
Huawei,Mate Xs,kirin chipset is better than sd seeing their antutu score is like an sd score and seeing the score from the series hmmmm is much the difference between devices carrying the same chipset so huawei is cheating again for the price you are getting the outdated chipset anyway
Huawei,Mate Xs,am not from china but think huawei makes great innovations with which the us cannot compe more definitely agree with that usa is scared not to harm apple so they banned huawei pro user here
Huawei,Mate Xs,nice to have but once the screen bumps sharp object its over and there goes your down the drain the hype ofr having new gadgets last only for week after that youd be looking again for something new believe me am one of those who always aspire for new phones but when got the ultra my hype for phones finally subsides and then have lost interest to any new phones am now so disinterested in phones that sold the ultra and reused phone maybe just reached the point of fullness unless they make phone with laser gunthen there is new hope
Huawei,Mate Xs,lol at the comments so completely out of touch with reality expecting new technology to cost super cheap wait until this matures and then youll get your cheaper foldable phones except apple will still price their foldable phone at and you guys still wont be happy with cheap prices
Huawei,Mate Xs,nice but crazily overpriced
Huawei,Mate Xs,is it worth to get am thinking if should get it for the price of this you can buy flagship phonetablet and donate remaining money to charity
Huawei,Mate Xs,had mine since the launch in the uk brilliant phone good battery life cameras are above expectations screen is as good as the day first unwrapped the phone
Huawei,Mate Xs,not practical design and plastic screen are exposedwont even last months in pocket
Huawei,Mate Xs,its the very best phone created to ourdays and its very easy to install google more yeah for prototype the screen is very exposed and its plastic wont even last months this design is just for show thats it and its not an everyday phone
Huawei,Mate Xs,out of all foldable phones that came out since till date only that nokia feels qualitywise better well implemented without compromises issues
Huawei,Mate Xs,it aint made for everyone the price is unbelievably high
Huawei,Mate Xs,if cost wasnt factor would buy this in an instant its head shoulders above every other available folding phone
Huawei,Mate Xs,phenomenal premium design smartphone with superior features it has high end cameras and high end processor the battery capacity is very big and it will withstand the intensive use of the device
Huawei,Mate Xs,in years this would cost at best
Huawei,Mate Xs,if it only had ppros camera setup
Huawei,Mate Xs,priced at without any ip rating yet it is in demand and sells exceptionally well it caters to very select group of buyers with discriminating taste anyone who is willing to spend on this smartphone fully understand how to treat such device with care any ip rating is therefore superfluous rare triumph of smartphone design if you ask me
Huawei,Mate Xs,ugh if this had ufs storage and the snapdragon it would so be worth the price kirin chipset is better than sd
Huawei,Mate Xs,it has ufs believe
Huawei,Mate Xs,same question why storage old tecnology dont think that it does have ufs have the mate xs and just ran androbench and measured sequential read speed of mbs and seq write of mbs these are ufs level speeds
Huawei,Mate Xs,is eur in price is euro
Huawei,Mate Xs,new model due out later in please read the arena report and dont make fool of your more ever stop to think that maybe just maybe didnt even know gsmarena article about that existed and that maybe just maybe for that reason would have no reason to think another model was coming later in and that doesnt matter when this is what they have released on the market try thinking little harder next time and dont make fool of your self again honestly calling someone else fool when you dont even know how to not put space between the your and self in yourself and when you dont know how to put periods at the end of your sentences how hypocritical
Huawei,Mate Xs,youd think for that price theyd care enough to update the internals more like with at least more new model due out later in please read the arena report and dont make fool of your self again
Huawei,Mate Xs,this devices would be more benefit if it has systems
Huawei,Mate Xs,why only ufs storage same question why storage old tecnology
Huawei,Mate Xs,all you people talking about huawei and yet no one bats an eye when your precious beloved more lol
Huawei,Mate Xs,is it tablet
Huawei,Mate Xs,well google stopped working with them because they are accused of espionage hope you like more all you people talking about huawei and yet no one bats an eye when your precious beloved american companies that can do no wrong do the exact same thing and even worse youre all hypocrites and trump is just butthurt that china has better technology
Huawei,Mate Xs,samsung galaxy fold and flip are just gemmick devices they are not worth the price this ma more agreed
Huawei,Mate Xs,no mm headphone jack and loudspeaker onlyhmmmps not to mention it selling for au more well thats lie because its not even released yet
Huawei,Mate Xs,ngl the camera is such an overkill for the screen size like who would spend on th more are there any laptops you can fit in your jeans pockets
Huawei,Mate Xs,what the different with the huawei mate no kirin the main differences are stronger screen new processor an improved hinge design and the addition of end caps on the hinge mechanism any other difference is minuscule
Huawei,Mate Xs,well done huawei will support them google ss
Huawei,Mate Xs,mate xs is lacking the apps you want and easily fragile lol
Huawei,Mate Xs,good they move away from google like that lot well google stopped working with them because they are accused of espionage hope you like that about them
Huawei,Mate Xs,its already forgettable and it isnt even out yet not to mention its departure from google more good they move away from google like that lot
Huawei,Mate Xs,would rather buy surface book for this money yh same here
Huawei,Mate Xs,at this price no ois for any camera really far fa too expesive
Huawei,Mate Xs,some decent upgrades in exchange for slightly higher price than the last model wish they couldve at least squeezed in an additional mah out of the battery methinks with the price bump well be seeing second huawei foldable model soon
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,download microg service first of all and then download arora store so you can access majority more exactly the lack of google support is nonissue the xt shipps with easy travel android container out of the box and apps like youtube music and maps work better than on samsung for additional convenience install microg and you are good to go
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,the reviewers complaint is akin to someone complaining that special car isnt righthand drive the mate xt sold like hotcakes in china
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,oh look another anon making no sense have said repeatedly this is an impressive tech demo more first samsung fold or the first huawei trifold both at the same price of course it would be the huawei people used to buy the first iterations of hyperphones from erriccsons to nokia to iphones to samsung fold in droves despite all being half baked ideas but this huawei is much more special because they started this years ago some people dont appreciate just how far and how difficult it is to develop foldable phone let alone one that folds three screens
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,without google play store it not worth in india bought from china but facing very problem more you bought phone knowing it would have half baked google app implementation why are you even complaining
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,lets be real this is such technological marvel and sight to behold testing it feels just so unreal
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,no way the tri fold luxury user only phone is fragile when you test it against sledgehammers no house keys and such can literally damage whole portion of the device rendering it absolute pain to use and repair just watch jerryrigeverything
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,huawei keep pushing design to prevent stagnation also stop calling this device trifold more it is the correct word google for bifold doors and wallets
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,well at least this doesnt have the huge black bars seen in every single book style foldable it does have an aspect ratio that actually resembles tablet when fully unfolded im really looking forward to this type of foldable in the future because currently the price is kinda nuts
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,years ahead of apple
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,saw this good watch httpsyoutubeqgnshywsidufdefhqmtqhs
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,its not ruined here in russia no one cares about google play anymore any local business apps are in huawei appgallery rustore xiaomi getapps etc etc so as in china no one using google play
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,great phone bricked by us sanctions
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,buy simple android it works this dont security on kindergarten
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,bifold wallet folds once trifold has always meant folding to have sections not folding more no one cares bro
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,there are ton of videos on youtube showing people cracking the phone even before paying the money for it this design is just not durable in the slightest
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,true this folds twice not sure why theyre calling it trifold maybe better to cal more bifold wallet folds once trifold has always meant folding to have sections not folding times
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,but but but it foldstwicebecause they keep adding hinges and that this rate more true this folds twice not sure why theyre calling it trifold maybe better to call it triscreen nope dualfold sounds much better as to what this is solving it is putting tablet into pocket that is ambitious and should be commended the first samsung fold was horrible and so are the rest of them the samsung flip and other models are okay they are turning phablet into mini phone which has some appeal however phablet turning into tablet has not been successful yet and believe the solution was with the first foldable phone the huawei mate you need to start off with the maximum pocket size first then build around that restriction the best way to do that is with an outer fold this makes the radius larger so you eliminate crease on the screen it also allows you to use the phone while closed up and doesnt require putting in an extra camera or an extra screen talking about the camera you only have space for three but theyll be the best selfie and rear around but no external lens attachment thats hump on one edge of the tablet you can have second the second hump could hold headphone jack and an pen silo you can also dust and waterproof the device the way samsung did in sectors the only negative aspect is that we dont have the technology for this yet as the outer tablet screen needs to be smooth glass but not fragile and strong enough to handle regular wear until that happens think fold phones will be severely compromised experience to the point where you are better served having two dedicated devices instead so yah thats that this latest huawei fold is not there because it is too heavy and too thick to be properly pocketable let alone other obstacles like the camera quality battery life software limitations chipset performance or the price just get proper flagship and get proper tablet do not get this huawei fold device as its clearly in experimental state
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,youve said this device is just an extra hinge and screen for then bashed it on mul more what fingers did point all have done here is stuck to my opinion youll have to go back and point out exactly where have demanded others to agree youll wont be able to so stop wasting time with stupid comments have my opinion on this device and aint changing it to appease you so agree or dont really do not give flying
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,no you said that arm macs have ram embedded within cpu huh apple silicon soc is literally just everything combined cpu gpu etc was thinking of how intel packaged their lunar lake cpus cpu contains soc instead when talked about the ram being separated in the soc sorry
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,yes literally said that the ram is separate from the soc no you said that arm macs have ram embedded within cpu
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,who would win speed test the huawei mate xt ultimate or the samsung galaxy more to be fair though you buy foldable not just this one for being able to swap between screen sizes instantly and for the cool factor not for power
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,they arent the memory embeded in the cpu is called cpu cache if the ram were there only the more yes literally said that the ram is separate from the soc
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,deleted post careful ive learned first hand saying anything that isnt instantly perceived as total devotion to huawei and its products round these parts can open right can of worms
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,soc cpu theyre nearly the same thing anyway the ram on those apple silicon chips are more they arent the memory embeded in the cpu is called cpu cache if the ram were there only the cpu would be able to use the ram which is why its off to the side as seperate chips
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,ram isnt embedded within the cpu its right next to the soc have you seen teardown soc cpu theyre nearly the same thing anyway the ram on those apple silicon chips are integrated into the chips themselves and apple put that ram right next to the core part of those chips aka the soc
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,its laptop worth at best apple loves making out they have these super computer more destroy it in what if its gaming you dont buy mac for gaming anyway theres reason why professionals still buy macs to use for rendering modelling and so on those usd macbooks are mostly made for those people who earns lot of money and use their computers as way to earn that much money anyway and you forget that adobe stuff are really optimized to work well with apple silicon too and yes the huawei phone is expensive for good reason also yes apple is bloody greedy that doesnt mean all of their stuff is suddenly awful though
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,look at all these people getting upset over someone insulting checks notes phone look if you are invested in this company the you do you
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,shame about the chipset is really holding it back
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,needs stylus such waste of that big unfolded screen if you cannot draw on it using sketchbook pro etc also needs sharpd cad then it can replace my ipad mini th gen
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,youre just backwards sorry you constantly contradict yourself every time you comment more oh look another anon making no sense have said repeatedly this is an impressive tech demo but poor value consumer product im sorry that has gone over your head but that aint my problem
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,and that extra strong thin outer folding hinge that no other company can replicate is glorious more have seen evidence that suggests the contrary but sure dude whatever you say
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,wtf are you waffling on about what false information this is literally just foldable wi more and that extra strong thin outer folding hinge that no other company can replicate is glorious something you are failing to understand
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,phone that will kill tabs and laps after it is matured technically and price is affordable com more tablets maybe dont see how its competition to laptops though
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,so you have no idea why they have not made any foldables like this the lack of engineering talent in apple and samsung is the reason they cant make anything close to this
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,nah apple does not do gimmicks that are are half finished will wait for proper apple foldable all apple have introduced so far in their new phones have been gimmicks including dynamic island magsafe apple intelligence and camera button
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,erm if you read it it says triple screen on huawei site dude literally just copied and pasted that line from their site take look for yourself httpsconsumerhuaweicomenphonesmatextultimatedesign
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,also youve been throwing petty insults but oh no youve not at all dont be more to who you chimed in with your ignorance is bliss comment dont pass your bad attitude off on me pal
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,omg its not trifold it folds twice sick of hearing trifold huawei hasnt once more you do not set the language rules just help yourself and search trifold flyer to see that you are wrong
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,dont need to understand the science of the engineering to express an opinion of the practic more youve said this device is just an extra hinge and screen for then bashed it on multiple comments just because then usually people use facts to form logical opinion but hey ho basically you dont like it that people dont like your opinion and when someone challenges it you get annoyed unfortunately and then do what youre trying to say others are doing so boy who cried wolf if you bash device off false information or ideas then based off nothing people will challenge it dont just then point fingers and act like you didnt say what you said lol its all in the comments
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,about your apple point eh not every single apple product is that bad even those more its laptop worth at best apple loves making out they have these super computer chips when top end desktop will destroy it for half the price probably cheaper to manufacture because of inhouse parts so they are massively inflating their products it should be cheaper not more expensive its more expensive using rd party parts you cant pick and choose what ok to be expensive and what isnt based off company reputation this device is expensive for reason and probably isnt that great as st gen product and overly priced because its new type of product again this has happened since the car was invented and the horse and cart was the main choice of transport apple are greedy and overcharge on every product they sell you like the now plastic phone cases from leather but costs the same or removing products from the box but constantly increasing the prices or the iphone thats at best phone and costs about the same as mid range android device to produce
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,erwell except for them stating it to be super slim trifold design right on their own pro more erm if you read it it says triple screen on huawei site
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,samsung has never released buck phone with permanently exposed display going around more samsungs st foldable was about for far worst device and less screens and you could literally peel the screen off and destroy your own phone current galaxy fold special edition so not new design or tech is between pretty sure its just the fold or how about gold plated su for samsung sells retro design its not version of flip phone lol galaxy su with max ram storage is at least thats just to name few overly expensive devices for no reason also influencers get iphones and galaxy phones so what nonsense is that samsung gave olympic athletes free olympic edition phones painted different colour so if you want an influencer company samsung is the one will panda to anyone to gain market dominance been average devices since the notes
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,there isnt another trifold this is the first you accept it because it is pioneer pr more omg its not trifold it folds twice sick of hearing trifold huawei hasnt once referred to it as
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,lol you put that comment then end it with hypocrisy your own comment is exactly what that is more dont need to understand the science of the engineering to express an opinion of the practicality of the product get over yourself will you and havent argued against the existence of this device as demonstration of technical capability its as consumer product dont see the value sorry that seems to upset you enough to start throwing petty insults grow up bit perhaps
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,when no one knows why apple or samsung didnt do it first only you dont more so you have no idea why they have not made any foldables like this
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,the question is the point on having such phone if someone is willing to pay then he should consult physiatrist for good
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,version should have better peformance bigger battery like mah better connectivity bt wifi faster charging like titanium frame maybe and then the foldable tablet can become the best phone in the world
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,cheers from malaysia
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,its st gen product stop going on happened with samsung and their st foldable the more samsung has never released buck phone with permanently exposed display going around the frame this phone is not for use its influencer trash and am not surprised to see it being reviews at this place
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,there seems to be an idea here by obsessives that huawei are the only ones that could have mad more when no one knows why apple or samsung didnt do it first only you dont realise that innovation is dead at apple and samsung and the only way they can sell anything is by smearing their competitors products and banning the competition in their protected markets
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,so all apple devices then people forget to buy stand for an imax pro or whatever it is was more about your apple point eh not every single apple product is that bad even those macbook pros bring you quite comparable performance to desktops with the best processors and graphics cards out there and while on battery even at least for professional workloads like what people who make animated films in pixar or disney do and while really hate to admit it usd for more ram on those macbooks is understandable since the ram is embedded within the cpu making ram upgrades more expensive still annoying though id rather buy windows laptop with upgradable ram but those macbooks have really great onbattery performance and battery life just like phone
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,those examples all represented clear improvements of the tech standards they succeeded tel more lol you put that comment then end it with hypocrisy your own comment is exactly what that is again all new tech and no its not just adding an extra screen and hinge absolute ignorance ive not seen for while tbh has this issue again the st foldables were breaking because people were peeling film off that was actually the screen isnt an issue now is it if you dont try and design new things then you wont ever see advances in the productindustry do you think they just glue an extra screen go we just need more hinge here rub their hands together and go all done nope you need some of the smartest engineers working months or years to figure out how to make this work and actually be useable product which from now we will see more companies put more money in to this tech and yes its tech its redesigning screens being able to fold and hold pressures tens if not hundreds of thousands of times without failure actual rnd to redesign these things how the internals work in such constraints able to meet worldwide regulations so you can have good enough battery but not have issues with air pressures like on planes as just few difficulties theyll come across even just having an extra screen with extra failure points like hinges glass and heat and again the screens able to handle the pressures and bends dont think you quite understand engineering or the sciences needed to make this happen like the st foldables and all screen flip phones
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,and its apparently mediocre at all three plus it costs more than the decent examples of all more you cant compare the price for tablet and phone that fits in your pocket with regular phone and tablet all consumer products are not for everyone its done the problem solving too what would you ever do to need square screen on foldable cant find any proper use except for reading books but this you know
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,cannot but then adding extra hinges just to achieve said result wouldnt be my suggest more its st gen product stop going on happened with samsung and their st foldable the st full screen flip phones had multiple limitations while paying more for less performance all were awful devices that had literal hardware and software issues non stop look where foldables and flip are now not the same for had with socs the and that were the st android socs that were bit and think went to decaocta core had terrible issues but again happens with tech thats got new changes also forget when google went to there ownsamsung made soc etc and how the pixel series were for beta testers basically same with bluetooth headphones and other peripherals like mice keyboards etc st gen of the products usually suck and after advancements with that new tech over years they become cheaper and better and other companies then invest in it really really simple to understand matey
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,were going to have to agree to disagree on that you seem quite taken with it feel it more so all apple devices then people forget to buy stand for an imax pro or whatever it is was or how about new macbook pros that are how about paying for an extra gb of ram this has happened throughout history with tech had tv that cost ssds used to be for gb years ago now its what when we went from crt tvs to lcd it was expensive when we went to tvs it was expensive its what happens with new tech able to mass build device with new tech bet they barely making profit as well with the amount of rnd that went it to this device ignorance is bliss guess
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,eh evs and phones are pretty much two different things dude and samsung couldve don more there seems to be an idea here by obsessives that huawei are the only ones that could have made tri fold phone when no one knows why apple or samsung didnt do it first it certainly wasnt because they couldnt feel this is part pr stunt as well to get attention for brand that has fallen other chinese brands make superior foldables
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,got the huawei mate xt bought from shopee malaysia maxis sim card can read no problem since maxis using huawei communication technology
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,apple could make foldable if it wanted to like it could make an ev if it wanted to good jok more eh evs and phones are pretty much two different things dude and samsung couldve done it earlier seeing as they were one of the brands that kickstarted the foldable trend if not the literal only one but they instead would like to miss opportunities just for money and ai and the south korean government that too if it werent for the chaebols samsung wouldve continued to make phones that feel fresh and good to use
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,will you stop with this childish fanboy rubbish people can like whatever they want to like if more yes people can be fans of brand whatever that doesnt mean you can just say huawei is the only brand which can make trifold phones that is fanboy cope
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,im curious if emui os could be installed on cn device if thats the case there could be huge savings right off the top this is mostly fantasy for me as my assumption was confirmed by huawei sales support that canada is not covered under warranty which seems pretty crummy dont understand why pdaplaza still lists global version as presale and chinese version is weeks for shipment unless they procure to order
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,imagine what theyd do with an elite tho kirin chipsets were on par more that is completely true but it doesnt change the fact that they dont have such efficiency right now youre making an entirely different point to my argument theres no relevance
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,the mali gpu wasnt that much slower than adreno and now its actually faster wasnt that much slower lmao
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,um what this sounds like massive fanboy cope infinix just released concept phone that more will you stop with this childish fanboy rubbish people can like whatever they want to like if someone is fan of brand who cares so what
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,yeah but what meant is the immensely more efficient process of the newer chipsets it doesn more the mali gpu wasnt that much slower than adreno and now its actually faster
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,actually can for two reasons first in my opinion true engineering marvels are tho more um what this sounds like massive fanboy cope infinix just released concept phone that trifolds vertically and why should apple try to make foldable when foldables still have so many faults they do not really deserve the iphone brand besides who needs trifold phone even normal foldables aside from the ones that folds like flip phones of yore are quite hard to justify purchasing and samsung literally could pull off the same trifold thing with more refinement they literally kickstarted foldable phones after all but their chaebols just like to stick their heads in the sand for more money and control over the south korean government plus have you seen the durability tests jerryrigeverything has done on the huawei phone the phone is just incredibly fragile
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,can you suggest way of unfolding into larger display with less hinges cannot but then adding extra hinges just to achieve said result wouldnt be my suggestion to begin with first id be asking what actual value there is to larger form factor foldables beyond the current market standards second how might that be achieved without just adding more second hinges and thus exasperating the compromises already present in the foldable category see you dont seem to get it just adding in extra hinges before solving for those compromises isnt marvel level engineering show me trifold that has better quality tougher display equal or increased battery life and no creases all at cost that isnt double the current market standard then well talk even if ill still not be personally sure of the exact use case would at least consider that marvel engineering
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,ah then you are in the camp of more hinges automatically equals better yes after all ext more can you suggest way of unfolding into larger display with less hinges
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,what extra form factor yes the larger tablet and not the compromisedqu more ah then you are in the camp of more hinges automatically equals better yes after all extra hinges will mean and even bigger and therefore less compromised tablet sizes
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,would you really pay cars worth of money for tablet with mid range phones performance
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,you cant ignore or downplay that its an engineering marvel that only huawei more actually can for two reasons first in my opinion true engineering marvels are those that deliver significant advancements with minimal tradeoffsthis device represents the opposite second see no reason to suggest that only huawei is capable of producing such product rather they are simply the first company to choose to the advancement is the extra form factor it can unfold into do you see any other phone manufacturer with similar product samsung cant make foldable with similar thinness and apple cant make foldable at all you simply cant accept that huawei is the only phone maker with the capability of producing such product
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,you cant ignore or downplay that it is an engineering marvel that only huawei is capable more you cant ignore or downplay that its an engineering marvel that only huawei is capable of producing actually can for two reasons first in my opinion true engineering marvels are those that deliver significant advancements with minimal tradeoffsthis device represents the opposite second see no reason to suggest that only huawei is capable of producing such product rather they are simply the first company to choose to agree its adopters will be those willing to pay the premium though in fact that would seem rather obvious
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,no they were not made up by me they are my interpretations of the findings of the more youre completely justified in questioning this product but some people are just desperate to see this company succeed as an underdog which is laughable because the top chinese smartphone manufacturers are anything but with the government subsidies they get
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,you were claiming that it was bad in peforming as tablet foldable or slab phone which wasn more no they were not made up by me they are my interpretations of the findings of the review nothing to suggest it has durability problems dude this represents nothing but considerable compromises to durability go watch jerryrigeverythings video on it it did not show device capable of standing up every day use in the real world for any reasonable length of time certainly not enough to justify investment and would be vary wary of warranty limitations in such anexperimental product look bottom line is hope anyone who actually busy one of these enjoys it its hard pass from me though not just based on the aforementioned limitations compromises and cost but also keep drawing blank on why another hinge is in anyway actually useful
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,by spreading nonsense assume you mean offering an opinion that differs from yours it has more you were claiming that it was bad in peforming as tablet foldable or slab phone which wasnt the case at all and was made up by you all reviewers have praised the performance in the different modes and the seemless switching between the theres nothing to suggest it has durability problems even then it has warranty and free display replacement the performance is adequate even in tablet mode battery life is understandable when driving such large display
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,everyone will agree that the mate xt represents poor value as consumer product thats more guess just dont understand the need for an extra hinge at any price dont see what need is being catered for if having it fold twice is better than once then wont folding three times be better than two four better than three and so on its interesting from an engineering stand point sure but even at half the price or less just do not see what is being accomplished by going down this route how many times do people want their smartphones to fold
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,and its apparently mediocre at all three thats not the case at all all more by spreading nonsense assume you mean offering an opinion that differs from yours it has poor battery life multiple screen creases and durability that likely mean this will have limited life span at best its compromised smartphone and tablet and more expensive than both
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,fair then let me reformulate you wouldnt spend on this regardless that you have more dont care whether anyone buys one of these or not im offering my opinion that as consumer product it represents poor value that ok with you
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,mate you have no idea regarding my financial means so knock of the silly insinuations obv more fair then let me reformulate you wouldnt spend on this regardless that you have the money or not and if it is bad choice or not why do you care is that going to affect you in any way no if huawei thinks that it was worth releasing then it was theyre not going to make significant financial gains at least outside of europe but they sure will get attention which is what they are after
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,and what exactly is the problem if it is being sold certainly you dont have the money more mate you have no idea regarding my financial means so knock of the silly insinuations obviously its huaweis choice to sell this if they want to im not suggesting they be prevented from doing so im saying it is bad choice
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,what is actually being accomplished here what problem is being solved it more and its apparently mediocre at all three plus it costs more than the decent examples of all three combined and with the obvious durability compromises wont last as long again as tech demo this has some merit as consumer product though practically none
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,then it should remain tech demo only something that gets shown off at expos and such more and what exactly is the problem if it is being sold certainly you dont have the money to buy it but theres people who do and simply just want to show off and also this is firstof and the first product in something like this is always going to have downsides thats why you never buy the firstgen product and wait for the second gen still many people will ignore that and still buy it which is the only justification for huawei releasing this for anyone to buy
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,shame on them for what exactly remember samsung pretty much pioneered this category and le more what is actually being accomplished here what problem is being solved its proper tablet form factor when fully unfolded it can also be used as foldable and slab phone its devices in its unique and the st of its kind
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,its not trying to solve any problem its purely just to show that its possib more then it should remain tech demo only something that gets shown off at expos and such in order to get attention and not consumer product
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,this is impressive piece of technology no doubt about it especially when you consider what more shame on them for what exactly remember samsung pretty much pioneered this category and let be honest what is actually being accomplished here what problem is being solved cause whilst this may be coolish tech demo as consumer product all im seeing is ton of unnecessary compromises for practically zero benefit at massively increased price
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,yearold processing performance is at the end of its lifecycle so not futureproof besides this is huge display to watch contents in sd resolution not impressive at all battery life is terrible considering the huge capacity on paper gms workarounds are not premium experience smartphones are made to make life easier not more difficult jerryrigeverything proved that one edge of the display is exposed to severe damage when folded and easily end up with dead pixels nice prototype but not proper product
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,not only that but keep in mind that this device mustve been in researchproduction for more imagine what theyd do with an elite tho kirin chipsets were on par with snapdragon until they were denied access to tsmc
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,elite samsung display would be the dream for trifold device material panel wouldnt be bad either with how they cooked with cm material panel
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,not surprised with the hm battery rating since the battery needs to deal with practically more not only that but keep in mind that this device mustve been in researchproduction for little while so the display must be using year old tech not to mention the fact that the display is massive for such relatively small battery samsungs tab is inches and has mah battery finally the kirin chipset is also little icky lol imagine what theyd do with an elite tho
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,over engineering device but it will lay the foundation for future devicesmakers should start works to bring down the price of every foldable to below
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,expensive toys for the super rich lol but yeah would love to buy one if has the extra money
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,that profile shot of the display makes it look like an allplastic display the way it is warping everywhere if look at my flip in that angle the bits away from the crease are very uniform if it is allplastic have serious doubt that this phone has any longevity at all without the glass to keep it in place itll stretch and deform from basic use
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,this is basically every huawei phone review meh performance meh software but everything else is excellent
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,tensor has its fine share of issues but overall it depends in what it is good or not google has their focus on few things but overall tensor is less versatile than exynos but oh boy didnt expect kirin to sink even lower explains the abysmal battery life when unfolded it would be bad anyhow but with more efficient chip it wouldnt be that bad durability of folding phones is thing have issues with but at least the more classic ones like galaxy fold or vivo one are more protected when folded and have regular outer screen the design here makes both impossible that combined with the makes makes this phone for niche of niche of niche wonder if this concept will ever be popular time will tell when other companies try it too
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,id say the mediocre display brightness is also con the whole reason for buying this is the novelty not sure what benefits from trifold aspect ratio when its unfolded but this is showpiece not particularly amazing in any one aspect except for photo quality
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,this is not fold it is fold design as everybody can see who has eye in his head really do not understand why they call it fold because it is not
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,big cool modern but folding fragile and too expensive ill be happy to go low profile for more it will be expensive and fragile what did you expect from tri folding that it is slim
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,hzno google servicesnm outdated architectureplus euro huawei are sm more now its just euro on jingdong
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,tried the phone in thailand incredibly thin and beautiful but the two creases are very visible and part of the screen is not protected when closed and easy to get scratched price euros you must be crazy to spend so much on phone so fragilefold is better choice
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,vivo fe has mah battery for inch display whereas huawei mate xt ultimate has more none of your devices listed include screen on pocketable mobile phone
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,all the specs is great except the bc cpu this device is the thinnest phone in the world when unfolded they dont make cpu to fit that and keep cooled
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,they dont sell it in my country ofc but gsmarena says the mate is while its little im my country its about
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,are sure about this price great budget my man budget gaming laptops since budget technically doesnt mean the same thing when used as term for products and essentially just means cheap and low end are usually usd for the worst of the worst usd for something decent that can at least run gta enhanced without starting fire and for laptop that can actually give you good experience
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,next step phone folding ten times and calling it the accordion
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,never buy folded phones ive been using for years and replaced each year under warran more still stick to standard phones as the durability on my huawei pultra is breath taking and ill only consider tri fold somewhere in when it can withstand metre drop like honor and have at least an ip ip ip ipk like the honor an at least optical digital zoom like huawei pro but this device is still awe some kind of tempts me
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,wo wo wo dame so expensive
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,euros just to make your phone fold twice they dont sell it in my country ofc but gsmarena says the mate is while its little
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,chipset kirin not snapdragon snapdragon is better you forgot about the sanctions
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,said budget gaming laptop not high end one are you sane are sure about this price great budget my man
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,euro for that fold phone is not posible
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,id have to ask what kind of high end laptop you have because even budget gaming laptop more the phone is euro not lol
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,not esim capable
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,speed hows the product sooooo goooood
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,best product speed hows the product
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,cell phones are constantly evolving so to speak the huawei mate xt ultimate is breakthroug more you realise huawei use their own resources for company that makes their own chipset and software this us impressive the thing is usa banned them from snapdragon and gms so they really are trying their best to resolve those issues
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,best product
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,overpriced ngl
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,show speed purchase of this right crazy rich
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,huawei flagship phone but the saddest thing is thsat it doesnt have google whats the problem with downloading google services takes minute to do
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,my flagship phone high end laptop and midrange tablet all cost less than this phone and are more id have to ask what kind of high end laptop you have because even budget gaming laptop nowadays is easily dollars
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,instead of carrying phone tablet and laptop you have all in one devices which can fit more my flagship phone high end laptop and midrange tablet all cost less than this phone and are so much safer considering they arent that fragile
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,who does even need tripple folding phone instead of carrying phone tablet and laptop you have all in one devices which can fit in your pocket its safer abd cheaper
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,then buy other tri folds where is the problem oh wait there is none who does even need tripple folding phone
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,that phone is great but too overpriced like for could buy four awesome flagships then buy other tri folds where is the problem oh wait there is none
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,what was huawei thinking making this nobody needs triple folding phoneits so impract more well havent think what need triple fold for but for google they dont need it inside china and in malaysia we slowly adopting huawei eco system by changing lots of device from apple xiaomi to huawei yes first is very not use to but im slowly enjoy the benefits from huawei which makes my life better example of the smart ai xiaoyi china version of celia ah yes im using china version instead of malaysia or overseas version of huawei devices can say its like when steve job launching touch screen phone while other still laughing at him being ridiculous for future phone using non button input but the times flies and told by history we dont need to give any comment about company creativity and inventions but to enjoy first so we can make ours visions farther and wider
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,buy yourself laptop for euro ridicules price or buy another trifold oh wait there is none
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,great phone purchase global version am surprised as thought have to go through many apps to get google work but trust me every single google app is working with notification and syn greatest tech producthappy with my purchase
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,really good for you did like you already ordered one and im existed its an amazing phone purchase one the gb an tb of storage an it works very well for me am using it using the tmobile network an get speeds on the chinese varient since the global varient is set to be only agree the specs are not up to par with the price like the fact that know that have all types of forms of smartphonefoldtablet
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,know guys the processor is not acceptable for that price of the device but come on huawe more really good for you did like you already ordered one and im existed
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,is euro for gb no for the first trifold

Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,euro nm maybe us will make peace with china also
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,euro
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,euros for chinese phone think huawei with his trifolds becomes vertu where
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,euro for nm chip hahaha nice joke thats what happens when there is no competition
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,yeah wtf is this youre not paying for the performance here smartass youre paying for the formfactor and its so expensive because its first gen product
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,marco sep nm is enough for anything today nm from apple is overkill just to scroll twitter but copy more got nm headache trying to read your comment neeed grammar punc tu ation overkillpowering down great you killed data
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,thought there was optical where the heck did you get that info
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,please update price now every year
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,bifold it only folds in areas yes absolutly
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,while this device was without doubt innovative in rather stagnant market they prioritized form over function on this one zfolding was recipe for disaster the moment that they made the soft plastic screen to fold outwards and not only being the main screen when folded but also leaving fragile edge exposed hopefully the company and its competitors learn about that design flaw and choose windows folding design for future doublefolding devices
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,innovations
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,hope you make stronger processors than this
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,yeah awesomely expensive too the tech is cool price not really ill have to agree on that one with you
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,tell me price insane price of in my country
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,deleted post tell me price
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,deleted post yes want to buy it
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,hi still have the mate xt
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,super cool gadget with an amazing capabilities its incredibly thin despite being more bifold it only folds in areas
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,now samsung bosses are calling trump and saying help extend their ban from google apps or we more eu countries japan taiwan vietnam costa rica australia all banned phased out huawei if you think it has anything to do with samsung you are misguided reading is free friend
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,im highly skeptical about that fully working phone without any major issues being calle more well this didnt age well now isnt it apparently it is prototype not thought one either mean to expose screen that sensitive to pocket elements must have been designed by years old only that would explain the why this thing even came out for sale well letting that asside this was made to be tested on people to see how fast they get angry some opened it once and ta da screen kaput they probably were the angry elite category
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,samsung slim and iphone air cant be as slim as this phone unfolded because mm is yet unmatched to date
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,they need to fix the crease on regular foldables before they make trifoldables
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,what an innovation just keep going huawei samsung glazers from their ipad want to know your location for not saying that fakeass rolling samsung phoneisnt innovative
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,httpswwwyourdictionarycomdailydriver use more common sense next time commenting non sense httpsdictionarycambridgeorgdictionaryenglishcommonsense
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,actually hes one of the few that makes sense in here im highly skeptical about that fully working phone without any major issues being called prototype its loudly screaming dont understand technology this phone is innovative whats missing in todays industry
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,doubt you understand what are you saying lol actually hes one of the few that makes sense in here
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,just figured it out what this thing is good for to laugh at it and its hours users cause after hours the screen is dead well on most of them huahweis ultimate ewaste waiting to happen
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,trifoldables are the foldables of the future hoping theyll keep making it better
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,moment of silence for the case makers out there
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,samsung iphone google pixel brands are jealousing with huawei brand huawei is father of all brands huawei is still big brand
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,terrible joke mate he did actually pretty good sarcastic joke but this kind of humor not for everybody so get you
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,watch this and help yourself httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhvkpnmjrcm yep random video from random uploader is huge credible source to trust something about major technology
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,its literally the thickness of mm jack the phone is mm think the joke went over your head
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,very simply all iphone samsung pixel fans jealously visit this site and write bad comment more thanks god im all brands hater but praise this device
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,bro iphone pro max is mm and does not have headphone jack talk about them
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,no radio no jack wat da its literally the thickness of mm jack the phone is mm
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,prototype phone good for flexing bad for daily driving battery availability is limited more doubt you understand what are you saying lol
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,then find your way buy it already in the market dude how dumb expecting other company to pro more think that joke went over your head sweetie
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,totally impractical those are the trade offs for foldables and flip phones at the moment probably will take few years before well see ones that are really thin
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,totally impractical
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,too thin battery not big enough once again the marketing department decided that what everyo more too thin its tri fold phone man it wouldnt work out if it was thick lmao
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,this is hilarious about huawei matepad xt ultimate most reviews are raving about it and this more yea im taiwanese and what you are saying about me is true and so what
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,marco oct you missed the point here the term overkill is not maximizing the processor not about how more technology will keep advancing and evolving and it wont stop flagship phones will always get the best spec they can give and in manufacturing and marketing aspect they have to keep giving the new things whether chip is enough or overpower is depends on how we utilize it high performance pc is for professionals or people who need it eg video editing rendering designer or even gamers and streamers etc same as high end phones chip just that consumers get it to watch youtube and basic stuff powerful chip in this case can only helps to enhance battery life and reduce heats with high display setting which cant even show their real potential there are moderate phone in the market for web browsing and music instead of getting flagship an older iphone is good enough for that as well
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,this trifold phone now is big laughing stock in china you guys over here totally been cov more this is hilarious about huawei matepad xt ultimate most reviews are raving about it and this bluedragoneye guy just threw out one single youtubers video as proof the phone is bad just go check out serpentzas channel page it wont take you seconds to realise this guy is antichina come on do better pls this is too easy to rebuke that its silly
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,yeah the recording will be better but how will you notice the difference on inch more with zoom zooming the main camera to the same size to or on two different phones at the same time allows you to see the difference also there are players that let you scale recorded video up to even if it is so you see only small portion of the frame but you can see if it is good
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,will be great when there will be big for smartphone mp sensors without pixe more yeah the recording will be better but how will you notice the difference on inch or display
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,would be nice but its not thing you can do with more than fps right now on basic more will be great when there will be big for smartphone mp sensors without pixel binning or mp with binning to resulted to the same and not small sensors binned to mp despite pixel count all we have for now is upscaled and aisharpened or sometimes even not sharpened in case of realme old motorola and xiaomi phones with mp mp sensor in lot of light can produce actually better but not in all ways hdr is worse lens distortions is heavier with more details than modern mp mp and mp mp sensors
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,this can be great for music and movies folded music unfolded movies
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,expensive with ghz cpu frequency doesnt matter in phones since most of the games youre gonna play aside from emulation of course are gpu intensive the kirin and series did great job running genshin impact on the highest graphics without any serious issues
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,samsung galaxy fold is better than huawei mate xt ultimate no one is replying me thats weird statement youre comparing phone that folds into what is essentially mini tablet and has gone through generations of evolving to first gen tri fold phone not fair comparison but yeah you are kinda right the fold is kind of better phone as long as you dont care about your phone being trifolding insane thinga majig
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,thats insane that this processor had cores but for the next gen expected kirin to be abl more would be nice but its not thing you can do with more than fps right now on basically even the best phones plus it just takes up too much storage and not lot of people have devices they can use it for especially considering their phones having displays at best
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,the process is about how efficient the cores run less energyheat used and how many transist more you missed the point here the term overkill is not maximizing the processor not about how efficient it is in computers you dont need core rtx with gb of memory just to watch youtube same thing goes to mobile and yes there will be cons in it its not smart to buy huawei phones now because theyre still in the beta phase from sanctions but some just dont care like buying ip
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,rather than hoping all chinese manufacturers create their own os want them to unite and cre more the harmony next os no aosp will release next month
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,nm chip for expensive flagship in oh dear thats the power of more nm is enough for anything today nm from apple is overkill just to scroll twitter but copy paste phone from apple and samsung since the year huawei got banned
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,welldeserved yeah keep telling yourself that pal if you think huawei deserved the sanctio more huawei is different from them its own by the chinese government
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,but isnt getting spied on by both google and huawei even worse you will anyways be spied on regardless of the phone brand dude oppo xiaomi realme vivo samsung iphone huawei doesnt matter they all spy and usesteal yourour data
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,the price very expensive to me eur usd but think this price is reasonable than iphone pro max price with only small upgrade lets all pray for huawei to lower the price bit or release cheaper edition
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,hz screen on phone starting to look like apples vanilla iphones
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,quite thick yet incredibly thin this is remarkable good job how can tell other ppl bring tablet it is in your pocket now samsung is your turn now
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,still better name than oneplus nord ce lite oh meant his username lmao and yours is goofy too haha anyways agree the nord ce lite naming scheme sucks and imo should be illegal
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,at least the charger wont be of what this phone is worth to buy the phone like this huawei more huawei the first one to announce nm processor its not about charger price its about them removing something crucial for environmental goals kirin is not processor
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,all the best will pray for you that you will definitely buy this device soon can buy it anytime as soon as this device is ready to sell but my main worries are can justify that price and even if can justify the price how about the durability have used several huawei phones before so never doubt their quality but plastic screen is plastic screen and this device plastic screen has two creases
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,absolutely hate being spied by googlus if someone want to use it there is gpace want more but isnt getting spied on by both google and huawei even worse
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,lmao goofy ahh name still better name than oneplus nord ce lite
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,no stylus support in huawei mate xt ultimate lmao goofy ahh name
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,google free is major selling point absolutely hate being spied by googlus if someone want to use it there is gpace want smoother experience installing googlus is ez there are ways to install googlus natively
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,well huawei had firstgen foldable back in with the mate xs and that one was just as more the galaxy fold was arguably better example for ewaste but hey you do you chief
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,this phone still has larger battery better cameras and variable aperture on the main cam more well huawei had firstgen foldable back in with the mate xs and that one was just as much as prototype as the first galaxy fold not to mention huawei refused to even release spare parts for it so if youve got mate xs thats still functional today good for you but if not well thats and worthless piece of ewaste down the drain
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,why does it have to have china os how can trust phone an extremely sesitiv more ios or android means its under the patriot act
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,despite the false equivalencies with western countries it is very expensive device and for niche market
Huawei,Mate XT Ultimate,the simple answer is you cant trust any phone these chinaos creators or whatever phones more right
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,thid new nova pro have some battery issue fast charging fast drain dont think fast charging equals fast drainmy oneplus has but battery has been great to me
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,camera is step back nova was noticeably better in low light nova pro is almost same as pro which was also worse than nova nova prop pro are just lightly better than and quite much better than iphone pro mate pro doing also slightly better than yet quite different to nova prop pro still nothing can come close to nova why doing such downgrade
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei using snapdragon usa product
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,usa bond huawei because of apple but will lot if china do the same to usa
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,why does the us have to satisfy your memory are you part of huaweis counsel we more this is all unclassified huawei had silicon level spyware
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,no no google pointless phone outside asia you could thank trump for hammerbanning huawei from using and google services he totally screwed them up because america is scared that huawei will spy them
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,you live under the rock mate creating fantasy in your head they were accused and found gui more as far as remember the us didnt get any information that will prove huaweis security issue think you are the one living under the rock throwing presumptions data which doesnt have proof just like trump being scared of the truth that huawei is way better than iphone before it was banned
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,year old vesion of androiddisgrace so what did new version of android helped you they just change the ui man android version is like updating the skin on your device if you could think that way emui is more convenient than android ui well they used the same code with just tiny bit of changes but to talk about android version is out of the line
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei got cancelled because they were about to surpass all the competition the last phone ma more you live under the rock mate creating fantasy in your head they were accused and found guilty of spying the us programhardware and they have paid for the consequences
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,does not support my bank apps useless if huawei is officially available in your country the appgallery will have apps for most of the major banks thats the case with huawei in malaysia with apps for banks and ecommerce platforms widely available on appgallery these apps are tuned for googleless huawei so issue of compatibility rarely happened how did know me and family used few googleless huawei devices over the years
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,well huawei programming is unorganized unstructured mess more like kids kindergarten
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,flashy looks bluish photos
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the gold accent on the camera housing kinda reminds me of the chanel logo
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,on the contrary the nova pro does fantastic job of rending such complex parts and they look natural even more expensive phones often fail at that like the iphones so we do give huawei credit where its due camera review glad that they noticing on how horrible iphone camera so called big sensor image processing really is
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,back is look like
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,wait the new apis caused sd cards to have really bad speeds yep the android directory on microsd cards has been proxied and very slow for years you cant fix that without rooting last year google made the whole microsd proxied new permission allow management of all files can bypass the proxy but google doesnt allow it in play store google wants phones to have no more than gb because they sell cloud storage theyre playing dirty trick to make microsd cards seem slow the solution is to use nonplay store apps grant the magic permission and select storage directory outside of android then its full speed hundreds of mbsec thousands of iopssec
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,google effectively broke microsd cards about year ago by forcing apps to use new api that more wait the new apis caused sd cards to have really bad speeds
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,you would still be dealing with an outdated android version priced like flagship im more outdated android whats the thing the latest android have bringed to the table and and the most interfaces didnt already have android made by google is just playing catch up with anything everyone is doing implementing features that xiaomi co already had not to forget what mess google is doing everytime they update android the only thinsg that google can be praised is for maps and the photo processing
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the ugliest camera bump design ever seen op is the second
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,depth
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,poor huawei without gms its not goin anywhere
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,had huawei in very high quality for low price but nowdays without google services and no they have zero chance out of china too bad
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,muted vocals is the worst thing possible for phone speakers thats the one thing phone speakers need to get right
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,to gsmarena if screen has over nits and more than hz it is already excellent the other parameters are not important see anyway near for this as offensive as the tag of iphone
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,terrible battery life no sd card audio jack direct to recycle bin
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,very good phonewith awesome camera
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,currently having this device as backup phone it can play games well at most medium settings play genshin most of the time for google services use microg paired with shizuku which allows to install apps that can bypass unknown sources through aurora store as play store replacement
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,hi guys just quick question my nova pro is showing small box like on the screen panel more there is light sensor under screen
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,should swap my samsung for this phone as want to optimise my gaming experience its weaker than for gaming actually
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,been using the device since december love it
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,hi how its battery life better
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,hi the nova pro is this mid range or flagship phone upper midrange
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the got thing about huawei phones right now the price drops im sure that by the end of the year this phone will cost as mutch as the se and that will be good price for it
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,hello everyone for many years was using all kinds of samsung phones recently decided to more where did you buy nova pro not yet in east africa markets yet
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the huawei nova pros ultrawide camera can be macro camera as well
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei and honor are crazy with their prices for long time already even samsung smartphone more but samsung made its own brand of processors camera sensors displays and it doesnt include the fast charger with its own devices nor other accessories
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,speed hspa ltea speed not inside wlan wifi abgna no abgnac is correct
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,no wifi no no google play store expensive
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,euro but no ois no ip no new snapdragon gen very bad huawei youre too funny about this phone sorry for interruption
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,for all brands of mobile phones with respect to battery durability huawei is the best that is more pro in site good
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,like gooooooooold
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,im very disappointed with huawei in my country this phone costs the same as the xiaomi pro and more than the samsung with the same storage configurations exept the xiaomi has gb of ram and the others has have been using huawei phones since and like the brand but theres no way im paying this price for these specs dont care about the chipset as long as it do the basic tasks for me or the megapixels or even the plastic back but no ois at this price if its priced the same as the would definitely pick but at this price would rather save the or get the pro at the same price
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,good phone whit good camers appgallery works good as well most of the apps are already there
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,just want to talk about it processor its to small
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei phones used to be perfect in the past but nowadays they have lost the interest in producing such products no ois no telephoto lens no good periscope lens
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,processor need to upgrade snapdragon
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,totally agree bro huaweis goldglory days are over they showed their potential and tha more its just exactly the opposite man huawei glory day is not over it just being stopped by brute force cos of its too shinny now is the time huawei is accumulating all its potential to break those brute force from another way once being breakthrough huawei will be on its way back to the top that will be the huawei real glory day
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,oneplus nord better similar camera and better battery life etc
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,totally overpriced you can have samsung galaxy as for of the money thats right also as has
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,overpriced for this price there are plenty of options xiaomi pro overpriced but better than huawei honor pro poco fgt moto edge pro realme gt pro samsung xiaomi lite etc
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei ovetpricing their phones like crazy you dont have the best cameras battery cha more ive never bought fone because it had playstore
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,no stfuu its for gaming
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,can it game its not gaming phone in first place but yes it can play
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,can it be charged wireless no
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,wait for whathewer you want and good luck with that google play store kirin processor ghz wifi watts android
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,anyone have this phone yet what version of software do you currently have cerp
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the pro was the last of dying breed
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,lol euro for this are they insane and main camera not ois might aswell just buy pixel
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,pure rubbish totally agree bro huaweis goldglory days are over they showed their potential and that they could easily hve killed apple in very short amount of times basically less than years since the birth of the iphone until huawei ban by trumps admin huawei was tailing both apple and samsung in the charts
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,must admit that the camera configurations on this device is intriguing why the choice of mp ultrawide for the rear camera but whopping mp for the selfie then an mp portrait camera we will see anyways when the full review comes whether it was the right decision
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,why no sd card slot people might need it in order to move apps over from there old phone too more excellent huawei must offer what orthers dont offer
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the only garbage here is your comment people want huawei and they can purchase that stop bei more yes agree with you
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,ok fanboy aside from the design it has little to no value compared to other phones
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,never no need more garbage the only garbage here is your comment people want huawei and they can purchase that stop being like that if you cant even buy it
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,when this arrived at shop never no need more garbage
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,when this phone available at the shops
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,harmonyos and android google
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,dont kid yourself even samsung xiaomi etc except sony already removed sd card jack they removed the changers too including sony removing the changer thats even worse all crappy brands dont like
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,hello yall want new phone and im used to huawei but dont know which one sh more depending on your budget if you arent trapped by google dependancy then huawei is good phome to get specifically those with kirin socs
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,example nova series
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,mostly not all of them example
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,which was developed partly because of the us sanctions against the technology giant from china more mostly not all of them
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei nova operating systems android harmony
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,we wait huawei nova at least well be getting the new harmony os
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,its great phone but find that the battery runs down quicker than expected and the charger is not much faster than watt charger that had on my honor pro so think that what charger is bit of scam try and trick people into buying it my honor pro uses about the same amount of battery power than this one and its power is and this one has nevertheless its great phone and takes nice pictures and has excellent sound
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,man you funny anyway we wait huawei nova
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,unsupported wifi next wifi nova man you funny anyway
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,another overpriced garbage no sd card no jack no google services small battery next more unsupported wifi next wifi nova
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,can we officially say this is midrange and nothing phone is great phone you can actually say that but im going to buy huawei tho huawei devices are great on optimizing their performance and for device that just came out we still dont know if we can get everything we want or nothing
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,wow im loving the matte blackgold combo
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,no chipset qualcomm sm snapdragon nm no wifi no android no harmony no ma battery no google play store not over euro
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei please make compact cheap starting price low radiation phones more agree have been looking for phone that is screen size with latest os but is also cheap
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,wow the selfie camera is gonna be the best in the world thats for sure too bad it doesnt have google services sigh
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,is it google support no
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,its just rebranded nova pro with slightly larger battery and few minor changes
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,mi lite ne or nova pro they have similar specs lite ne has but huawei always have better camera so your choice
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,really wish they put the kirin chipset for this pro version
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,rather skewed comparison google and facebook are known for exploiting their users personal data are google and facebook in nato countries is huawei get it now
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,finally stereo speakers has arrived on this device
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,phone in
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,many us companies like google and facebook are banned in china but im sure you havent said any more rather skewed comparison google and facebook are known for exploiting their users personal data
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,usa banned huawei the moment they surpassed apple and samsung in brand list this is true so true it almost happened to xioami just as the previous us president left office luckily it got overturned
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,rather odd set of selfie cameras
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,getting blacklisted by the previous administration in the us back in due to unfounded and more many us companies like google and facebook are banned in china but im sure you havent said anything about it
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,in this period huawei tries to suvive and am sure that huawei will come back and will be more stronger and will take avery good market share huawei now struggles in the chips they are allowed only to use certain snapdragon ships and version surely if huawei still producing kirin ships we will find more stronger ship in this phone and even if allowed to use mediatek ships they could use at least the dimenisty ship but on the other hand huawei tries to support other aspects to over come the weak ship point like giving you avery respective design and meterials an excellend modern screen found only in higher end phones and excellent camera espicially they are concerned with selfi camera and advanced charging system and finally avery amazing soft ware that gives you many advantages especially if you have other huawei devices so huawei fans only will understand this and still think huawei phones better than others if you dont trust you can simply goes to honor line that provides more different chip options
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,miss huawei
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,they keep on releasing old and same things same like iphone or samsungbored design
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,if huawei price is around this would sell lot
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,with these spec and without google services in eu is not worth more than eur feature phone
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,thank huawei the best
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,uggly back
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,old chipg no ois not worth anything above cause there are better phones at that price already probably gonna cost like which is way too much
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,sweet
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,imagine paying more for cruddy mp sensor to make bigger hole in the display and its not even an ultrawide lens or an ir camera for facial recognition horrible
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the performance of the nova was horrible worse camera without ois and terrible battery life this one brings little upgrade on hardware so cant be so optimistic about this phone sdgen soc imx camera sensor with ois and mah battery could make me think about this but with the leaked specs its no
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the screen size will be ppi mm wide which is same wide as screen mm tall wish it were mm wide screen with xp res
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,it is great phone when price is how is great price for this you can get better phones like galaxy as or poco for
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,interestingly the selfie camera on this is the only instance on this webside where the camera type is labled as portrait instead of standard or telephoto
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,the screen will be
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,huawei new devices look good but no bands even honor letting bands on their new devices still like both brands hh
Huawei,nova 10 Pro,with price under this going to be awesome device
Huawei,nova 10,for those who want to install any apps and play without problem just download aurora store more is it this better than gbox
Huawei,nova 10,huawei is the best
Huawei,nova 10,nah battery life is good for mah and screen is it get emui if this phone have mah it would be nice phone
Huawei,nova 10,good the only problem is batterydude lost percent every mins nah battery life is good for mah and screen is it get emui
Huawei,nova 10,now going for
Huawei,nova 10,honestly the phone is good camera is honestly good the ony problem is battery and gms services battery drains so quick on gms services all you need to do is download microg services and you can run almost any google apps overall
Huawei,nova 10,this guys must be comparing everything to xiaomi specs yes you have great battery google more xiaomi miui simply sucks killer updates deadboot wifi automatic disconnection and warning message like you have used your earphones for too long and bam the music player stops by itself im not fan of huawei but huawei emui and honor magic os are better far better than miui
Huawei,nova 10,need more information about battery life on this device is it drains quickly
Huawei,nova 10,how long does nova softwaresecurity supported looking at it it will probably stay on emui
Huawei,nova 10,im unable to install whatsapp
Huawei,nova 10,well about google services you just need to install global firmware then youll be able more how
Huawei,nova 10,kindly confirm about the apps installation that all the apps which are available on google play store are these apps are available on huawei devices if yes then what should be the method to install the apps either huawei will provide the app link or app itself
Huawei,nova 10,very good hardware huawei should make some sort of deal with google to enable google serv more well about google services you just need to install global firmware then youll be able to use google services and play store
Huawei,nova 10,ive still got my mate best ratio phone ever made imo the audio is also amazing still got my mate my mem is full and still kirin processor working great synchronizing many apps at once huawei is the best have it since
Huawei,nova 10,if you can live without google services without connectivity and if you find the phone at fair price you can consider the purchase otherwise decent phone in the midrange area with premium design and thats about it in the same budget there are slightly better equipped alternatives with google support connectivity memory card support gb instead of gb optical stabilization slightly more generous battery etc
Huawei,nova 10,bought the phone weeks ago and the only complains have is bun that it heats up while browsing on google or using tik tik instafacebook and the battery drains realy fast only get like hours of screen time
Huawei,nova 10,is the phone android
Huawei,nova 10,got mate with kirin and its still running flawlessly like new ive still got my mate best ratio phone ever made imo the audio is also amazing
Huawei,nova 10,where did get that information that kirin chips age badly got phone with kirin an more got mate with kirin and its still running flawlessly like new
Huawei,nova 10,another garbage comment from anon user the lack of card slot is deal breaker but at least there wont be any noticeable lags and snapdragon chips are known to have good longevity compared to kirin chips if youre not into and if the lack of headphone jack along with the playstore are not deal breakers then youre good to go besides that google maps and chrome still works without gms so dont see wheres the problem if have to buy new huawei will make sure that the internal memory is gigs no social media preinstalled and no kirin chips as they age badly
Huawei,nova 10,if there is no mm jack for earphones and no card slot how will you listen to music and tran more built in speaker or bluetoothusbc headphones there is sim card slot to transfer contacts jut not micro sd card slot
Huawei,nova 10,this phone feels nice in hands and selfie camera works really good tried with gspace app and more how do you stop the ads on gspace
Huawei,nova 10,mah in this age and time this guys must be comparing everything to xiaomi specs yes you have great battery googleplay good camera and etc guess what your phone automatic deadboot after year have mi with all of that features but look year no wiifi and hotspot overheating without usage fast battery drain and autoclose apps
Huawei,nova 10,stability of the phone could say it doesnt have on it tried to use it attach on my motorcycle when making videos it vibrates unlike other phones it will not vibrates so out for the rate
Huawei,nova 10,battery is map nova is mah can anyone tell me how is the battery life of more pretty good considering that the snapdragon is nm processor more performing and more energy efficient than the helio nm soc to make it short nm snapdragon with mah battery will have the same if not better battery life vs helio nm with mah battery
Huawei,nova 10,its nice phone so far everything is working good and ag is getting better each day
Huawei,nova 10,honestly if you die hard of selfie the mp front camera will take you to heaven but if you are not drama queen about selfie this phone will look expensive for nothing the nova se is more cheaper with bigger battery if you want nova the nova is the best or if you want latest the nova se is not bad at all and if you are crazy about selfie dont ask more question the nova is for
Huawei,nova 10,in pricetag thats crazy af huawei is literally dying since the us sanctions let alone its sub brand honor get more sustainable sales than huawei flagship they keep up with this shet they huawei should have stopped selling their flagship and midrange phones no no buy goodby huawei
Huawei,nova 10,please make full reviewi have been waiting for full review video
Huawei,nova 10,nova is still the best nova ever made absolutely
Huawei,nova 10,mkbhd jr sep seemingly great specs but not for its price point once again huawei dissapoints us with more have nova this phone improves on selfie camera only atleast when look at the specs its exactly the same battery is smaller than nova bought my nova for eur new its way more worth it and it looks way better
Huawei,nova 10,everybody love slim phones with lot of gb ram good job yes great job with this one selfie camera is absolutely stunning and hms is working perfect
Huawei,nova 10,based on specs nova is still better way better
Huawei,nova 10,great phones from huawei love them actually all specs are good and if you need gooble services you can download gspace from appgallery and everything works perfectly
Huawei,nova 10,look like elvis presley phone
Huawei,nova 10,seemingly great specs but not for its price point once again huawei dissapoints us with instead of phone that is released late and with its aging cpu that hz refresh rate will certainly be an extra as this chip is not powerful enough to run many modern games at high graphics on the other hand the camera is great but many other features are scarily similar to the cheaper previous generation nova
Huawei,nova 10,another overpriced garbage from huawei no sd card no audio jack terrible battery another garbage comment from anon user
Huawei,nova 10,why should anyone buy this when you can get the nova both phones are almost the same nova is much cheaper currently
Huawei,nova 10,dont forget it had kirin not crappynos or overheating dragon soc what are you talking about only gen overheated and thats because samsungs process and the little bit rest of the socs work totally fine
Huawei,nova 10,this phone exists only on gsmarena released july and nowhere in europe can see or buy
Huawei,nova 10,note that it doesnt say gorilla glass at display section in past thought gorilla glass wasnt big deal but seemingly it is if you bump the phone often noticeably typical huawei display cracks easier even with case on
Huawei,nova 10,nova was less than but was ok dont forget it had kirin not crappynos or overheating dragon soc
Huawei,nova 10,so its nova with smaller battery and better selfie why did they make it honor with mp main instead of mp
Huawei,nova 10,actually there are global version of them know that main and the nova is such great phone for the price yet its one of the only two avaliable in my area compared to how much there are in the chinese markets
Huawei,nova 10,kinda upsets me how they make so many nova series models yet none of them make it into the glo more actually there are global version of them
Huawei,nova 10,mm thin finally in long time
Huawei,nova 10,mah battery os better be optimize for this kind of small battery other wise every hours charging or maybe less
Huawei,nova 10,havent seen less than mm thickness in years
Huawei,nova 10,same specs on the last one but this one is much smaller batterynova battery is descent and now they just make it worst
Huawei,nova 10,this design is mindblowing absolutely beautiful
Huawei,nova 10 SE,how is battery life and one more question is it on emui or emui battery life is very good
Huawei,nova 10 SE,this phone sucks my son hates his phone never sale this phone again wow you lie have been using this phone for years and its the best phone ever had
Huawei,nova 10 SE,youre comparing the kirin which is cpu to the adreno which is gpu kinda make more it doesnt matter so you are saying snapdragon is better or on par with kirin lol
Huawei,nova 10 SE,your need to root the huawei nova nova se have play store
Huawei,nova 10 SE,the build quality and materials are topnotch but the software is disappointing the first and main issue is the inability to unlock the bootloader and switch to an aosp firmware the second problem is the interface which is cluttered with various poorly thoughtout features for example instead of the back gesture some unnecessary side menu with miniapps often pops up the quick settings panel is like broadway show of scrolling notifications and theres no way to influence any of thisthere are simply no settings available to disable these functions have tablet from another brand wont specify the model to avoid any perception of advertising with the exact same processor and ram but running pure androidit lags significantly less and offers flexible interface customization options
Huawei,nova 10 SE,the worst phone ever had even nokia its better cant use android auto its avalible to more whats even worse is how youre unaware about what happened to huawei and why google services need to be sideloaded clue donald trump
Huawei,nova 10 SE,sorry guys but this is an excellent phone yes the camera and the mic are not top notch more your need to root the huawei nova
Huawei,nova 10 SE,somebody recieve harmony os
Huawei,nova 10 SE,another shitty nova se model nova se still wins kirin is the best soc in huawei nova more youre comparing the kirin which is cpu to the adreno which is gpu kinda makes your point invalid
Huawei,nova 10 SE,regret buying this phone its not dual sim no headset portaux no radio wasted my money it is dual back and front
Huawei,nova 10 SE,they rereleased this phone as the nova se with new design just like nova se and they cared so little it identifies itself as nova se and has the same model number httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvghgznetou
Huawei,nova 10 SE,any problems with charging time takes hrs to full my battery
Huawei,nova 10 SE,how install harmony os on this phone
Huawei,nova 10 SE,highly suggest you should spend your money on instead of this garbage about the same pr more someone who havent bought nova se shouldnt buy it camera is scam
Huawei,nova 10 SE,for normal usage this is not user friendly phone at all text typing whatsapp email more mine works just fine use gbox
Huawei,nova 10 SE,how to connect head set try to use ai life app to conected headphones
Huawei,nova 10 SE,still cant beat nova performance so if have nova shouldnt upgrade yet
Huawei,nova 10 SE,it is horrible experience have faced ever camera quality is worst camera processor and day to day life support was truly funny and unsatisfying dont its competitive for todays world
Huawei,nova 10 SE,have been using till now everything worked well very smooth camera quite good battery good speaker good screen quite nice but processor should be better as other phones with this price come with better processor
Huawei,nova 10 SE,lol is garbage too dont know how to see good specs dont even have exp to use this more we can also assume youve never held any of these phones in your hands either
Huawei,nova 10 SE,im going to buy this smartphone for pesos its mos old and in good condition what do more thats good deal for pesos dont know what are people saying buy that phone doesnt even cost close to pesos
Huawei,nova 10 SE,im so disappointed my nova is way better than this thought get to upgrade my ph more what waste of money also upgraded to se pooh worst nightmare
Huawei,nova 10 SE,lol snapdragon why cant huawei just use like on redmi note
Huawei,nova 10 SE,recently got this phone and its quite good camera quality is good if dont use the default camera app use another app maybe snapchat or gcam if can other than that id recommend it
Huawei,nova 10 SE,snapdragon sucks and camera is not good my last nova was better
Huawei,nova 10 SE,sanctions eased huawei soon with google services again the us government is currently more
Huawei,nova 10 SE,very disappointed because overall device is too much slow not expected this performance from this device the amount paid for this device
Huawei,nova 10 SE,how quality of video oky its very good if you dont mind not having then nothing to complain about the stability is decent honestly been using my for almost years not single time have shot in honestly the nova se is the sleekest phone ive ever had
Huawei,nova 10 SE,writing my comment on my new huawei nova se screen is great smartphone is sleek and snapp more how quality of video oky
Huawei,nova 10 SE,so this comment is my final verdict for nova se ive been using it for more than we more can you tell me how sound of speeker on it it is really low
Huawei,nova 10 SE,it has sd wich is wery big diferenc than sd whats the difference
Huawei,nova 10 SE,yeah right the only specs change are the screen its oled and refresh rate hzother than more im so disappointed my nova is way better than this thought get to upgrade my phone but guess its downgrade based on experience it loads more than my nova despite having mp compared to the nova mo quad camera its not hd hence its more pixilated regret changing my nova to this ive been researching about nova se if it really is an upgrade but guess reviews from yt and google that happen to cross are not saying the whole truth just found out this website with users opinion if read these opinions before having this se for my plan couldve pick other model so disasppointing
Huawei,nova 10 SE,good in battery performance storage but not in camera and video no stabilization nova se more true waiting for new huawei midranger with kirin socs not low end kirin that they keep reusing
Huawei,nova 10 SE,nova se have better chipset than this adreno no gaming is buttery smooth in nova se even at pubg fps no framedrop
Huawei,nova 10 SE,ohh my experience of the phone is good especially for portrait photography it works well for photographing people at night no problems with daily software usage
Huawei,nova 10 SE,couldnt agree more am using the nova until now the difference is really big al more undeniable these nova series are deceitfulmuch more expensive than the galaxy which has oled panel exynos processor bigger battery google apps and videos recording seriously at fps my redmi can record at fps even though its an entry level smartphone
Huawei,nova 10 SE,what happen to huawei kirin chips they are very good based on my personal experience
Huawei,nova 10 SE,snapdragon in price tag this processeur is very bad even in and no google services this phone is really bad deal especially for gamers am really disappointed from huawei
Huawei,nova 10 SE,that was real beast couldnt agree more am using the nova until now the difference is really big although the nova se has oled display and the refresh rate has increased to but still when it comes to performance still killing the newest nova series hahaha but like the design of se
Huawei,nova 10 SE,have sense bro thanks dave
Huawei,nova 10 SE,same as me same too
Huawei,nova 10 SE,redmi note is the better choice compared and this does not have value enough
Huawei,nova 10 SE,better than nova value for money
Huawei,nova 10 SE,the design is really premium compared to other smartphone with the same price range will st more have sense bro
Huawei,nova 10 SE,am not into google mobile services same as me
Huawei,nova 10 SE,this phone cost php or approx usd and youll get sanpdragon plus no google servic more yeah right the only specs change are the screen its oled and refresh rate hzother than that its the same to its processor nova sei think until in the future with no google playstorehahaha
Huawei,nova 10 SE,why theres no review for nova se like on youtube want to know first thing is the build quality of this phone
Huawei,nova 10 SE,worst deal with sd and without google service
Huawei,nova 10 SE,the name yeah know that but is there performance differences
Huawei,nova 10 SE,good looking phone but bad cpu id pay if it had sd but with this not even
Huawei,nova 10 SE,whats the difference and the name
Huawei,nova 10 SE,its good phone in the made range phones and this phone should not be jump to
Huawei,nova 10 SE,midrange device without sd card jack of course nooooo
Huawei,nova 10 SE,beautiful device but why sd cant or be used mediatek dimensity
Huawei,nova 10 Youth,nova is already for youths and they are still making it youther
Huawei,nova 10 Youth,no mpx camera bad battery life scam
Huawei,nova 10 Youth,no no ltea cat no carrier aggrication no google play store services no wifi be and price is expensive customer estimate price us date
Huawei,nova 10 Youth,another terrible phone small battery no sd card no audio jack youre back how have you been nf use that for your name now so we know its are favourite friend whos back still saying the exact same thing see word for word just wondering but what phone do you actually use catch you on the next phone comments
Huawei,nova 10 Youth,huaweino more an android phoneso this site can ignore this brand this site are for all phones not just for android did see there also have others os phone at this site like iphone gsm phones
Huawei,nova 10 Youth,not gonna lie this phone is mid average with only isnt anything to go crazy over let alone newsworthy does around on antutu and around multi core and gb has lcd hz display granted hz is decent but is half assed compared to the hz most midrangers have today gb of ram is fine though the charging speed is less noticeable
Huawei,nova 10 Youth,very weird phone im not sure why huawei released it
Huawei,nova 10z,just copy of wiko
Huawei,nova 10z,its funny how theres existence of this phone
Huawei,nova 10z,huawei pleaseput in ur phones of the nova category not worth it
Huawei,nova 10z,wiko rebranding tinno makes every huawei phone so this is exactly the same with different ringtones
Huawei,nova 10z,samsung design where should find this in freetown
Huawei,nova 10z,no
Huawei,nova 10z,samsung design
Huawei,nova 10z,no wiko copied it from nova se good product
Huawei,nova 10z,think this phone is rebranded version of wiko no wiko copied it from nova se
Huawei,nova 10z,maybe you work in huawei company she may right about chip info
Huawei,nova 10z,sd poor huawei maybe you work in huawei company
Huawei,nova 10z,everyone go check out wiko think they are the same device altho the chipset appears to more sd poor huawei
Huawei,nova 10z,another rebrand what will be the chipset kirin hileo or other
Huawei,nova 10z,heard this has hz fps which think is really backwards progression
Huawei,nova 10z,not bad
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,no there is no workaround gspace gbox is not google used huawei includin mate pr more gbox now supports native play store installs just like aurora which the previous user failed to mentionmy banks have app gallery versions because we huawei users asked them to make one and those that arent on app gallery are usable even with just microg never used outlook but been using edge since day of my huawei purchase aslo managed to sign up for webex with my google login and linke my calendar even why is that xd at any rate just want huawei to just ditch android quickly so can have an alternative to uscontrolled softwareservices
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,no they are not please do not spread misinformation some apps can be downloaded and made to more strange my sideloaded banking apps work some even had app gallery versions maybe its an issue with your devs
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,no no go imagine wanting gliomas
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,would you please add information about pwm refresh in the display spec
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,the main and selfie cam are great it has nice design but expected better soc not that more im afraid that like the us forces qualcomm not to provide the latest chipset to huawei mean look the and mate only come with the notsolatest gen however thats just my theory though
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,huawei is rendered useless as honor exists uhhh no honors camera software is still worse iirc
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,official msrp is according to the huawei blog crazy expensive
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,but you can have google services on huawei phones its just bit of work to get them no there is no workaround gspace gbox is not google used huawei includin mate pro tell me what developer in appgallery published outlook and edge also webex meeting if this inspire trust to you good luck
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,all google services and apps are now available on huaweis app gallery no they are not please do not spread misinformation some apps can be downloaded and made to work but some apps require google play authentication banking apps and they will not work
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,because except google no brand gives to midrange same cam software of flagships even if it more in this particular case its pretty obvious that its nothing to do with soc as this phones frontfacing camera shows much more mature almost exemplary jpeg processing compared to that of the main rear camera
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,just gets worse cant be used for anything meaningful
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,worst phone ever lol
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,it is downright embarrassing that the selfie camera actually captures some amazing level of na more because except google no brand gives to midrange same cam software of flagships even if it had same soc cmos and lenses used by pro results would be way inferior just look how samsung does worse than
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,celia sounds like siri in chinese
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,should try the phone first just picked small detail to say the camera is bad every pho more dude he just said how it is checked the photo and its very clearly visible that there are some issues with it
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,another huawei phone that no one will buy outside of china why buy crippled device in markets with stable powerful devices are available with the same price huawei is so greedy asking such prices for its inferior devices
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,the main rear camera is clearly struggling to handle details in consistent manner across the more should try the phone first just picked small detail to say the camera is bad every phone have flaws
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,what are talking about the main camera quality is impressive have the nova main more the main rear camera is clearly struggling to handle details in consistent manner across the frame if you look at the fourth sample photo you can see that it renders the patterns in the balcony very well but the horizontal lines on the lower portion of the building are disappearing and the grass are melting because the camera somehow decided to apply significantly more noise reduction in those areas it also applies lot of sharpening to the image in general and this becomes especially evident in lowlight shots now compare that to any of the selfie samples from the main frontfacing camera neither the face nor the background looks oversharpened fine details are very gently treated and not getting smudged all over the place they shouldve used the same postprocessing algorithms for the main rear camera but huawei clearly couldnt be bothered to do that for some unknown reason
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,little bit more then year ago bought new samsung as for my grandma for direkt from samsung for this what are thesee companys smoking
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,higher score than iphone
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,terrible battery life no sd card no audio jack no google services another trash phone from huawei
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,still no google services
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,moto edge with from years ago is way better phone also usable rear cameras
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,huawei phone available everywhere lmao good one but regardless you can import any of the more notebookcheck has tested this and got ufs results unless huawei pulled samsung and gave the gb ufs and gb ufs thing also has wifi to make up for usb hopefully you aint citizen of the country that put huawei in this mess goodness cant wait for dues to paid in the future
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,dont compare huawei phones with other brands of course huawei is based as they are forging path to break away from google while the rest continue to be at the mercy of mountain view
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,lol dont compare huawei phones with other brands
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,nokia has much better specscheaper price lol
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,the phone in my country costs around and it have with snapdragon like if you look at samsung it costs in my country and it supports with water resistant and better processor
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,no or google services is no go for me there are ways around that but the good news is you at least have android phones with gms support that you can buy
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,still choose samsung over this
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,no google services no jack no memory slotno way yeah think they should at least have expandable storage on their next nova series phones
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,how did they mess up the battery life so much the galaxy as has quite similar specs sdg oled hz display yet it gets like in the battery test as opposed to just under and debloating oneui improves the battery life even more on the as and dont tell me that the small difference of instead of display diagonal makes this much of difference its ridiculous
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,theres also another issue the legion isnt available in lot of regions while the more huawei phone available everywhere lmao good one but regardless you can import any of these things into any country not ruled by tyrant and sure go ahead and cherry pick antutu scores of superior phones doesnt change the fact that its got less than of the performance even with your cherry picked score optimization my rear end that nova se has ufs storage while the has ufs storage ofc loading times are gonna be better than on cruddy poorly optimized samsung with slow storage this nova pro only has ufs while the legion has in addition to over twice the performance in general
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,pretty on the back ugly on the front hideous on the inside well its not hideous on the inside it has powerful processor called the snapdragon which is really optimized
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,go research some more and youll find plenty on youtube then give me link
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,because blame trump in for putting huawei on their stupid ass entity list just for the sa more well it kinda served him right when he stopped having the role as president
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,the worst thing that we are in but the phone has not network really sad because blame trump in for putting huawei on their stupid ass entity list just for the sake of american paranoia
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,and great more bullcrap claims about tougher glass cant find single more go research some more and youll find plenty on youtube
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,overpriced you better go for pixel or poco
Huawei,nova 11 Pro,it was the only differences between the pro and ultra are that the latter supports twoway satellite messaging through the beidou constellation and of course the price in httpswwwgsmarenacomhuaweiunveilsnovaproultrapriceavailabilitynewsphp but here in phones details the ultra model has different main camera so which one is correct
Huawei,nova 11,iphone huh
Huawei,nova 11,hi do you guys know another brand or phone that look like nova mean like that bezel more iphone
Huawei,nova 11,thats your fault its how you use it mine is on after year and three months dude if its stuck at thats bad it means that battery counter is frozen
Huawei,nova 11,this phones just goes off it freezes unable to start the screen is blank cant sense its more more cap mine is performing so well on emui really smooth too
Huawei,nova 11,great device microg solves all the problems great software performance also good camera
Huawei,nova 11,poor battery health after year and half my battery health its on and drops on my nova se after years battery health is on
Huawei,nova 11,how has been your experience so far its ok but converted my phone to harmonyos its much better works smoothly gms integration is better next time buy huawei phone will buy the chinese version with harmonyos in general the phone is ok
Huawei,nova 11,bought it today how has been your experience so far
Huawei,nova 11,does the gyro work in gaming
Huawei,nova 11,how do we know the ufs of this phone
Huawei,nova 11,so play one game at all it warms up for to minutes at most ill play fps alr more do you have gamespace enabled if so then apply it to your game which is assumbly on app gallery if it is from gspace or gbox then apply gamespace onto gspace or gbox where ever you got the game from hope this made sense
Huawei,nova 11,after many updates observe those apps did not work with out google now it run now as time go huawie is improving
Huawei,nova 11,hi guys ask you did saw to huawei nova how much po only gb assume youre in the philippines gb is not available here in the ph but the gb is on stores not sure on online stores
Huawei,nova 11,motorola edge neo or huawei nova moto if you cant live with sideloading gms on huawei
Huawei,nova 11,harmony os emui is equal to harmony os emui is equivalent to harmony os emui is equivalent to harmony os emui is in development but should be equal to harmony os these emui versions are exactly the same as their harmony os counterparts in every aspect
Huawei,nova 11,one week into using the nova edition yes edition what like smooth operat more harmony os
Huawei,nova 11,if you very simple user that google is not matter to you and contented with gbox or gspace its ok these phone offer sexy look thin and lightweight glance look no basel not bored to use for those love to dress the phone from icons over all these phone offer you many themes in themes store of huawie we can change every day the color inside our phone our sms section very colorful not boring to use for those like me love dressing my phone over all connection speed camera satisfied run smoothly
Huawei,nova 11,my games via gbox cashes it closed when your on the middle of the game gbox is not for gaming since its an emulator look for alternative gms sideload like lighthouse and rip off apks from aurora store
Huawei,nova 11,lighthousegboxgspace exists my games via gbox cashes it closed when your on the middle of the game
Huawei,nova 11,its almost perfect phone if you dont mention google services lighthousegboxgspace exists
Huawei,nova 11,have notification led light or not
Huawei,nova 11,when shall you bring it to the rsa market have been waiting for the release since april
Huawei,nova 11,an other nova
Huawei,nova 11,google apps are working fine through gbox no problems at all so far am bit sad that it is still but hey this phone gets pretty stable signal think huawei is known for this so this having no is not that big of an issue the camera superb just wish the battery was bit bigger like it could have been mah
Huawei,nova 11,no rather have xiaomi harmony bit slow and clumsy vs ios
Huawei,nova 11,woow nice phone im sucker for very narrow bezels on thin flat design the very rounded corners is also guilty pleasure of mines similar to the iphone hence guilty pleasure
Huawei,nova 11,camera like it recommended for
Huawei,nova 11,woah mah on such thin smartphone thats huge
Huawei,nova 11,whats the use of that rd camera at the back the rd sensor is color spectrum sensor idk how useful its gonna be but hopefully more useful that the mp depth camera they had on the last model
Huawei,nova 11,started looking for in online stores in my region didnt find it and then saw that th more exp release april it releases next week to be fair it could be possible it said different date previously
Huawei,nova 11,really got kunlun glass for flat screen nice
Huawei,nova 11,satellite available outside china
Huawei,nova 11 SE,hahahaha nova se still wins with great soc kirin and mali cores throw that adreno its super ancient and slow lol nova se still the best
Huawei,nova 11 SE,if you are chinese then you will understand how rubbish the huawei nova se is in the minds of chinese
Huawei,nova 11 SE,huawei really needs to shut down their budget phone business
Huawei,nova 11 SE,huawei where is your kirin cpu its very fast and smooth also we like kirin chipset
Huawei,nova 11 SE,in china this type of electronic rubbish is committed to harming elderly people who do not kn more indeed this phone have received lot of hate from tech reviewers because this is straight up trash indeed however physical stores will still tend to recommend these to elderies
Huawei,nova 11 SE,knock knock knock ram is still missing in the spec sheet
Huawei,nova 11 SE,thought they were gonna release new midrange kirin soc what happened clear old stock
Huawei,nova 11 SE,how much ram for the huawei nova se
Huawei,nova 11 SE,sd at that price huawei used to be reasonable now it doesnt make any sense for that price can get xiaomi note pro or pro with better processor and great design hope the kirin get back cause think it was the only reason huawei had better prices
Huawei,nova 11 SE,sd on almost phone and without stereo speaker lol even worse no sd card and mm jack low midrangers usually have these but not on huawei nova made by some random odm
Huawei,nova 11 SE,yeah suppose se stands for shitty edition apple is that you
Huawei,nova 11 SE,unbelievably overpriced just get the samsung its so much worth it than this thing what does the se actually mean oh wait shitty edition yeah
Huawei,nova 11 SE,those are qualclomm rejects being dumped to huawei even samsung have some of them too being us more edit samsung as
Huawei,nova 11 SE,dated soc no mm jack no card slotmicronano not kirin soc overpriced doa
Huawei,nova 11 SE,my only critic is probably the design though guess other brand are also occupied to these kind the design trend either way im not spending an almost usd dillan for this beuh
Huawei,nova 11 SE,snapdragon means this phone has no chance of success in the first place
Huawei,nova 11 SE,phone without stereo speakers cost that much
Huawei,nova 11 SE,seriously sdg with base storage this is impossible
Huawei,nova 11 SE,we dont need rams
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,sd card defender is more better than markerting defender hi guys is this phone good for gaming and others
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,good in being bad also bad in being good
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,no it doesnt support google it does via gbox all google apps can be downloaded however you wont get proper play store with gms so basically it does but with some cons
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,that back with printed letters is weird to say the least
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,because is super bad
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,wonderful phone relying on stable but somewhat old chipset one of the best front camera sensors on any phone quite possibly better main photography than anything relatively close to its price with dual aperture tech and color temperature sensor with huaweis software on top is still magnificent to this day has some odd features for mid ranger like leather back and satellite connectivity cant help but wonder what huawei would be like if they werent banned from using new chipsets this machine with gen would create an entirely new era for mid rangers hope to see this one out globally
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,curved display why because is super
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,mean use google drive and onedrive tbh not been an sd card user for about years now more micro sd cards are for very very small number of people now who actually need it for their jobsprofessional work and that exactly is the problem only crappy entrylevel and midrange phones have sd card slots but flagship phones for job or whatever necessary work other than sms and calls dont have sd card slots did anyone complain for their existence no so why did they abolish them to charge more money for socalled higher storage option it doesnt have to with how many people use it it has to do with cheaping out simple things nobody disliked
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,so when you shoot videos you never ever watch them on your pc what kind of silly argument more mean use google drive and onedrive tbh not been an sd card user for about years now can access any file want whenever want from whatever device that is logged in to my drives full quality picturesvideos if choose to have them in full quality have atleast over an hour of videos worth and about or more pictures all the way from the mp galaxy files and any other bit of data can save to it as soon as take picture or record itll upload the data and if want to then can delete the files on my phones physical storage cloud storage hasnt ever deleted or lost file using it since about and will not ever corrupt if it does the company is screwed transfers data way way faster than micro sd card and dont have to waste time removing it or the card becoming corruptdamaged micro sd cards are for very very small number of people now who actually need it for their jobsprofessional work the other half of those people dont need an sd card they just dont want to change their ways and will fight against anything they dont trust just like wireless headphones fact is they arent coming back it costs manufactures more to re design thwir whole device millions upon millions its costing companies and it ends up removing something that actually is useful again people dont want to come to terms with this just ignorantly dismiss it
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,its due to the us blocking companies like huawei from using technology developed by us comp more is mostly developed by hauwei us blocking huawei from accessing to semiconductor technologies
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,lol still snapdragon processor why cant huawei use gen or anything better its due to the us blocking companies like huawei from using technology developed by us companies hence why this phone is using an older snapdragon chipset that has variant maybe if snapdragon releases snapdragon gen or higher with modem these companies might be able to use them
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,adore gsmarena reviewshoweverplease take notebattery endurance ratings remain too critical to be omitted
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,good phone in this price but not good without google play apps this dont know how to read that the phone is using snapdragon processor
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,welcome to the world of elegance huawei
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,word ultra is huge selling point
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,id like the rolex crown on that green leather back
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,gsmarena needs to update this page because nova ultra and nova pro have the same specs
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,hopefully coming soon as honor proultra with hopefully more powerful chipset
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,man and why you would record on on inch phone screen seeing video or mak more so when you shoot videos you never ever watch them on your pc what kind of silly argument is that inch screen size phone with fhd resolution is stupid for reccording videos people want to store their memories in best possible quality do you know how or video looks on monitor screen try for yourself its not good in was shooting videos with my digital camera in best possible quality it had but today if want to watch those videos it looks awfull why not shoot in the best quality for the future standards recording in is pretty common these days captain not so obvious no matter which device we use for filming displays on digital cameras are not even in fullhd so why filming in right lol its amazing to see how low you can go in attempt of deffending the brands for not using the sd slot which is by far more affordable then internal storage on our phones sure maybe some people like to install many apps and for them sd card is useless but for others who want all their pics and videos in other words multimedia to be stored and easily swapable between multiple devices there is no more convinient and more affordable solution then the good ol sd memory card cheers and have fullfiled day
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,no sd card no audio jack small battery old cpu no thanks man every one phone could see you with anonymous name and argue with sd slot and audio jackand end up with no thanksjust wonder why you do this cause there are no points or rewards for your plenty of messages please just pick one phone you like from other brands lol
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,man using gb samsung evo bought years ago for euros its still working but every li more the evo series has been really problematic for some time even their pc evo storage options hasnt been doing well so think you just bought bad product samsung doesnt mean it is always good product their products have been plagued with issues like any other company before you say hate samsung am typing this from my galaxy just incase
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,pop up selfie is the best one for whose dont want cutouts and want an ips display but more they also add thickness and weight to the phone and are hard to engineer still id like to see popup camera phone today
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,cherry on the top would be the telephoto camera
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,please makers lose those hideous front holes for cameras under screen or pop up is the way to go pop up selfie is the best one for whose dont want cutouts and want an ips display but the problem is they wear over time unless there are people who doesnt take selfie too often
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,mm camera at the front okay this is interesting never see anyone put telephoto camera at the front
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,would not like to spend more for double the storage it is your fault if you dont us more lets say you were lucky but thats it
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,man you have no idea branded more expensive or less expensive card all are garbage and are more would not like to spend more for double the storage it is your fault if you dont use them and handle properly took great care of my gb sd card still has years of life left to get corrupted just need an size upgrade
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,thought theyd use kirin chipset
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,sorry but dont want to add more for bigger storage to store some files that more man and why you would record on on inch phone screen seeing video or makes no difference its litterary the same for that kind of reason filming on makes no sense apart you want fill your phone storage to full by making maybe minutes long video
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,man easily lose when you are drunk you cal loose everything phone credit card id drivi more sorry but dont want to add more for bigger storage to store some files that wont access for long time also if you record on much gb is surely not enough gb might be enough but you need to clean up your storage much
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,small update compared nova pro
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,memory card is garbage just because you used crappy non branded ones does not mean its more man you have no idea branded more expensive or less expensive card all are garbage and are easy to loose or breaks when often pop up from phone to another or so bigger phone storage is always better if said companies would they could give even or tb not just gb the disk inside the phione is really small and phone is big enough to carry even of them its not that hard
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,ive seen couple of comments regarding this mm jack vs the wireless earbud more man easily lose when you are drunk you cal loose everything phone credit card id driving license hom keys etc and memory slot is garbage even ufs is way faster more expensive memry combnation its not that much expensive phone dependable for most users or gb is more than enough do you really need so many prn hub videos
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,its the same chipset as on last years nova proi mean theres gotta be more really agree with you bro but special thanks for sleepy joe that huawei cannot produce the kirin chipset and cannot bought the latest snapdragon chipset think sleepy joes only freaking job right now is to ban china and huawei
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,harmony os windows phone more popularso chinese os less spyware track the weather ball more you sounded like mad caveman living in the jungle in the amazon
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,this one has nice color and nice design would be interesting with yellow and orange leather
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,thats what every anon would say just let them whine and tell them to buy an xperia even dont like the trend of removing mm jack and sd card wouldnt say that much here
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,sd for the past years insane
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,really hope this is just rumoured specs this cant come with the same old chipset
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,it was very capable chipset but using it on premium looking phone like these maybe it is competing with nothing phone
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,in huawei is htc of is it over for them
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,harmony os mean less spyware if put gms myself on does it still less spyware
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,ill just say this doa
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,snapdragon great feel sick already when read that snapdragon gen is great
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,front ultrawide camera with af so you can take macro shots of your face
Huawei,nova 11 Ultra,no ois no new snapdragon gen
Huawei,nova 11i,no nfc
Huawei,nova 11i,funny saw dozen people here suffering their bucks only for thin bezels this phone value nothing but the look you never saw ips with very thin bezels that expands screen to body ratio into xd
Huawei,nova 11i,buy this phone if you want absolutely nothing to work on it tell us what it doesnt work on yours instead the one we have in the family is fine enough is enough with huawei haters
Huawei,nova 11i,am very disappointed of this huawei novai because the wifi alwas authomatically disconnected
Huawei,nova 11i,the screen just goes off and on by itself it can last days while in freeze mode never dealt with this before
Huawei,nova 11i,this phone is good actually not bad it is good for gaming and it supports google play services and the emui version it doesnt support google play services and this phone is the best because the gaming experience was worth it and the db sound is gatling gun sound its heavy sounds and its absolute the best
Huawei,nova 11i,with an update to emui you can now use microg to get full google play services
Huawei,nova 11i,always turn on the performance mode and dang it became faster ever since will never turn it off as for the battery it is still manageable
Huawei,nova 11i,no google play most games doesnt work
Huawei,nova 11i,pro always snapdragon same specs as nova se and above
Huawei,nova 11i,these phones may be good but as notice in general they lack nfc so are useless if you want more wrong it has nfc
Huawei,nova 11i,still using this phone being months now see very bad comments and those are untrue yes this is true like it is disappointing that you cant download the common apps social media some games from the official gallery and you have to use third party to get your daily apps especially me used the app store called apkpure to download games called fcmobile and gbox to download apps instagram etc and it is totally false that the phone lags when you play games lol play pubg fcmobile roblox ball pool on it and it is great enjoyable of playing and what is great also the battery dont come down quickly like some stars smartphones not only that it also charge the phone less than hour having snapdragon on this woww great playing and more importantly this phone is getting emui update huawei already announced it officially when the releasing the update to the world and announcing which phones are supported to this new update this phone is great really like the battery durable like your phone still at high level when you just visiting or swapping apps or when you switch on am and was an iphone user comparing them used mostly this huawei nova daily not suggesting you buy this phone just giving my experience and seeing these bad comments really not pleasant not useful false things if you want professional camera just get nikon sony camera tho yeah this accept use iphone phone to take on photos because of its quality but this huawei also have good one too but wont lie if you searching for best camera phone look up for other phones
Huawei,nova 11i,very bad phone my novat is far more better than this pile of dust so lag in playing games not compatible with other basic apps highly recommend not to buy this shttty phone will save another cash to buy new phone been huawei user for yrs trashy phone
Huawei,nova 11i,am really disappointed by this phone always loved huawei from till my last phone was more you must just download directly from appstore
Huawei,nova 11i,this phone have very very low quality based on it selling price even my first smartphone honor is far away better than this the brightness is not so good after set to maximum its still not bright enough for me its camera also just scam already know huawei have no preinstalled google app but didnt expect it gonna messed up everything included my job after one month using this phone now am start thinking what is the value for this phone totally regret buying it
Huawei,nova 11i,who said this phone was bad
Huawei,nova 11i,love this phone the camera is good my problem is that cant attach files when trying to apply via online or even personalize my name for callbacks still miss my lost nova that one was perfect
Huawei,nova 11i,my hopes were exceeded by the huawei nova which recently upgraded to its robust performance and stylish appearance have made it an indispensable part of my everyday life
Huawei,nova 11i,awesome phone battery is good it is fast and it has some cool functionalities after having only samsung phones can say its good change im getting in love of huawei devices it works perfectly with my watch fit
Huawei,nova 11i,this phoneis not worth it for that pricelow specs no nfcno fm radioips lcd and most of all no google particularly the chipset usedit has low performance
Huawei,nova 11i,this is actually nice phone it has the mp camera and mp front camera and also its smooth perfect for all and the battery life is excellent would recommend although its quite new
Huawei,nova 11i,please answer is the display material durable yes
Huawei,nova 11i,youre right iphones are evolving backwards the phene works perfectly fine to any tech savvy person usa took away google from huawei thats why most of the apps you are whining about arent already preinstalled make use of gbox if you want your google apps
Huawei,nova 11i,no playstore no google no dont know why people still buying this you cant even spell anonymous but you busy giving bad comments about this smart phone lol
Huawei,nova 11i,terrible phone we should stop encouraging companies to make nonuser friendly phones for hips more youre right iphones are evolving backwards
Huawei,nova 11i,just let people buy what they want to buy if they prefer something because its brand more it has better signal than others
Huawei,nova 11i,to all people who still uses huawei get phone you
Huawei,nova 11i,no just because huawei devices doesnt have google apps and services installed doesn more okay how is the video and audio quality on youtube is it decent enough
Huawei,nova 11i,so youre saying that cant use the official youtube app only in web browser can download the youtube application using gbox gspace or better still download youtube revanced with micro to sign in your google account
Huawei,nova 11i,currently own this one ngl when bought this on their store it does already have google apps such as gmail chrome and so on can now use google apps except for google play services if want to add more google apps just use the app gallery and then search for what want just need the app with that gbox logo on the side
Huawei,nova 11i,huawei soon with its own chips and however the days of restrictions should soon be thing of the past huawei should be able to use chip developed entirely in china and would therefore have absolutely no disadvantages compared to the competition this should ensure that the sales figures continue to rise in addition huawei is to launch completely specially developed kirin chip which will initially be used in midrange cell phones so lot is happening at the chinese company network with four band operating system harmony wifi battery cycles capacity mah faster charging watts huawei nova coming in
Huawei,nova 11i,regret the day brought this phone its hard to use and other apps can be installed but more same here
Huawei,nova 11i,regret getting this phone its boring no google play store google home doesnt work more well you can only blame yourself you should instead regret not researching enough about this phone not the phone itself internet information is spoonfed to us nowadays all you need to do is tap tap little brain activity
Huawei,nova 11i,tested the device its really hard to use it without google service tried to instal more use the petal app and petal search
Huawei,nova 11i,evreything is fixed by gbox all google services are there even social media appsand it looks superfast device with the emui
Huawei,nova 11i,you can check honor smartphones they are far better than huawei
Huawei,nova 11i,nothing new unfortunately this almost realme which was better because it came with head jack and google services also using sd again in this is so frustrating
Huawei,nova 11i,realized that samsung gives garbage camera low fast charge and normal screen for eye protec more smart quality youll need to wipe the lens then it cant be that bad
Huawei,nova 11i,spend few euros more and get the samsung its basically miles ahead of this phone more realized that samsung gives garbage camera low fast charge and normal screen for eye protection also bad radiation when checked photo quality it was very close to old smart camera think huawei focus on something else and the battery life result should be also interesting
Huawei,nova 11i,really sd again
Huawei,nova 11i,can you make phone how dare you call it piece of garbage and what are you going to do about it
Huawei,nova 11i,no nfc is big no to me everything in south africa where this huawei phones are doing reall more agree some specs should be standard by now
Huawei,nova 11i,really love this phone the camera quality its very nicelike like everything about this phone
Huawei,nova 11i,thats not an entry level phone yes it is an entry level phone thats how its being marketed how its being sold and how its being lined up along with all of huaweis other phones
Huawei,nova 11i,it would have been better with audio jack and sd card its midranger why would even this is early sign of midrangers started to remove audio jack and sd card
Huawei,nova 11i,huawei is best but google not update so shift now one plus
Huawei,nova 11i,stunning phone for an entry level thats not an entry level phone
Huawei,nova 11i,too big exactly my thoughts
Huawei,nova 11i,too big
Huawei,nova 11i,the front is beautiful without frames it looks premium samsung learns that instead of reducing frames you make it more horrible every year lol next year samsung will launch the samsung with the design of samsung and make the notch in premium drop shape lol
Huawei,nova 11i,so glad huawei is sti pushing out over everything they have gone through long live huawei
Huawei,nova 11i,nothing new at huawei they just prove exist
Huawei,nova 11i,jeez is someone actually go to buy this
Huawei,nova 11i,nova is still best
Huawei,nova 11i,top tier overpricing
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,rear camera could be lil bit better no mm jack bluetooth version could be more they should have added ois
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,cptpower jan like it really matters its just phone not proffesional audio receiver or something cant even normie
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,jack is better bluetooth has no true low latency or dac like it really matters its just phone not proffesional audio receiver or something
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,cptpower dec jack is garbage bluetooth is slow anyway whether you have or it does not matter any wi more jack is better bluetooth has no true low latency or dac
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,how many software updates will the nova lite recieve
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,man sure feel today still happy with my as with the same chipset
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,nice design love the weight and slimness it makes big phones easier to use
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,ram huawei are playing apple now no ram reveal no chipsets
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,ram
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,more rebrands horrible might as well continue selling the but updated to ship with android out of the box and receive updates starting from then
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,how much ram
Huawei,nova 12 Lite,how dares huawei use the chipset for too long
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,too bad this phone isnt being released elsewhere
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,telephoto on the front cam and none on the rearthat sucks
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,the soc is kirin got around ak in antutu the phone is cool harmony os is very smooth
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,wifi compatible uh wlan category on the specs sheet maxes out at wifi
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,its not even flagship its budget device with low end processor the popup camera is not more if xiaomi could make the poco pop up cam lift gym weights why cant huawei and those ip ratings are bit of sham as ip certifications on youtube look too lenient just few minutes in fresh water but consumers dunk them on seawater and chlorinated pool water
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,huawei is coming back to the game efficiently plus think harmony os is about to launch globally emui is perfect mirror of harmonyos its basically harmonyos with emui branding same features and all
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,then the huawei prime will be the most supreme flagship from huawei of all time as it more its not even flagship its budget device with low end processor the popup camera is not good idea since it sacrifices durability and water resistance
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,good phone only difference with ultra model is kunlun nano glass have new kirin sl who is only of smt hyper threading is on chip boosting performance and is on par with nm gen and nm in hands on work test and have new nearlink tech wifi bluetooth in once in new form
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,in fact the nova pro uses the kirin chip while the nova ultra using kirin sl more well thats something
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,xperia iv blocks your path well yes and thats litterary new phone
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,no ios again its not even supposed to support ios you have to opt for iphones for that
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,probably because the pro didnt get updated since but point still stands your more my point is just that bigger hole in the display is nuisance do need to simplify it further
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,why would you mention the prime when theres literally pro probably because the pro didnt get updated since but point still stands your argument about bigger punch hole doesnt make sense
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,battery life for example good joke lenovo from had qualcomm msm snapdragon nm and the battery life way better than any other phone on theses sites with battery up to mah regardless of brand
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,pro has bigger hole in the display than the lite model then the huawei prime will be the most supreme flagship from huawei of all time as it has whole screen without hole punch by your logic with pop up camera instead
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,why whole nova lineup dont support ois for cameras at least main sensor
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,as dumb as it seems to be you do realize the pro and lite labels arent based on those more obviously companies are stupid and seem to believe everybody values more stupid selfie cameras over less of an obnoxious hole in the display
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,wth with copying xiaomi removing expandable memory and pairing it with usb unless it has nearlink to make up for the lack of decent wiredphysical dongle transfer
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,nothing excellent chipset is simply downgrade anyways that is true according to benchmarks and the phone is using the kirin slightly underclock version of the kirin if am not that mistaken antutu could not get very accurate benchmarking on the chipset because it is new but as always it is not all about the numbers but the actual experience
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,yup from ytube tech expert under nm the difference is not that huge its just marketing to tr more lots of people still need to be educated they get blinded by big numbers but turn blind eye on other factors like sustained performance or that these arent running oneui or miui
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,downgrade compared to what the that was in the nova pro how would that be downg more oops thought the nova pro ran on snapdragon gen mixed things up
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,looks beautiful in that blue those bezels look sick too like it shame it has virtual proximity sensing with that rather large front cutout
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,please release this phone with the kirin internationally huawei please
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,some other sources says nova pro will come with kirin nova ultra come with kirin sl
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,lots of clouds over the kirin chipset none is really sure about the specifications so more is closer to nm generation its denser than tsmc
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,considering that the processor is nm its not so wow lots of clouds over the kirin chipset none is really sure about the specifications so calling someone ignorant over this is kind of ignorant too btw if kirin is really made by smic its made on nm process
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,years old prosscer and clock speed no wifi price this is not xiaomi
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,for me nanometers dont even matter like what difference does nm and nm have that will hav more battery life for example
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,now this smartphone looks like
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,you do realise each company has their own definition of what the size of the node is nm real more for me nanometers dont even matter like what difference does nm and nm have that will have great enough impact to effect my daily use
Huawei,nova 12 Pro,what is about kirin that huawei said it was ready to this series of nova check nova instead
Huawei,nova 12,hi the huawei nova is this phone avialeble in south africa buy two one for you and the pmb scholar who isnt answering your question
Huawei,nova 12,operating system harmony next and no support in germany
Huawei,nova 12,have checked my nova is with kirin chipset and ship with harmony os in the box both of the front and rear camera is able record kfps video with gyroeisais both front and rear camera is with ultra wide mode for kfps for game playing able to run smooth genshin impact with max setting st fps
Huawei,nova 12,god its been full months still no one know kirin specs
Huawei,nova 12,bought matepad outside china and it has harmony os preinstalled out of the box all huawei tablets come with harmony os
Huawei,nova 12,as this phone is probably china only so its about harmony osand not emui it will get more bought matepad outside china and it has harmony os preinstalled out of the box
Huawei,nova 12,and how many specialists told us china is not able to produce microprocessors days ago intel ceo gelsinger says china is ten years behind in chipmaking capabilities and it will stay that way today read here that the phone was launched on january many do not understand what is coming economic reality shows reality words are words
Huawei,nova 12,after years finally the next step of
Huawei,nova 12,does this have google pay services does you need them you can always install gblox app which will add you nice android over your harmony os and everything will works for you like you have android in your phone
Huawei,nova 12,from reports from bilibili this phone uses mixed chipsets with one type with kirin and the other with kirin
Huawei,nova 12,so im finally giving up my finally another kirin
Huawei,nova 12,for this
Huawei,nova 12,theres also nova lite or vitality edition rebranded nova with harmonyos
Huawei,nova 12,another smic processor have kirin and its beast didnt get tired after years no overheat issues
Huawei,nova 12 SE,huawei needs to improve their camera quality plite novat plite is way better in terms of camera quality why theres this whitish from front camera its like ai generated picture the only good thing is the battery
Huawei,nova 12 SE,recently purchased this phone camera quality is very bad am totally disappointed am new customer of hauwei my life this is last purchase of hauwei product
Huawei,nova 12 SE,camera quality is very poor you it looks like mobicel
Huawei,nova 12 SE,this is my st time using huawei product to me its built with high quality materials from the body to charger it charges from to takes about minutes which is fast for me could use all google services with rd party software installed im happy with it so far
Huawei,nova 12 SE,images taken with mega pixel front camera are very bad loks like they were taken with mega
Huawei,nova 12 SE,bought last tuesday so far unit is good fast charging as advertised some applications can be installed at gbox updating can be done at appgallery huawei trademark is the sharp and crisp images from camera also having dual screen as added feature this brand never fail my expectation
Huawei,nova 12 SE,huawei discovered the why just all your phones are wonder you lost your project more its very simple due to huawei getting sanctioned and removed off the us market they lack hardware and struggle with limitations
Huawei,nova 12 SE,maybe they keepin it budget friendly thats why they stick to its not that bad really
Huawei,nova 12 SE,sd again how many sd do have huawei nobody will buy this rubbish lol
Huawei,nova 12 SE,totally agree
Huawei,nova 12 SE,ther most disappointing newer nova ise series ever heard how many snapdragon you got huawei
Huawei,nova 12 SE,btw its pretty much the same as the huawei nova se different in name only
Huawei,nova 12 SE,huawei this is scam there is little to no difference when you compare this to the se or more they have been recycling this for quite some time now same chip etc there are better options out there
Huawei,nova 12 SE,you poor people who bought this phone with shitty adreno no wonder the camera image proc more agree huawei nova huawei se are the best of their generation of huawei phones
Huawei,nova 12 SE,poor people who bought this phone listen guys the huawei nova se is the best nova se phone of all with kirin and core mali graphics eat that shitty andreno lol
Huawei,nova 12 SE,cant huawei use mediatek any longer you have mediatek helio which by far better than the that huawei uses for some years now so bad
Huawei,nova 12 SE,so nova se with half the storage why whats the point actually the same amount of storage
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,huawei please bring back the telephoto camera in nova series the nova had and the nova pro had telephoto after that the telephoto was discontinued why
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,everyone does and say it as huawei user for example making phones without sd card slot more huawei used nm card dont micro sd develop nm card rare brand huawei
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,hello there the least huawei phones in this site is missing the ram and chipsets can you fix more kirin sl rebrand kirin dont lauch new soc
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,how come this phone does not have ram it is have but the information is not availablei think
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,never question what huawei does they never make mistakes everyone does and say it as huawei user for example making phones without sd card slot but use only usb specification for wired connection
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,but at least make the ultrawide camera mp or mp and then make it support fps or more well for you is important many uses just run the photo app and press click when making photos they dont know how to use other camera setups and those many users are majority to be honest
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,cptpower jan like anybody cares main camera is most important not the support ones but at least make the ultrawide camera mp or mp and then make it support fps or fps
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,but no fps recording that means like anybody cares main camera is most important not the support ones
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,mp ultra wide for ultra tsk tsk ultra is pro with extra storage and leather back in nutshell
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,th nova series nd stillcdoesnt have ois its especially weird because the plus variant of the very first nova actually had ois httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweinovaplusphp
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,huawei shouldve put the telephoto camera on the back instead of on the front
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,uh take away your two front facing cameras makes the device ugly keys without bro
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,some websites say sl
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,this chipset is officially confirmed to be kirin or
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,where can we find these phones its hard to but huawei phones here in singapore
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,neither of the two can be purchased outside china the prices for both of them in this website more oh they do sell outside china but maybe not at your country or especially the country and their allies that banned them and suprisingly for those who dont know the one sold outside china is with global rom version
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,and theyre placing it in the middle but it wont change anything huaweihonor is still the first one
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,if this one is available on the global market neither of the two can be purchased outside china the prices for both of them in this website are conversions from chinese currency and compared their price to performnce ratios if this nova ever makes it to the global market they will ask the chinese price of the mate
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,read the chinese news and apparently the ultra and pro will come with downclocked kirin the fastest core is only downclocked by mhz or so
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,another iphone think huawei doing mistake copying their products know they doing it more you need to visit your eye doctor
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,mp uw is trash for ultra phone bro remember apple used or mpix for very liong time and they still made perfect photos if you really think its all about mpix then you have no knowledge about cameras and photography mpix ultravide should be perfectly fine
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,this or the fold cant decide this since folding phone is nothing but crease and an easy to damage screen with more cons than pros
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,lmao
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,waiting for the pro come on gsmarena post some news
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,that pill and wallpaper is inspired by apple before dynamic island no one used pill notches more sony had that wallpaper before apple btw
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,strange that this phone doesnt have wireless charging but has reverse one probably does but just didnt list stats prob
Huawei,nova 12 Ultra,huawei had dynamic island on their honor phone before apple wt you on about and theyre placing it in the middle
Huawei,nova 12i,compared this phone to my oppo im shocked huawei newer few months in model but older in more thank you for that info but at least its google free that makes it awesome
Huawei,nova 12i,its very good for the price upgraded from samsung and can say it is much better will nova get emui
Huawei,nova 12i,hi have you gotten it and if so how is it so far did indeed been using it for good months now got it for an insanely low price almost off when bought from the huawei online store and used their discound and previous points gathered from buying tablet from themalso got free band fitness watch phone is great the camera couldve been better its definitely not high end but it does the job really well as someone who takes casual pictures of course theres no preinstalled google apps but got everything need on here you can also still download some apps through playstore but recommend using the official huawei app gallery screen is really nice and large pretty much no bezels charges full in about an hour overall really really nice phone only real complaint is that cant do screen share to my huawei tablet but can still share files through huawei share in seconds overall score can give for this phone that bought for like
Huawei,nova 12i,bruh have decision to choose between these people absolutely flaming this phone and the more hi have you gotten it and if so how is it so far
Huawei,nova 12i,if they made it compact make the camera layout like se amoled screen
Huawei,nova 12i,also regret buying this me so very disappointed with the camera
Huawei,nova 12i,honesty this has to be the worst phone in terms of camera maybe im not using it well but it sucks the photos and video looks like were taken by mobicel very disappointed
Huawei,nova 12i,kinda feel like ive been scammed had the and it wasnt this bad when new its the cpu thats problematic camera aint good either better off adding some bucks for cus as uses the same cpu and cost nearly half nothing special glad have sold it and looking in for new one
Huawei,nova 12i,just get nova se the same specs as other nova sei thats not truesd cpu on nova is clocked at much higher rate than se and and mah battery
Huawei,nova 12i,bought nova just few weeks agothe camera is not really good sometimes it lags thought more also regret buying this
Huawei,nova 12i,beautiful phone how much will cost
Huawei,nova 12i,realme is much better than this the has google service framework sd chip ship more nova se is much better than your realme lol kirin still wins
Huawei,nova 12i,even realme is better than this those phones have in sensor zoom and can also use on portrait mode
Huawei,nova 12i,yoooohuwaiewhy not super amoled and cam
Huawei,nova 12i,what
Huawei,nova 12i,ips lcd
Huawei,nova 12i,lets not forget the age gap between the and the and later phones which is nearl more yeah the argument makes sense but as said they both collaborated with zeiss so guess they just put the zeiss magic or something on the design but yeah the thing is too far unless you count the iphone pluss design
Huawei,nova 12i,ehh thats far fetched allegation id say that there can be an argument for vivo more lets not forget the age gap between the and the and later phones which is nearly years at least the argument should make sense in this case can take things too far to and call the nokia the grandfather of all modern sonybranded phones and pillshaped camera islands if you like those designs in particular
Huawei,nova 12i,just bought one few minutes ago huawei direct sale incl tax
Huawei,nova 12i,or all of them copied the nokia simple ehh thats far fetched allegation id say that there can be an argument for vivo copying the nokia with their pro and especially their pro phones but since theyre both collaborating with zeiss guess its fine
Huawei,nova 12i,realme copied huawei and huawei recopied realme or something man lmao or all of them copied the nokia simple
Huawei,nova 12i,lowend phone with no mm jackexpansion storage doa
Huawei,nova 12i,what bigass camera bump
Huawei,nova 12i,curious bout price
Huawei,nova 12s,tzmkira apr love huawei but who would ever get this when you can get the oneplus much much bette morenot available in my country but huawei is funny
Huawei,nova 12s,copypaste nova device
Huawei,nova 12s,werner sep hi the huawei nova is this phone availeble in south africayes at takealotthough its cheaper on their website httpsconsumerhuaweicomzaphonesnovasbuyskucodegadsourcegclidcjwkcajwpbhbeiwaidbtmxlnjcycdxhgvnzvmhocwsqrwgsvqqvqtaycbdlrocdhiqavdbwegclsrcawds
Huawei,nova 12s,this product offers exceptional value for its price although there are concerns regarding the performance of its processor
Huawei,nova 12s,anonymous apr would anyone recommend this phone if youre shopping for midrange huawei phone with morethis huawei pura normal
Huawei,nova 12s,after owning iphones and samsung phones and tablets can say that the novas crushes them in these categories camera display speakers weight speed of handling and reaction time of display and apps however as impressive as huaweis hardwear is as crappy are their protective cases you have to go to amazon to find better ones and they are always shipped from shenzhen which takes forever and those still arent as good as otter box ie the weird protruding camera on nova gets scratched easily because it is exposed this bothers me lot
Huawei,nova 12s,anonymous may seems like nova pro with lower screen res no gb option and instead of for no moreits closer to the nova exact same dimensions and cameras except the has stereo speakers in answer to your queries yes they do sell it here im one of those rare few who enjoys emui and can handle the lack of gms just fine
Huawei,nova 12s,would anyone recommend this phone if youre shopping for midrange huawei phone with flat screen there isnt lot of other option
Huawei,nova 12s,jon apr until huawei has catches up to qualcomm at least years away and starts using its own chips moredont worry theyll get there as long as the loser us doesnt go below the belt like what theyre doing to tiktok now httpswwwbnnbloombergcahuaweitestsbruteforcemethodformakingmoreadvancedchips
Huawei,nova 12s,until huawei has catches up to qualcomm at least years away and starts using its own chips on their nova phones this series wont be worth getting even for chinese customers easily outclassed by any midranges out there and only the matepura series are somewhat worth getting
Huawei,nova 12s,love huawei but who would ever get this when you can get the oneplus much much better phone in every way and for cheaper
Huawei,nova 12s,no
Huawei,nova 12s,justasmile mar its practically the same as nova true like nova have nova same specs
Huawei,nova 12s,anonymous mar no sd card audio jack small battery no thanks youre stuck with low endniche samsung and xperias with the first two wifi might make up for the lack of sd card but ill just wait for huaweis global model that has nearlink and nanomemory whenever they release it
Huawei,nova 12s,no sd card audio jack small battery no thanks
Huawei,nova 12s,darlingyext mar so its just nova lite with stereo speakers httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephp moreits practically the same as nova
Huawei,nova 12s,camera setup same as ugly as oppo reno
Huawei,nova 12s,wow only gr for in and mm thick this is super sleek handset thought my was light at grmm at in huawei takes it one step further
Huawei,nova 12s,so its just nova lite with stereo speakers httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Huawei,nova 12s,front looks nice back looks kinda interesting
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,hey there woukd like to ask for ur opinion the huawei nova pro or huawei pro had pro and its great but it has hz only id recomand to get nova pro pro still solid but its geting old
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,just checking today there is missing some specs subject like chip line is blank
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,for kirin its overpriced
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,yeah like who needs it maybe for narcissist will need it one day when mak ing phone call to some one like and ll find it very handy believe it everyone wants to look the best and nobody wants to look ugly and this nova series have kept me look ing and interested and might buy it one day dudes

Huawei,nova 13 Pro,need huawei phone like huawei nova huawei phones without google play store is hurting co more my next phone will be phone without american services xd
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,if you compare the kirin and dimensity their gpu are similar ofcourse they used same armv architecture however huawei fell off with nm and gpu who is mhz slower and mhz slower core thus the kirin is just heavily nerfed version of dimensity but way much pricier
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,huawei phones even with harmony os they doesnt support google play compeletly most more have huawei phone and the apps installed all work perfectly fine love the camera and durability of the phone huawei is still the best
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,harmony is only used in china not worldwide bad date huawei phones even with harmony os they doesnt support google play compeletly most of the apps doesnt works miss huawei go for honor
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,huawei doesnt use qualcomm or mediatek they have always used their inhouse kirin chips more wrong this uses the kirin
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,in europe it dont support and the chipset is kirin huawei thats not cool in it was understandable why didnt release to the europe but its cmon nobody is that die hard fan
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,should update the network specs not all region supports maybe in china only
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,is this one works without cpu huawei put inan kirin soc and supported network only
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,wow the first phone that works without chipset incredible perhaps the most innovative thing ive seen all year from phone brand
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,what the chipset how they to put in the blankets about the chipset qualcomm or mediatek huawei doesnt use qualcomm or mediatek they have always used their inhouse kirin chipset and this one has the kirin
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,megapixels on selfie camera thats new thing it isnt even the nova had mp
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,whos gonna need telecamera for selfies and probably upto digital zoom maybe when you want to show bottom of your throat to your friend
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,chipset is kirin if you dont have things to say keep your status shut
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,chipset used chipset is kirin
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,chipset used huawei hasnt revealed the chipset unfortunately
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,any info about the chipset
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,its because they have two front cameras wide and ultrawide see in specs telephoto not wide front cam
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,im fan of nova series since then even though havent had one before got my more its because they have two front cameras wide and ultrawide see in specs
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,imho the design is great compared to other chinese manufacturers who seem to be following the same design language which is boring for me
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,ive said it before and ill say it again huaweis gotta find new design tea more well to me its very beautifull unlike samsung google sony or apple where every year same ugly boring design if anyne needs new design team its those companies huawei did great and phone have its own visual characteristic where it doesnt looks creepy and cringer like said brands where low cost device looks exactly as high cost one and apart of disgusting look does not come with any other innovation at all
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,childish and ugly camera design first time
Huawei,nova 13 Pro,it is not as bad as iphones camera bump on different matter aluminosilicate glass more meh the iphones camera has become boring because theyre overusing it but its far from ugly
Huawei,nova 13,you can buy any huawei phones and install gbox in it amd all your google problems more can you download dreamleague soccer from gbox

Huawei,nova 14 Ultra,huawei still have snapdragon and kirin in stock that is why they will release phones with that after snapdragon went out of stock huawei decided to make own chipset also for midrange phones reminder qualcomm will no longer give huawei snapdragon chipsets even chipsets
Huawei,nova 14 Ultra,its cheap budget phone created for female chinese influencers that cant stop hav more female korean influencers
Huawei,nova 14 Ultra,did you watch the presentation dont think that they have the correct specs right now yeah they dont they just updated some specs about the chip and screen today so guess they arent fully accurate right now

Huawei,nova 7 5G,if can link with google playstore would be
Huawei,nova 7 5G,realme superzoom or this one this one bro or better yet the novat
Huawei,nova 7 5G,uber works
Huawei,nova 7 5G,it sucks when you cant use important apps that require google services like what
Huawei,nova 7 5G,can know is there an easy way and the last working way to install google services please
Huawei,nova 7 5G,someone tell me about every single problem in this phone please and whether to buy it or not
Huawei,nova 7 5G,google available in this mobile android emui no google play services
Huawei,nova 7 5G,fadysaber aug got this device and it is good one but notice that its battery getting hot at the more by any chance is your previous phone yo phone or more think the part that heated up is the processor not the battery it might be normal because phone these days does heat up more than they used to
Huawei,nova 7 5G,no service in service center always reshoulder battery and screen problem bad could you please tell us what is the problem with the battery
Huawei,nova 7 5G,how to purchase online transactions like pubg uc cash or gold in coc with out play store huawei uses its own store
Huawei,nova 7 5G,as there is no google play service can insert my google account and install my preinstalled apps
Huawei,nova 7 5G,how do get to download app like careemuber and instagram on my huawei you can go their website to download apk
Huawei,nova 7 5G,bought one days ago and dont regret it at all it doesnt bother me not havin more yes same think they wont include play store because they literally putting so much cash in app gallery especially with regional apps and instead of apkpure you can download from petal search its huawei own app and it downloads apps from multiple sources like apkpure aptitode etc
Huawei,nova 7 5G,lacks of ois
Huawei,nova 7 5G,which is better chipset realme or nova
Huawei,nova 7 5G,huawei always cheat android version of that unit is fake no no huawei not again and never no service in service center always reshoulder battery and screen problem bad
Huawei,nova 7 5G,all is good with the nova but the main disadvantage is google playstore would be better if more huawei released app called petal search thats installed in every huawei devices it directly downloads app that are not available on huawei app gallery from rd party app store thats mainly aptitode apk pure and it will also help with updates check out petal search
Huawei,nova 7 5G,how come its says andriod but no google its means it is not android im correct to not no its android but huawei cant use google because of america china trade war there is an app called petal search that is already installed on all huawei smartphones that searches all apps that are not available in huawei app gallery and its easy to manage try it
Huawei,nova 7 5G,video recording or only fps not fps
Huawei,nova 7 5G,nova has google play store no they havent
Huawei,nova 7 5G,screen recorded available or not available
Huawei,nova 7 5G,still not available here in saudi arabia
Huawei,nova 7 5G,gotta admit that its not the google im afraid not having for its the apps more that is true encountered some apps ie teams bit torrent that displayed an error something like the app needs gms to function but kept working anyway
Huawei,nova 7 5G,try app finder in huawei app galllery and then search if you are lucky then you are good to go you can use apkpure store and find any app that you want its better than google store
Huawei,nova 7 5G,is wrong no doubt if youre talking about speed ghz ghz there is just no way more youre the exact type of guy that bought an fx back in because you thought because it hit ghz it would be the fastest
Huawei,nova 7 5G,im very disappointed becasue no much apps available and no google play store thought it would be great phone but its not possible to install anything in this nova
Huawei,nova 7 5G,use petal search or external app gallery like aptoide or apkpure or if you previously use hua more try app finder in huawei app galllery and then search if you are lucky then you are good to go
Huawei,nova 7 5G,anybody guide me how can install external app in hiawei nova becuase one app not instal more use petal search or external app gallery like aptoide or apkpure or if you previously use huawei phone install the app with your old phone then use phone clone
Huawei,nova 7 5G,and ahhthe legendary dimensity which expected to break the market price but somehow more if the dimensity never went outside the chinese market then how come im able to buy iqoo equipped with the dimensity and how come im able to buy redmi equipped with the dimensity live in the us that doesnt matter predecessor isnt supposed to have better performance period
Huawei,nova 7 5G,not that guy but since when did kirin fell behind mediatek also keep in mind that nova isn more kirin fell behind mediatek when the dimensity released thats quite bit faster than the kirin buddy the nova had the kirin this is supposed to be the successor use some common sense no phones arent competition for anything the faster dimensity exists in phones the is joke and speaking of the dimensity found in phones this is only on par with that this phone is terrible its not just bad in any way its absolutely awful
Huawei,nova 7 5G,ahhh now you finally put it in english thats able to be comprehended though proper engl more not that guy but since when did kirin fell behind mediatek also keep in mind that nova isnt proper flagship its competitor is phones with sdg which still far below although kirin is cheating with the performance mode theres indeed some cheap sd like poco pro but thats doesnt mean this phone is bad in any way and for whats it worth huawei bundled this phone with bunch of free gifts
Huawei,nova 7 5G,guess this has oled from chinese company but what th refreshing rate of this screen and protect type
Huawei,nova 7 5G,its it worth to buy or not torn between poce pro or nova
Huawei,nova 7 5G,how the gms would affect the us in any way trump should revise his decision because its no logic to cut this service from huawei mobiles
Huawei,nova 7 5G,no gms ok bye
Huawei,nova 7 5G,does this device support google services
Huawei,nova 7 5G,hahaha cant you really understand my simple question or you just dont know the ans more hold on my reply is awaiting approval by moderator answered your question in it
Huawei,nova 7 5G,dug is the past tense of dig you said on right after dug whic more hahaha just answer my question rather than dealing with this english thing so as not to further expose yourself do yourself favor check the sentence and know the use of prepositions
Huawei,nova 7 5G,what does it mean no google play services it means play store is not available please tell me huawei mobile service no gms
Huawei,nova 7 5G,are you not aware that dug is the modern standard form of digged exposed fyi its more dug is the past tense of dig you said on right after dug which makes no sense in almost every sentence and this isnt an exception even if you didnt say on it still makes no sense you cant dig language unless youre trying to use dig as synonym for like even if you were trying to use dig as synonym for like you said dug not dig thats like saying you liked dogs instead of you like dogs the only reason you wouldnt use the latter is if the person youre talking to no longer likes dogs
Huawei,nova 7 5G,you dug on the english language are you not aware that dug is the modern standard form of digged exposed fyi its fact and not just my opinion
Huawei,nova 7 5G,hahaha you cant understand but youre continuously responding unfortunately you more you dug on the english language
Huawei,nova 7 5G,doesnt take an english professor to type comprehensible english the problem here isn more hahaha you cant understand but youre continuously responding unfortunately you dug on the english language but were not able to answer my question regarding the comparison between the kirin chips used on these nova phone siblings
Huawei,nova 7 5G,then go to an english writing forum and not here which is for smartphone users as you seems mo more doesnt take an english professor to type comprehensible english the problem here isnt me making petty corrections its you not being able to type something thats able to be understood what dont you understand about that
Huawei,nova 7 5G,want legible english then go to an english writing forum and not here which is for smartphone users as you seems more like an entitled wellversed linguist
Huawei,nova 7 5G,im gonna need you to repeat that but in english so its not english for you which one you want then formal or informal english fyi im huawei honor user thats why know how kirin performs on actual daily usage
Huawei,nova 7 5G,just really how weak compared to to be major concern im gonna need you to repeat that but in english
Huawei,nova 7 5G,bruh they really put weaker chip in this than they did in the previous nova just really how weak compared to to be major concern

Huawei,nova 7 SE,nova se or redmi note pro which is better value for money go for xiaomi this has no google
Huawei,nova 7 SE,im planning on buying huawei phone but dont know which is better se or se is better
Huawei,nova 7 SE,funny the specs says launched in april but the next line says status discontinued huh its discontinued because huawei does not have any kirin processors anymore due to the us ban they are not able to acquire the materialsparts needed to make more
Huawei,nova 7 SE,it seems that most of the commenters not aware that huawei does not allow google play and serv more still very excellent phoneand ready so far petal search have been helpful for internet browsing and huawei appstore didnt dissapoint if it doesnt hurt to use such phone with minimum google service theres no reason to not go for it have been using this phone about days now and the gaming experience is very satisfying
Huawei,nova 7 SE,nova or se which is better especially camera the nova is way better overall
Huawei,nova 7 SE,which is better huawei nova or nova se nova of course better processors and specs
Huawei,nova 7 SE,think nova se is the better for you thank youwill be getting the todayhope its worth it

Huawei,nova 7 SE,im planning to buy huawei phone but need to know which is better phone se or huawei nova se better chip camera and battery
Huawei,nova 7 SE,very goodbut havequsis huawei nova se waterproof
Huawei,nova 7 SE,not bad specs are great the problem is most phones for android users are supported by google but huawei phones are not anymore having hard time figuring out to access all google supported apps vmos works but it is still kinda separated from your os phone
Huawei,nova 7 SE,cant even use google play google docs etc no youtube how do downloaf or make more go to your home screen then type google or any app you want to download on the search icon
Huawei,nova 7 SE,just buy day the camera wide angle had problem you can get replacement or they will repair for free with warranty contact huawei service center
Huawei,nova 7 SE,why the nova se no nfc didnt see it anywhere that it said nfc is there
Huawei,nova 7 SE,can somebody please tell me every single problem in this phone and whether should buy it or not bought the european version of the se called lite as second phone on preorder in june used it for some time then swapped it with my wife for her lite nova which currently use as my daily phone both are comparable the se is more premium than the lite with glass back has slightly better processor with capability bigger main camera sensor and larger screen but it has slightly smaller battery mah had no issues whatsoever with the lite nova se except for its glass back which may have been at risk of damage given my site visits and rough handling of the phone apart from what had mentioned above it seems that the version always gets the latest updates ahead of the nong version this might be coincidence though summary as long as you are not entangled into the google environment go for it the se is comparable with the flagship in its performance looks and build but for some reason has better battery lifetime
Huawei,nova 7 SE,download the shopee apps from huawei apps gallery but it keeps accidentally closed what sho more thats weird maybe contact huawei there is support app in that go for live chat or just call them
Huawei,nova 7 SE,for using youtube check out this httpsconsumerhuaweicomaeencommunitydetailshowtouseyoutubeoryoutubevancedonhmsdevicestopicid

Huawei,nova 7 SE,any phone with glass back will shatter if dropped at the right angleposition if more dropping phone is normal who does not drop phone accidentally if there are people who never drop their phone they are superhero if youre not superhero then you shouldnt have this phone
Huawei,nova 7 SE,huawei nova se is not worth it to buy my sister bought one few weeks ago it has shockpr more any phone with glass back will shatter if dropped at the right angleposition if youre the person who drops things then go for phone with plastic back or use good case shatterproof cases usually protect the edges not the back
Huawei,nova 7 SE,hi may anyone review on its gps im hardcore huawei user ever since and got phon more regularly use herewego and tomtom both work fine havent had any complaints at all also google maps works fine from the browser gps is fine

Huawei,nova 7 SE,owned this phone recently about days ago what fellt about this phone gaming no problem at highultra little warm for hours gaming quite good lol some version of other branded phones already hot at cpu after minutes gaming at ultra my phone version are universal unlocked rooted abit cheap from standard version its original huawei but rooted by factory unlocked can use global simcard easy install apk formating settings certain tweak for pro user modding apk gaming if you want faster storage loading get faster writespeed micro sd like sandisk brand fast charging overall at entry level this phone win at many level for simple user like me battery full charge around below minutes for camera good no lagging can capture fast without posing to hard hehe love the presettings of this phone easy to manage anyway thats all btw nova almost coming by end of this year maybe this phone will get cheaper by next year trust me android phone always drop price like crazy around years used
Huawei,nova 7 SE,im going to tell you to buy the nova the chip is an older flagship little better than more hi thanks for your answer actually am thinking of picking the mainly due to its faster chip whats causing me the dilemma is that can get either of the phones at the same planprice via recontracting from my service provider and knowing that the nova se much more expensive than the right now is whats preventing me from getting the dont actually think much about the gms thing so thats why want to know if the se has really good cameras then ill go get it then thanks again
Huawei,nova 7 SE,ppl hv diff preferences but prefer quality lcd over dire amoled me too
Huawei,nova 7 SE,saved so many progress on my games on my google account but really want this phone can more huawei does have their own app store huawei appgallery like apple got their apple appstore if you cant find the games you need in appgallery just go to apkpure and you will find all games you need pubg ml cod etc for google account you can add your gmail account in mail app of the phone so it will connect to your games same procedure with other devices bought nova se for my wife who plays pubg lot and no problem im even jealous so planning to buy one for myself too hope this helps
Huawei,nova 7 SE,for me amoled screen is deal breaker im done with screen burn amoled is not reliable in long term im glad that huawei still put lcds in their phones got few samsung phones before with amoled screen and got screen burn after months my wife got samsung note and had screen replacement twice because of screen burn after the warranty she couldnt request for reparation anymore so she deal with it since then now bought her nova se and shes really happy with it she doesnt want amoled screen ever so those whos craving for amoled screen yes its bit better but definitely not reliable spend your money wisely
Huawei,nova 7 SE,which is better amoled or lcd amoled is far better
Huawei,nova 7 SE,well it is ltps lcd which is better than ips lcd huawei mostly doesnt use amoled for its more which is better amoled or lcd
Huawei,nova 7 SE,after days of use notice every time make video call and last about minutes that back camera heats up hope it will resolve after some update

Huawei,nova 8 5G,its nice phone if it can have google service itll be perfect
Huawei,nova 8 5G,love huaweis mobiles the most quality huawei is the best
Huawei,nova 8 5G,is it sold in africa
Huawei,nova 8 5G,no worth buying this phone its really disappointing it should has had at least more nova has mah and it even last day of usage huawei has great battery optimization battery life still depends on ur daily usage and apps ur usingno matter how big ur battery capacity is as long ur using all time then wont last day
Huawei,nova 8 5G,great phone with low pruce tag smooth ui dont care about google anyway
Huawei,nova 8 5G,its disaster no google service avg camera no stabilization and only gb capacity ill recommend vivo in the similar price
Huawei,nova 8 5G,without sd card slot and no google play services its useless deal
Huawei,nova 8 5G,unfortunately we dont have the and kirin version of nova in the philippines
Huawei,nova 8 5G,good phone the only downside is the battery capacity with big screen
Huawei,nova 8 5G,same as huawei nova the diff is the battery and the price check and compare them with nova
Huawei,nova 8 5G,huawei egypt will sell this phone over priced please monitor egypt branch thanks like how
Huawei,nova 8 5G,this is great huawei is just on another level in tech
Huawei,nova 8 5G,waiting for the full review first
Huawei,nova 8 5G,wifi abgnac and ax
Huawei,nova 8 5G,emui isnt bad at all you just need to try it and youll eventually get used to it more im sure it is really smooth and optimized just dont like the way it looksbit too cartoony looking for me
Huawei,nova 8 5G,how is this stupidly priced for bucks cant get better deal than this ac wifi more emui isnt bad at all you just need to try it and youll eventually get used to it it works perfectly normal and looks clean people freaking complain about mah while huawei phones and really aggressive on battery saving so that they deal with background apps and other power consumption things the only problem is the lack of google services but you could sideload google
Huawei,nova 8 5G,indeed people ignore the fact that this is powered by flagship chipset
Huawei,nova 8 5G,deleted post look dude there are people that like bt get over it
Huawei,nova 8 5G,deleted post see you in the comments of almost every phone without mm jack
Huawei,nova 8 5G,if huawei keeps launching really stupidly priced phone for such specs than its going to be ri more how is this stupidly priced for bucks cant get better deal than this ac wifi mah battery video hz display gb ram kirin nm up to gb of storage fast charging ud fingerprint sensor cant get better than this except the ui is bad so then just slap custom rom in it and boom problem solved
Huawei,nova 8 5G,any one tell me what is build quality corning gorilla glass is it please huawei no clear what is build plastic no gorilla
Huawei,nova 8 5G,think in this price range it is beast and processor is blazing fast
Huawei,nova 8 5G,huwei phone is very good handset with fast recharging battery and good internet browser and find camera and love it
Huawei,nova 8 5G,good answer xiaomis range is from to mm
Huawei,nova 8 5G,mah seriously bro dont read only the capacity of the battery just see the actual size of the phone especially the thickness for example almost all new phones released by xiaomi have big battery capacity but the size of the phone is so big thick and also heavy why do we need to carry heavy phone while we already have super fast charging process on today standard
Huawei,nova 8 5G,battery capacity is low but the charging potential of is high means your phone wont last day but it will fully charged only for mins or less still good phone
Huawei,nova 8 5G,battery too low yeah bro
Huawei,nova 8 5G,hertz display and mah
Huawei,nova 8 5G,so the only major differences between this and the nova are the hz refresh rate screen and charging rate sadly huawei has ditched the telephoto camera not sure if would consider this phone especially for someone like me who never really care much about super quick screen refresh rate and super fast charging rate
Huawei,nova 8 5G,the nova pro has mah battery yeah but the nova pro is bigger and has hz display
Huawei,nova 8 5G,disagree the high refresh rate coupled with will eat up battery life very very quickly more against high rr and it has nm chipsetw fast chargingoled panel and good battery life optimizationso dont think users will face seious battery life problemdepending on you iphone has no battery life
Huawei,nova 8 5G,it has fast charge and battery life is more depend on optimization disagree the high refresh rate coupled with will eat up battery life very very quickly mah should be the minimim if the handset has and high refresh rate people will have to disable these features in order to prolong the battery life which defeats the purpose as you have to compromise and restrict the experience in exchange for battery the fast charge is great but it is known fact that fast charging lessens the battery charge hold quicker then conventional charging
Huawei,nova 8 5G,just mah battery and where is telephoto lens this is downgrade from nova so no need to more it has fast charge and battery life is more depend on optimization
Huawei,nova 8 5G,no telephoto camera and enormous punchhole on the display why
Huawei,nova 8 5G,this phone needs to drop in south africa because theres always trouble
Huawei,nova 8 5G,no need im happy with my
Huawei,nova 8 5G,hey guys look more dumb depth and macro cameras
Huawei,nova 8 5G,why the battery is too small no audio jack no sd disappointed thats huawei for you
Huawei,nova 8 5G,decent and nice phone
Huawei,nova 8 5G,no ois camara
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,no more google love huawei without google good keepit up harmonyos is better than andriod
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,the name says this phone is only but the chipset is panik gb ram kalm android in more lol
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,dont buy phone that doesnt have google support no matter how good the looks more have many games but theyre connected on an email of the game company not google play games simple and quick solution and gaming on desktop is just better mostly keep my phone for calls texts which any huawei even with harmonyos can do
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,not that good tbh why
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,how good is the harmony os not that good tbh
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,install google play services on your huawei phone using googlefier download and install the googlefier app launch googlefier grant the app the permissions it requires follow the instructions on the screen the app will then replace the existing backup app and restore lzplay sign into your google account when prompted
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,dont know why bigger phone with small battery why not mah or mah why mah my man there is always difference bw big small phones used redmi note with mah battery yet its performance is not up to that of huawei nova that used had to revert to the nova which enjoy more than those with bigger batteries despite the nova having just mah capacity so keep cool huawei is always better
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,google is still working in huwaei phones
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,huawei is doing like apple iphones using same battery for every device coming back since more yes you are right
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,does it have haptic motor yes very good one
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,operating system android emui no google play services
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,not supported dual operating systems this phone nova pro android harmony
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,google play store available with this playstore services available
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,now huawei is replacing android with harmonyos
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,lovely phone camera quality best ever speed super secured
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,looks good but specifications are not interested good price
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,for wireless network joint project in that project the us will invest billion us dollars while japan will invest billion us dollars furthermore both companies are approaching australia to join this project
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,like how it says the phone is but it says the processor is
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,both love and hate that huge camera hump and hate the fact that both love and hate it love it because it looks very cool the camera hump design has bold convincing character and therefore the large hump feels justified unlike some other phones but hate it because at the end of the day huge camera humps are still awful than having no large and thick hump at all and by hump mean the big rectangular shape that surrounds the cameras
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,tephoto cams are slowly disappearing in midrange and higher midrange and dont like
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 4G,ugly notch why tho isnt it so simple to make it look good
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,nfc support in this mobile
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,is it compatible with wireless charging no
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,karat gold with diamonds as buttons
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,should not be about eur
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,is it available in the philippines
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,their is wireless charging for this mobil
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,why huawei have only mah battery in their mid range phones they dont need more my huawei phone has mah and it easily last full day of medium use its in my country and have left with the medium power saving mode
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,why no telephoto previous model nova pro has optical zoom
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,total downgrade from series come on huawei you guys should start offering better specs cam more yeah they just traded the periscope camera for hz
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,unfortunatelyhuawei doesnt only get cut off from gms but anything made with some of th more they have harmony os which yeah still install apps without gms
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,had nova plus the same year it was launched and must say it was obsolete on arrival especially for the price
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,beautiful design but no mm jack no card slot the charge is harsh on battery life and it should have only one selfie cam
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,whats up with the wide selfie camera come on huawei know you are better than this
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,this really represent the theres phone in my camera
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,so the mate is their best of the best top of the line phone the is their best camera techo more it is designed specially for youths so it is more capaple in graphibs for gaming and stuffs like that
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,god what is this this is design gore right here specs are good but its design looks like speaker shoved in phone
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,you can jailbreak it and install gms if you really need that pretty easy and lot of tutoria more can you send me the youtube link which jailbreak the phone
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,is this available in ph already if not when will they release this phone in ph and hm thanks
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,not sure if its an upgrade over the series practically the same chipset bigger more like this mobile
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,so you expect me to hold the phone for hours to talk and how would listen to the song or wa more get mp player technology is revolutionizing
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,yeop yep
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,like huawei devices but the nova pro is very expensive no googl play services and only more the battery is not short thats one huaweis is so agressive on apps running in the backround and people dont give attention that it powered by the flagship kirin its beast but yeah its price is too high it should be maximum and definitely we wont ignore that it has the little useless mp macro and depth
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,the petal maps app seem nice im trying out huawei services with my old plite but it seems to be far from covering what apps can deliver
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,will we see google services returning to huawei someday its complete pain that it doesnt su more you can jailbreak it and install gms if you really need that pretty easy and lot of tutorial on youtube
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,bands and ca
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,phones without headphone jack or sdcard slots are useless would pay dollars max for more not everyone needs headphone jack or microsd there are other needs people want in phone not just yours
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,can also consider lg thinq or sony xperia is too heavy otherwise would have bought that and is the one am considering now xperia ii is good but the issue is that it has headphone jack on the top which am not liking much and also sony phones are not sold in my country lets see if comes with good specs and less than in weight ideally around in weight
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,camera setup not matching except others should be ssquired no to be circular
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,yes will buy that only not getting stock at the moment but it is available on singapore so more can also consider lg thinq or sony xperia
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,then get an or who is stopping yes will buy that only not getting stock at the moment but it is available on singapore so once travel is resumed will buy one also these companies are making phones with mm jack with low specs which means there is no reason for no giving that in their high end phones but to make people fool they dont do it
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,why should buy low level specs phone without anything good can always buy or and more then get an or who is stopping
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,then ur only option is budget phone deal with it why should buy low level specs phone without anything good can always buy or and can also build or order customised one for myself too which will cost much lesser than cost of apple or samsung high end phones are not more than which are sold at
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,no one is anyway buying huawei due to no play store and google map etc and on top of that th more then ur only option is budget phone deal with it
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,bt phones are not future it is for fools who do not have any idea how bad they are not only more alright alright chill
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,bro this is era of earbuds and bluetooth headphones bro this is the era of fools in my view who has no ides what they are getting after spending only fools can buy these things surely not for me dont use earhones which goes into earcanal and earbud will not stay in my ear even for few min so who will keep buying them by spending that too for poor sound quality which has no match of mm earphones
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,bluetooth headphones are the future for consumer headphones dont use consumer bluetoo more no was just trying to show him that its not as bad of move to remove it as it seems
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,the mp primary camera looks like an old nokiachina phones with symbian os in my childhood it now looks bad on these phones and the technology is like going back iam thinking why these phones put small size cameras back and now putting large size cameras which where already exist before and this may not be innovation
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,is it two sim supported gg
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,really really like this phone but the chipset and the cameras
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,the best mp camera
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,traditional lithiumion battery inside standard smartphone takes an average of about minutes and the time shrinks depending on the chargers speed on the other hand battery with graphine cell is much faster and full charge of mah battery takes about minutes with charging brick in terms of lifespan most of the batteries can manage around and charge cycles but real graphene batteries can last about cycles for the same capacity and because the cell generates much less heat which helps to run your smartphone cooler and safer
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,but thought it was for dollars the price is changed
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,the specs are good but mah is small for inches display and the phone is bit pricey more look at the thickness of this phone not as thick and heavy as xiaomi latest phones which has more than mah as you said think huawei put nova series as stylish phone it is slim and beautiful for enthusiast user there are and mate series remember this phone can be charged to at minutes and at minutes
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,this phones screen would be incredible according to this spec sheet the battery and cameras seem little underwhelming
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,at first sight the camera housing looks pleasant and hints for premium camera system in reality you get no ois the usual and even the mp ultrawide garbage sensors
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,the bigger the battery the better
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,oh nothe spec is highbut the batteryoh noat least pls the software optimization of huawei is know for battery and camera so dont you worry even if its mah its gonna last you day bro
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,no difference between this and nova pro would prefer the pro cause of the telephoto lens fast charging bt hz these ones are the outstanding difference
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,such scheme no have google
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,no mm jack no card slot no iprating no glass protection no thanks
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,mp ultrawide in my opinion they could have put mp one the rest of the specs are ok except the battery
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,full charging time min wow its really good
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,no audio jack no sd card small battery what fool next
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,tbh dont like the design of the camera bump and using kirin is fine but its more but still good chip
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,idk why everyone is this much hyped up for this phone with the buckle style camera module on more maybe this says something about you btw we all have different taste dont like it too but
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,mean the kirin performs better than the in benchmarks so it should be pretty fine price is different know price compare with sd and
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,okay next january or will want
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,you all must touch and see this phone directly this phone looks really cool also with its unusual camera feels different than the render images
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,loading google play or harmony os will put mm jack into the mobile dont think it more why do you even need headphone jack
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,waiting for nove tomorrow to be announced be ready
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,just load google play services or wait for harmonyos loading google play or harmony os will put mm jack into the mobile dont think it will change any hardware the phone is useless without mm jack
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,no mm jack what fool they are no one is anyway buying these without google outside chi more just load google play services or wait for harmonyos
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,cant speak for everyone but im saying if people are ok with snapdragon chips they more if those people are ok with the and sensible people arent
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,im fine with isnt everyones fine with cant speak for everyone but im saying if people are ok with snapdragon chips they should be fine with this like the vivo pro they had great camera for the money and this has great display for the money as well
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,probably its good phone but with no google services cant live have huawei media pad it is running an old version of android and emmu so got google services youtube app google play huawei gonna dies with no google
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,nice design
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,camera design looks like mi lol
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,snapdragon is slightly worse than kirin im fine with the so shouldnt be more im fine with isnt everyones fine with
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,the design and specs is amazing but no google service eeeeeem will pass this one
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,no point to buy this phone
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,missing audio jack sd card google service no thanks next please
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,its going to be usd wow well the specs are great just dont have gms too bad its bit expensive think without the gms
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,great phone if it is like bucks its going to be usd
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,outdated soc literally makes this as slow as redmi the redmi is fast for the pric more snapdragon is slightly worse than kirin im fine with the so shouldnt be too bad
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,this phone does seem very promisingif the price is right would say that if the price is under its good deal even though it doesnt have any kind of google play services and live in the usa think can go without it as long as can download most things with apks etc
Huawei,nova 8 Pro 5G,that camera housing was totally bigger than ive ever expecting
Huawei,nova 8,the all users of this phone smells like quesadilla with anchoas yes it is
Huawei,nova 8,nova battery last really long probably its chipset is good at saving power who knows true the kirin
Huawei,nova 8,not impressed with the battery capacity this absolutely not for the heavy users nova battery last really long probably its chipset is good at saving power who knows
Huawei,nova 8,after months still no major upgrades no emui no harmony os compatibility for global version just monthly security patch the phone is good though such shame
Huawei,nova 8,my phone last night was charged as but when woke up was totally shutdown and cant turned on bought it years ago
Huawei,nova 8,year review must to say im surprised when bought this phone was pretty sure battery gonna be bother me but table turned and battery amazed me im the heavy user and this phore still can hold up day without any problem dont know why this mah battery can do that much maybe because of ui or the hms but im not sure at the end that super charger going strong im just need to plug in for or min max and then im ready to go about camera its decent in good lighting and do his job alright can give it get ready for top notch topic hmsgms part so got to say at the first hms bother me but after couple months find so many ways to have my apps and app gallery grown month by month and for now dont care about gms anymore hope this review has helped you
Huawei,nova 8,guys tell methe private space can use diiferent simcard from the one on my main space all your sim from main space are active in private space you can receive calls from all sims in private space but you can create second whatsapp in private space using second sim whatsapp messages from private space wont appear in main space dont use same sim for whatsapp in main and private space
Huawei,nova 8,if youre into long gaming without requiring the high ultra quality this could be good phone doesnt heat up like other flagship killer wannabe its light and its comfortable to hold for long gaming hours cores doesnt really matter it only matters if youre lazy af
Huawei,nova 8,lol another stupid comment xiaomi has the worst ui in the world so it must get or more youre absolutely right bro
Huawei,nova 8,why pay for battery keep your and buy poco is more butter lol another stupid comment xiaomi has the worst ui in the world so it must get or mah battery for regular performance but huawei or google or apple dont need huge battery
Huawei,nova 8,wait hexa core what seems like we have got back to yeah features upgrade but engine downgrade maybe they focus on heating failure
Huawei,nova 8,think use harmony os is better than google play
Huawei,nova 8,mah for regular phone in what joke
Huawei,nova 8,wonder why they dont include the nova se lohas edition with same processor has connectivity overall the specs are good but meh wish they dont remove the connectivity on this one
Huawei,nova 8,overpriced phone if someone give me this phone will sell it immediately and bought one that is more impressive in the same price range
Huawei,nova 8,wow thats quite price to pay euros thats cheap for good phone
Huawei,nova 8,dont see the worth of investment in this phone nothing special but the fast charging which isnt that impressive to most people
Huawei,nova 8,wow very cool device but euros is quite hefty price to pay for it
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,poco pro base model is around euros with powerful snapdragon processor google mobi more without custom rom huawei phone are very handy caped people definitely shouldnt buy there phones have no idea why they hold any value at all they should of lost most there value and been dirt cheap
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,buy this phone if you want to keep the peace of staying away from social media no play store more facebook twitter etc none google related stuff can still be downloaded installed from their huawei appstore
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,can this thing usse google play services
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,kirin used in phone of mah with outdated cpu megapixel camera that more poco pro base model is around euros with powerful snapdragon processor google mobile services better screen with middle punch hole like the galaxy fast charging mah battery capacity sincerely dont see the benefits of using phone that comes with bloatware only and no google services huawei phones prices has skyrocketed since the huaweigoogle clash and paying for non gms phone that doesnt allow you to install lineage android custom rom is useless please huawei you should stop making mobile phones because it doesnt make sense even buying nokia or samsung android go phone would make sense theyre not only cheap but also receive major os upgrades by their manufacturers
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,both sims or only one dual dual standby is there band mhz is more my friend this phone have not
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,its not like they cant make better midrange soc for their phones ones they choos more oh please no id rather have them stop production than incorporate crappynos socs on their phones
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,the only pity is that there is no fullyfledged dualsim solution instead hybrid slot was used this is bad and dont buy

Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,wooowow cortex and how old is this thing cant blame huawei right now they have to rely on their own older manufacturing technology thanks to the us ban although im not fan of this brand its sad to see it literally disappear from the competition because of ban
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,in this phone harmony os is global or china only global gets emui with hms which is basically the same
Huawei,nova 8 SE 4G,overpriced garbage with small battery no sd card headphone jack

Huawei,nova 8 SE,they might just be troll whether they were or not people that think smartphones cant work without gms are unfortunately real and dead serious about not buying huawei because they think apps cant work properly on them
Huawei,nova 8 SE,when huawei remove than ban and come with google service depends if joe biden wants to play the economic game fair or not
Huawei,nova 8 SE,agreed sub mah cannot possibly last long well still beats the iphones guess well am thinking the same better tahn apple

Huawei,nova 8 SE,nova better than this have it perfect phone with perfect price
Huawei,nova 8 SE,hello huawei im looking for huawei to buy instead of xiaomi no bezels good cpu go more maybe on paper the xiaomi looks better honestly dont own this model but have xiaomi redmi note and sincerely regret that bought it because the phone is not very good the wifi connection is constantly interrupted so have to reconnect often and update for applications is very rare while android is factory and to this day have not received any support or upgrade but with my huawei it is the opposite and much better and applications are updated daily and factory android came to android no lag good battery good performanceso advise you to choose huawei
Huawei,nova 8 SE,no google no purchase im tired of spamming this link to every expert that hates on huawei even though google search can fix his problem so here httpswwwxdadeveloperscomgooglefiereasilyinstallgmshuaweihonordevicesamp or simply google this googlefier download xda

Huawei,nova 8 SE,hopefully if joe biden will win the us election the google will resume to huawei no more bann more im hoping that would happen
Huawei,nova 8 SE,the battery capacity was so high it should be mah or mah
Huawei,nova 8 SE,ita punch hole camera no it has notch
Huawei,nova 8 SE,no stereo speakers
Huawei,nova 8 SE,the nova se had punch hole camera why this one has notch centered punch hole camera would have been better
Huawei,nova 8 SE,almost still got mah battery lmao
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,my comment is that were find that phone
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,that no google play services is trash hahaha yeah sure stick with your apple or galaxy device
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,am big fan of harmony os and so cant miss this
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,mk jul is this phone good no
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,this phone is very beautiful but dont know why you still use kirin this should be dollars at most this design should go with an upper midrange chipset
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,is this some sort of joke android with no google play services when android will soon more all of what said is accurate except for the fact thta honor is separate from huawei now and honor launched this deviceit wasnt launched when huawei owned honor so blame honor not huawei
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,honor se with downgraded camera soc
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,and for euro dont know who would think even about this phone maybe if the pric more true
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,stone age lol dark ages
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,please dont buy this phone this phone processor is old go put it against maybe like sn more compared to this processor is double the power
Huawei,nova 8 SE Youth,cpu is the same power as snapdragon even less powerful so this phobe ia not worth it
Huawei,nova 8i,worst phone ever bought huawei nova years ago and nothing is fixed after lets more he is so wrong this phone is amazing
Huawei,nova 8i,worst phone to buy its slacks in all departments regret buying it
Huawei,nova 8i,have owned huawei nova for almost years now all can say is that this phone is such an amazing phone captured lot of moments using the camera the photos and video quality are good and decent but the only thing that makes me regret buying this is the expandable memory even though at first knew that it had no expandable memory still bought it hahahaah in the nature of my work it was highly necessary for me to take pictures or videos as part of the documentation or report we needed to submit this past week have also noticed that the camera is having hard time clicking the camera button
Huawei,nova 8i,the most pathetic phone ever you cannot download google play you cannot us your old apps it more have all the google apps on mi incl google play store so dont know where you coming from with this statement download gbox on your huawei app store then download all your google apps on gbox
Huawei,nova 8i,very worst phone dont buy they are cheated me this phone not support any banking app more did you miss the part about no google play services and even then you can sideload gms to make play store apps work but in my case we made request to our banks to put up app gallery versions and they did
Huawei,nova 8i,huawei nova is twin of honor lite phone think it is possible to install magic ui more have try it but somehow it will need you to enter to edl mode which this phone wont soo meaning doesnt work
Huawei,nova 8i,this is true because no technology is perfect whatever fault any user would have found in any more yes all my nova is used for is paper weight because it suddenly got virus from apk app and wiped everything
Huawei,nova 8i,people be reviewing phones without owning them it throws me off or maybe just maybe they have references on the internet from people who actually owned phones just like how you do not need to own pixels to know they overheat since youtuber and other social media exist
Huawei,nova 8i,one things ive learned about reviews people always has something bad to say about any pr more this is true because no technology is perfect whatever fault any user would have found in any phone or gadget is not because they complain but it is because it is their experience it is helpful to consumers so when buying phone they already know what will they expect when using it and if they think the issue some users find troublesome might be tolerable for others if you cant understand that then dont read reviews and go posting impetuous comments
Huawei,nova 8i,nokia with more appealing design
Huawei,nova 8i,shame no google play store on this model otherwise may have been decent emergency second phone
Huawei,nova 8i,owned the phone for almost years now very durable phone the quality is of high standard camera quality is great would recommend it to anyone dropped this phone on couple of occasions and it seems to structed efficiently and is very strong and at the same time very elegant love the back of the phone with the quad cameras and the high shine of the back glass
Huawei,nova 8i,can install honor lite firmware on nova someone please help
Huawei,nova 8i,isthe phone water resistant no it doesnt have ip rating
Huawei,nova 8i,has this issue been resolved no

Huawei,nova 8i,yesterday got this phoneissue is that the phn show one imei numberi insert sim card but only one sim is activei am confused does this phons have single sim variant
Huawei,nova 8i,has this phone for the past months so far so good battery life is reliable the processing speed is fast for mid range device and the built quality is outstanding proper multitasking abilities can not complain my recommendation is you must consider this device amongst competitors
Huawei,nova 8i,had this phone for around months now and its awesome never had any problems on it its fast more isthe phone water resistant
Huawei,nova 8i,very disappointing in this device camera very slow call quality is very bad operating system crashes and restarts would not recommend this device
Huawei,nova 8i,we regret buying this system due to the lag and slow camera hope you could fix this its really dissapointing
Huawei,nova 8i,it is publicly known all over the world for quite some time that huawei dont have google ser more correct
Huawei,nova 8i,switched from nova to nova bcuz of broken screen worst decision ever back camera is very bad and blury the phone is very slow the only positive is the bigger screen and slightly better colours got back to fixing my after months
Huawei,nova 8i,is this runs google account as it is compared to plite
Huawei,nova 8i,sd is way more powerful than sdg and sddo your research httpsnanoreviewnetensoccomparequalcommsnapdragongvsqualcommsnapdragon here is my research
Huawei,nova 8i,worst phone ever when bought it no one told me that google services are not supported more you dont do any research before you buy one if you dont know id like to make clear with you almost none of huawei mobiles doesnt support google related services like xiaomis china version unlike huawei chinas xiaomi has two versions global and china versions global version has google related services but china version doesnt so if you want to use google related services buy the other brands like xiaomi global version oppo samsung etc if youre okay even if you cant use google related services you can buy any kind of brands including huawei ps forgot to say that next time you buy new mobile phone check out its specifications first if necessary do deeper research
Huawei,nova 8i,lol sold this phone had for months to my brother for less than half the price and upgraded to iphone se with chip best decision ever made im glad sold it im never buying huawei again
Huawei,nova 8i,this phone frustrates me so bad wanna crynothing in this phone is integrated have appl more man its like you wanted on iphone to play something thats not apple products reading comments do you ppl do little research when giving money for something min for some review and thats all you need to know to play fortnite on the mobile phone my last huawei was smart and was fast like lightening fast like wifes iphone openingclosings apps in second and it was under
Huawei,nova 8i,am the only one experiencing very low loudspeaker volume even if its maxed up when receiving calls specially with fb messenger is there any way to fix this
Huawei,nova 8i,just like you have tons and tons of reasons why anyone should not bother with this phone more no the phone has good quality camera battery and screen only problem is the older processor but its has very smooth ui have it and upgraded to iphone se the huawei is my secondary phone
Huawei,nova 8i,the nova is the most useless phone have ever bought with my money it has this tendency more my sentiments no more huaweigoing back to samsung
Huawei,nova 8i,almost all the comments about this phone is negative but most of the comments are false and lie friend of mine owns this phone and can tell that it perform absolutely well compare to all this rubbish reviews it has better front selfie camera than my samsung it is not sluggish like samsung and perform better guys shouldnt be dis biased when it comes to other brand reviews
Huawei,nova 8i,terrible phone had it since end march months restarts itself at least once day for no reason finger print reader not very sensitive operating system very slow no google
Huawei,nova 8i,can we put harmony os to this phone
Huawei,nova 8i,it doesnt have google service very bad phone ever brought the nova was far better than novai
Huawei,nova 8i,waste of moneystarted freezing just two weeks after bought ittook it back only for them to say there is nothing we can nowmonth now it switches itself off whenever it wantpoorest camera ive ever got on phone
Huawei,nova 8i,sometimes feels bit sluggish to load aps other than an in bright light the camera will take blury poor quality photos even indoors with good lighting there are work arounds for the lack of google services but they can be annoying due to adds you can pay extra to remove ads apart from those issues its decent phone
Huawei,nova 8i,was so excited when bought this phone followed by many regrets afterwards what waste of money and time just did to myself overrated for nothing in fact that phone should not had been manufactured at the first place just sold it to colleague months after buying it with so many nightmares with it downgraded to oppo as and it it far way better than this so called nova
Huawei,nova 8i,please dont waiste your money in this phone very bad camera not supporting lot of apps upgrade software very bad
Huawei,nova 8i,dont let anyone tell you that the nova is bad phone to me its the best phone more had this phone it is really sluggish the battery life is not that good and the fast charger is cool but the overall experience is really disappointing had it and changed it within month went to the plus its major upgrade at cheaper price
Huawei,nova 8i,its processing speed is slow has very bad camera which takes forever to get focus dont waste your money
Huawei,nova 8i,can you send me about more details of huawie base in your experience its very bad camera and cant update whatsapp and other google apps its required permission and more complications its not use and friendly dont buy
Huawei,nova 8i,very bad camera photo shaking and blurred really waste of money not supporting other google applications
Huawei,nova 8i,is it water resistant
Huawei,nova 8i,thinking of buying this phone any advice or warnings it doesnt have google service
Huawei,nova 8i,please add the sampling rate of the devices
Huawei,nova 8i,my cousin got this yesterday its like my redmi but wout gms and much better camera not that use camera much
Huawei,nova 8i,america have completely destroyed huawei mobile company by stopping google services for them rip nova
Huawei,nova 8i,im experiencing microphone problem with my huawei nova people who call me can more the speaker volume while on call is not so loud so annoying
Huawei,nova 8i,im also not happy with this phone mic is not working
Huawei,nova 8i,waste of money cant even take photos anymore everytime want to take photo of something and want to look at the photo just took the photo just vanishes
Huawei,nova 8i,so me and friend both bought the and she accidentally sat on the phone and broke the top camera we tried to see if the lense was affected none so my question is does it have four lenses or just one and whats the function of the other cause when you cover them only one gets affected also over heats even the huawi honor is way better than the phone
Huawei,nova 8i,as huawei fanboy can say never buy this phone it sucks really sucks get nova inst more regret buying this phone
Huawei,nova 8i,no memory card slot and slow for the signal also must prefer that samsung was decieved
Huawei,nova 8i,ram cant be slow use the nova very fast and reliable the you have is fast because of its faster and power efficient nm chipset the nova chip be nm bro so poor and downgrade
Huawei,nova 8i,singlesim card only mine is dual sim in the philippine market
Huawei,nova 8i,by saying that motorola phones are equipped with googles stock android you have indicat more open source everyone has access to the source code and can develop all kinds of malicious applications disguised as legitimate applications android stock no thirdparty uis added over the original android uis full of adware spyware popups banners etc like emui miui color funtouch etc and that do nothing but waste unnecessary phone resources think again
Huawei,nova 8i,hello can someone guide me im not mobile gamer need mobile for my daily use more dont know what your budget is but motorola phones have the advantage of being equipped with the stock version of android directly from google no bloatware no spyware no adware or other such mess motorola edge with gb ram rom and mah battery or motorrola edge pro with gb ram rom and mah battery both have oled both have snapdragon both have hdr both have refresh rate of hz both have ecent main camera with an mpx sensor motorola edge not the pro model is bit better in terms of internet modem and wifi module compared to its older brother edge pro the edge has wifie modem at mhz while the edge pro model has wifi modem at only mhz on the other hand motorola are known to be bit lazy when it comes to updates which are offered every months
Huawei,nova 8i,another new old phone from huawei with an year hardware like ips lcd snapdragon cpu nm in no no gyroeis only no nfc without google package and for which huawei requires about euro in the same money there are alternatives such as xiaomi mi lite with amoled hdr hz snapdragon nm kfps gyroeis dust and splash protection bitkhz audio and access to the google package
Huawei,nova 8i,the gig version is actually smooth and fast if you superfast downloads etc then activate your developer options by tapping on the the build number multiple times then go to carrier aggregation and activate it what it does is takes two or more lte signals at the same time giving you gigabit speeds same like fun fact actually does the same thing research it
Huawei,nova 8i,still android in the cheaper oppo nokia and the samsung galaxy as are already being shipped with android out of the box have huawei prime this maybe my last huawei device because its the last huawei which was shipped with google mobile services
Huawei,nova 8i,thought mah was the standard for however still appreciate the fact that huawei samsung motorola vivo oppo nokia redmi tecno give some decent full hd ips panel ips lcd technology is considered as dinosaur in the tech world but surely the most reliable screen technology ever could watch an ips lcd panel for hours without having eye strain im not gamer and dont watch full length movies on mobile so amoled isnt necessity for me
Huawei,nova 8i,mah is standard for thought mah was the standard for
Huawei,nova 8i,dont really like the selfie camera part if compare the selfie camera of my oppo that way better compare to nova screen size is an advantage just dont like the selfie camera am not sooo happy with this phone

Huawei,nova 8i,you are right its not ugly its fugly one word boycott ha ive been theres new device
Huawei,nova 8i,no sdcard slot no google play is this some kind of joke from huawei are you just no google play
Huawei,nova 8i,this one is gonna be huawei lite mark my words this ones gonna be one of the huaweis last phones mark my words
Huawei,nova 8i,the price its the most nonlogical thing on this phone it packs with cheap hardware with android but not and theres no google service for it either and at the price point can instead buy another used exflagship phone or even new cheap midrange phone
Huawei,nova 8i,huawei should definitely change the name of this from nova to something like nova lite or some new name you cant put and be inferior to the guess huawei is in its final days so if this continues xiaomi is the answer
Huawei,nova 8i,this is really sick yes not approved for flagship cause ips lcd and sd
Huawei,nova 8i,no google
Huawei,nova 8i,huawei will had the same nokia ending huawei phone prices are too exorbitant xiaomi remains the best it provides quality with affordable price
Huawei,nova 8i,really big fall samsung in most of the phones used exynos lower than sd more xiaomi is the option
Huawei,nova 8i,demm nova is better with nm why nm recycle defect cpu
Huawei,nova 8i,since this is malaysiaspecific phone last years nova with kirin chipset and more nokia doesnt have megapixels sensor doesnt have fast charge doesnt have even fhd resolution nokia screen to body ratio nova nokia has lower bluetooth version nokia doesnt have gb ram
Huawei,nova 8i,not just no google using sd for nova after using kirin in novai can call th more really big fall samsung in most of the phones used exynos lower than sd compare to sd or even lower like as now realme in realme pro realme pro realme pro did same movement using sdg should mention samsung just recently start using sdjust in two models amore than but huawei now rings round all other makers from kirin to sd
Huawei,nova 8i,soon all companies remove sd slot and mm on entry level smarphones xiaomi is already doing it on their upper midrange phones with the mi lite so it really is just matter of time will never embrace wireless audio and cloud storage ever again thats for sure already grew tired of living with them and dont want to do it again
Huawei,nova 8i,no google play not just no google using sd for nova after using kirin in novai can call this fall kirin its comparable with sd sdif factor ability they so close to each other also in this range of proccessors just sd sdthey have better performance than kirin
Huawei,nova 8i,seriously sd
Huawei,nova 8i,are you kidding me huawei snapdragon hate this phone huawei nova got powerfu more who at all gonna buy this phone with spec like those
Huawei,nova 8i,huawei has all the amazing trump card of being able to produce their own socs and what do they do with this trash use godawful snapdragon
Huawei,nova 8i,only sd just suck at this price range
Huawei,nova 8i,think nothing is impressive about this phone
Huawei,nova 8i,snapdragon on lol huawei need to shut it down
Huawei,nova 8i,no you are right its not ugly its fugly one word boycott
Huawei,nova 8i,for the same price you can get poco pro with flagship level not like this weak soc here
Huawei,nova 8i,looks ugly no
Huawei,nova 8i,why not harmony os
Huawei,nova 8i,willing try another huawei but with its kirin chipset am so satisfied with its mid range chipset bcos its just feels like sd top end chipset in my experience
Huawei,nova 8i,what jokemy dollar phone have better chipset than this
Huawei,nova 8i,no micro sd card or nm card and only gb internal useless for me
Huawei,nova 9,have nova and really like curve screen is nice feel like premium phone and night photo is good but not too good quality image battery is small but watching youtube and daily app is can use with single fully charge audio is loud but not good sound quality google is ban on this phone so have to some tricky to used google app and the most like thing is my huawei nova is not hot so why some people say it hot with lacking water resistant and stereo speakers otherwise its good phone recommend it
Huawei,nova 9,excellent phone regarding performance screen and cameras fast charge also no cons except you find it tricky to handle google supported apps recommend it but if you have google app you cant live without then samsung and oppo will be good
Huawei,nova 9,have just bought my new huawei nova everything else is good the only challenge have is more maybe power saving mode would solve your problem
Huawei,nova 9,bro each huawei phone with snapdragon chipset have heating issue qualcomms fault
Huawei,nova 9,sorry friend but almost all parts of samsung are manufactured in china think what he meant was chinese brands
Huawei,nova 9,okish display what is good display for you hz superduperamoledplus with nits this more theres nothing flagshipgrade about this display nits of maximum brightness is fairly low even for upper midrange devices its not manufactured using cuttingedge material ee nor technology like ltpo not to mention that the colour accuracy seems to be also quite mediocre
Huawei,nova 9,okish display classaverage battery life and performance soso camera but the mono speake more okish display what is good display for you hz superduperamoledplus with nits this display is flagship grade
Huawei,nova 9,have simple rule in life dont buy chinese phones happy with my samsung sorry friend but almost all parts of samsung are manufactured in china
Huawei,nova 9,have bought nova week ago live in lithuania and in that region you dont get case in the box thats not good because needed to buy the case and wait for days was scared of dropping it because the screen is curved after all the phone is very great and couldnt find better device for that kind of money eur the main camera is great but all the others are poo poo garbage have come from mi main camera is better in nova but liked the ultra wide camera on mi so much recommend this phone
Huawei,nova 9,after buying this mobile am really disappointed it is not user friendly at all important more kinda agree gspace is trash and should include more apps but the phone on the other hand is good it was expensive at launch but bought mine week ago for eur you can find one for easily
Huawei,nova 9,have still huawei nova of it had google services and let me tell you with and ram still is contender for most new middle range phones and belive nova is practically same
Huawei,nova 9,have huawei nova as my daily phone and have complaints about it not having playstore is not an issue had all app that wanted camera is and performance is great love the design small battery but can last me full day because of emui
Huawei,nova 9,for it was terrible value but for probably gives the most premium experience hardware and ui best display and best camera
Huawei,nova 9,bulbulitobayagbag dec because releasing phone outside of china without gms is junk even you use gspace it will la more buy phone that has gms bought two phones nova se and pro planning to upgrade to nova now if you thinks its junk then dont buy it no one is forcing you to
Huawei,nova 9,ive got my nova on my second day of using it keep powering off even im using fo more thats because it uses snapdragon chipset
Huawei,nova 9,why does gmsarena insists on lingering on the topic of gms cant they digest the fact th more because releasing phone outside of china without gms is junk even you use gspace it will lag based on my experience not worth the trouble really and they are selling these at very high price its junk
Huawei,nova 9,bulbulitobayagbag nov yeah the honor is better nova however if you read the review just recently posted more one thing you forgot honor magic ui is really rushed and the camera is far better on the nova have no idea why gsmarena says thee camera performance is underwhelming while of the reviewer say its among the best camera phones for the price
Huawei,nova 9,guys using since weeks wonderful mobile just use once then comment
Huawei,nova 9,there are still lot of people who care about huawei outside of china and who dont wann more thats right
Huawei,nova 9,for anyone wondering huawei had started preorder for nova since th nov to th nov with price of myr usd eu in malaysia this is the gbgb variant its similar priced with the recently launched honor gbgb in malaysia the preorder comes with huawei freebuds pro that costs around myr usd eu if you havent check out huawei freebuds pro yet heres review httpswwwgsmarenacomhuaweifreebudsproearphonesreviewnewsphp think its good buy if do the math the price end up to be myr usd eu only
Huawei,nova 9,the background blur in the photos look so artificial badly simulated
Huawei,nova 9,miui fixes all that and many xiaomi users here have said come on xiaomi just launch mi and mi note pro
Huawei,nova 9,was waiting for this smartphone from very long what an amazing camera design along with back more if you have read the review to the end the beauty of the noca is unfortunately only skindeep isnt honor better choice since it has same design and has gms
Huawei,nova 9,better everything not really yeah that phone is stupid cheap but dimensity wont be more since when in history that huawei give regular updates even when huawei phones have gms the update regularity was like once every months at best miui is not that good with update regularity either but having gms is already big plus for lot of users
Huawei,nova 9,spoiler no fps on video recording
Huawei,nova 9,yes thats what you think but really the best is the xiaomi note pro although the mi more miui fixes all that and many xiaomi users here have said
Huawei,nova 9,for the first time since november huawei phone review is back btw mi lite ne is be more yes thats what you think but really the best is the xiaomi note pro although the mi ultra is the best but xiaomi has to fix miui because lately its been problematic
Huawei,nova 9,wow camera performance is terrible never expected that from huawei phone in just get their mate pro for competitive camera quality even in
Huawei,nova 9,for half the price youll be able to get the xiaomi redmi note pro with better everyth more better everything not really yeah that phone is stupid cheap but dimensity wont be enough to have good photos out of mp lens its selfie camera is much worse and good luck living with miui and those certainly regular software updates all that being said huawei always releases nova phones at higher prices then takes them down for whatever reason check out how nova ruled over the upper midrange category in this phone would easily do the same if it was to go down little on price
Huawei,nova 9,nova ts msrp was just like this one at launch they just release the phone with high more right
Huawei,nova 9,nobody in their right mind no huawei are doomed outside asia im from italy and have huawei lite no needle of google no needle of apple
Huawei,nova 9,just wonder whose idea was to price this euros in my country can buy moto edg more nova ts msrp was just like this one at launch they just release the phone with high price then make massive price cut to make it seem like its really good deal when thats its actual price
Huawei,nova 9,poor useless useless
Huawei,nova 9,no gms no talk
Huawei,nova 9,got to say details in binned mode looks better than most of competitors including samsung sony could be different fov but did not went into so much detail
Huawei,nova 9,even samsung as trashes this phone for significantly cheaper price no screen protectionno ipno stereo speakersno google no ois for this asking price seriously huawei
Huawei,nova 9,the reviewer compared this phone to xiaomi offerings they are both very similar phones with brighter displays more powerful socs have ingress protection boast stereo speakers and are better photographers too seriously he should have stopped there if xiaomi products are sold in your region there is no reason to get this huawei phone that lengthy verdict very sorry to say is unnecessary also whats with that glaring ooca branding
Huawei,nova 9,ridiculous pricing just like all their new models just go away honor youre superfluous
Huawei,nova 9,people still buy huawei phones now the company is finished the sanctions are staying yes people still buy huawei phones the only thing holding them back are the lack of components and foundry for their kirin chipset its just matter of time until they sort that all out us sanctions are lame
Huawei,nova 9,interesting alternative to the honor with gms good phone for those who dont want google would be even better if they swapped out the snapdragon chipset for something else
Huawei,nova 9,thats poor battery life for the battery size less power hungry chip
Huawei,nova 9,still using the nova should say its better in all aspects except the screen refresh rate doesnt matter anyway to me
Huawei,nova 9,this has imxy but does horror photos huawei just should follow lg and quit they more it doesnt have the imxy most likely an omnivision ryyb sensor like on the honor dont think sony is even permitted to supply customized sensors to huawei anymore unless they get special licence
Huawei,nova 9,this is imxy not this is why it is mm dont think so think its an omnivision sensor the honor used mp ryyb from omnivision its probably that one chinese media reported that the sensor is inches which would match the omnivision one if it was the imxy they would definitely advertise it
Huawei,nova 9,this phone and the pro is master piece but the pro is only exclusive to china huawei nova and nova pro is too expensive as the nova pro the money can buy you vivo pro and oneplus pro in aliexpress definitely not worth it
Huawei,nova 9,the photos taken by this phone is breathtaking the foliage is outstanding better than iphone samsung or pixel mean just look at those main camera samples
Huawei,nova 9,what is this
Huawei,nova 9,this is nova series
Huawei,nova 9,where are tha macro shots
Huawei,nova 9,not worth it also for all huawei users would suggest using aperture mode for bokeh shots if you dont care about beauty and blur effects cause aperture shots are little sharper and can change blur strenght and also change focus after shots
Huawei,nova 9,if lacks google services is con why isnt that the case on iphone that is cos you can still download those apps from the app store unlike the case of huawei
Huawei,nova 9,huawei dont even use sony sensors for their pro because of us restrictions which me more this is imxy not this is why it is mm
Huawei,nova 9,no google services no audio jack no sd card very small battery life huawei no more garbage phone please
Huawei,nova 9,its so stupid to buy huawei phones anywhere outside china
Huawei,nova 9,didnt expect it to be that dissapointing looked merely good in paper though what woult you expect even the nova series isnt thta bad now that its quite cheap
Huawei,nova 9,flagship design and display for less is nova but still poco mi realme gt and even samsungs are better
Huawei,nova 9,huawei just stop trying to sell crappy phones outside of china so called macro and depth cameras are just waste of space you have to search apps in different search engines unlike every competitor this phone has worst user experience in the market
Huawei,nova 9,could someone who has nova try this there is guy that has taken an app called ohinfo httpswwwcoolapkcomapkcomyrickyohinfo that is supposedly used to check the openharmony version the open source version of harmonyos he says that he managed to transfer this app to nova which till now some android info apps such as geekbench state that it has android underneath now according to what he says if this ohinfo app shows something on nova then the phone is running harmony os if it doesnt then nova is on android or or whatever so before everything else he also installed this app to nova which we all know has android on nova the ohinfo app showed nothing meaning that nova is not running on harmonyos but on android when running this ohinfo app on nova it showed nova emui is based in openharmony he concludes that emui that will be pushed to all global devices will thus be harmonyos but not the same version that is running on chinese devices more likely lighter version httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvblkxlkqo
Huawei,nova 9,it looks good and that video stabilization is awsome thats it to manny flaws for this price range
Huawei,nova 9,didnt expect the camera to be unexceptional
Huawei,nova 9,change country origin to taiwan on huawei app then update your phone at the app itself dont more wonderful that they let you do this in my country novas is more expensive than nova which can be had for around then see one for se for and the novas is too hehe but the has the same cpu ram etc as the they most likely dont know the update to harmonyos is possible
Huawei,nova 9,was anyone able to upgrade to emui or harmony os does it support emui
Huawei,nova 9,yes updated it to harmony
Huawei,nova 9,my nova is running harmony os and received nov patches great phone running very nicely how did you manage to upgrade
Huawei,nova 9,sep bro cant even play codm on it its just keep crashing everytime try to play it it works on mine the thing is if install it using gspace it would crash but if install the apk directly on the phone it works perfectly
Huawei,nova 9,have converted my phone to chinese harmonyos using service by ministryofsolutions and the more you are the ministryofsolutions
Huawei,nova 9,does it work in india
Huawei,nova 9,really good phone even in its sad cant update to harmonyos why at in china
Huawei,nova 9,maybe try to set singapore or hong kong in region appgallery and on settings will the banking apps and all other important stuff work properly then
Huawei,nova 9,my last update was september security patch nothing else after that maybe try to set singapore or hong kong in region appgallery and on settings
Huawei,nova 9,is anyone else stuck on emui my nova is stuck on emui cerp yes the same situation stuck in emui no sign of update tot emui so lame from huawei give us update before christmas please
Huawei,nova 9,this phone even from can compete against samsung ultra and realme pro on taking more there is video on youtube that takes you through installing google mobile services on emui with microg
Huawei,nova 9,how to fix about this phone crashing aps and games haist
Huawei,nova 9,until now the camera is so nice and clear and take note video front and rear camera so smooth and proudly says that can live without google it is small detox for me
Huawei,nova 9,do not buy this phone if you are gamer because you will be disappointed because whenever more bro cant even play codm on it its just keep crashing everytime try to play it
Huawei,nova 9,the nova literally has everything that the se has and more storage was mainly the reason why opted for the se the gb nova se costs as much as the gb nova
Huawei,nova 9,if gaming is what the user is looking for then yes the adreno on the nova is better th more the nova literally has everything that the se has and more
Huawei,nova 9,have no problem with it still am using with no problem userfailure may be matters
Huawei,nova 9,so guys have been using this phone for year its great phone it has very good performance but the battery is not that good it doesnt last full day with moderate usage and if you plan on gaming the phone will overheat very quickly and will be very hot the doesnt matter honestly miss it but the signal is rather good gms is easily installable but has ads but you can pay for no ads although it doesnt bother me so overall good phone if you can find it at the right price and display is beatiful but the camera is horrible for night photo taking
Huawei,nova 9,dont believe for sec there pure lies am posting this now with my huawei nova more nova has no heat issues nova is great phone with no lags its an upper midranger
Huawei,nova 9,touts very good camera however recording long videos on it is impossible because the phone overheats if you use the camera for too long the phone comes with builtin function to disable all apps once it overheats so your video recording will be cut short abruptly really stupid if you watch video for too long it will overheat if you play game with hd graphics it will overheat whats the point of phone with excellent graphics if the prolonged use of those graphics will render that phone incapable of functioning the phone cools down fairly quickly but that doesnt mean much when your phone shuts down every time you decide to use it actively
Huawei,nova 9,is worth to change my smart for nova yep better display better battery and more powerful soc the camera performance is also better too so yes use nova
Huawei,nova 9,why those camera doesnt work and stil have yp still camera doesnt work
Huawei,nova 9,nova have adreno gpu nova se have adreno gpu thats sht gpu if gaming is what the user is looking for then yes the adreno on the nova is better than the adreno on the nova se the nova is an upper midranger with better soc specs however for user looking for an allaround experience probably with less gaming the novase is the choice
Huawei,nova 9,somebody help me nova se or nova se or honor xa which one better can tell you about the nova se and the nova se since have both nova se also called lite is great phone albeit years old still feels and responses as new phone it has the kirin with support if interested in screen is good hz ips lcd gb and gb ram depending on the market good battery with mah and charging it shoots and plays youtube clips at up to resolution if im not carrying the this one is my daily driver nova se fabulous looks great hz oled screen fabulous colors and very recent release has the snapdragon which is the only limitation of the phone gb and gb ram very good mah battery with charging it shoots and plays youtube clips at up to believe this is where sd shows inferiority to kirin although love the se if im buying now ill go for the nova se the two phones are at least years apart if you dont need video shooting go for the se imo honor is not on par with huawei from the quality pov
Huawei,nova 9,is huawei nova still worth it in yes
Huawei,nova 9,it has sony imx sensor but camera takes very bad pictures for high specs so got rid of itgot sharp aquos sense plus instead and pictures are so clear in comparissonindoors night time so noticable
Huawei,nova 9,is okay to switch to this nova from my as beacuse dont like the oneui and know that more is not worth to upgrade from as to nova because the phones has similar performacne
Huawei,nova 9,before im using nexus love that phone thou after using and half years it bootlo more how can install gms
Huawei,nova 9,iphone nova
Huawei,nova 9,good device but too big for me
Huawei,nova 9,just got my nova last january th and ive encountered lot of issues already the bat more you need to adjust your screen frame rating if its working on or fs constantly it wont only drain the battery fast it will damage it as well
Huawei,nova 9,im using nova bougth it weeks ago ang im xperiencing over heating while im not using it dont know close all the running apps go to sleep my nova is percent battery life when woke up it turns percent and over heating
Huawei,nova 9,had one not great sold it and got the asus rog phone mine sometimes froze whilst doing lo more dont believe for sec there pure lies am posting this now with my huawei nova the device is really fast no lags good camera besides can use type headphones or earpiece and also type otg flash with the phone the phone is worth the price google apps can get with gspace the os is really clean no unnecessary ads what more do want from phone
Huawei,nova 9,honor has bad camera did you forget about the performance the exynos is so subpar that it makes the as way better pick just because of the sdg
Huawei,nova 9,its the worst huawei phone ive used besides the cam nothing else
Huawei,nova 9,slow video calls stops every seconds for one second losing voice also phone is total rubb more am using huawie nova for months did not experience all those comments you made it run smoothly
Huawei,nova 9,hi how did you convert your phone to chinese harmony used paid service from ministry of solutions just search in google
Huawei,nova 9,lol im using this for months an no issue at all stop spreading nonsense will you unless if ur huawei nova se userlike it has so many issues except for no gms
Huawei,nova 9,base on comment here most of negative comment said about no gms no and another nonsense more thanks for sharing your experience helped me lot
Huawei,nova 9,hi its easy to get all apps in your huawei device download gspace in more yeah already did
Huawei,nova 9,bulbulitobayagbag aug id like to think of huawei now as just like apple when you buy an iphone it comes with more hi its easy to get all apps in your huawei device download gspace in appgallery log in with your google account and download all your must need apps
Huawei,nova 9,the galaxy is better pick gms water resistance pretty good cameras and os updates more honor has bad camera
Huawei,nova 9,that alone should convince you but perhaps dont use it in china same goes for android phones with gsm elsewhere
Huawei,nova 9,whitch one is best huawei nova or samsung and why the galaxy is better pick gms water resistance pretty good cameras and os updates pretty good ui and support the nova wins in its build quality but if you decide to go with nova try to find the honor instead same phone but with google and support
Huawei,nova 9,nova or novat would not recommend either tbh nova is missing gms and nova is and old phone instead of nova or try to find the honor if you cant find one recommend other brands like oppo realme or samsung they have gms have frequent updates android skin is pretty good and offer low cost devices like samsungs and oppos line of phones
Huawei,nova 9,the good thing about the new huawei phones is that their prices decrease lot in short time more id like to think of huawei now as just like apple when you buy an iphone it comes with ios and no google apps installed apple has their own appstore where you can find google apps with huawei you can find it at their appgallery
Huawei,nova 9,after neearly week usage would say even this is one of the cheapest verson of huawei phones you cant really feel the difference between this and top class phones had before find xpro google pro find and now bit short so bought this and just perform the same as the others had to realise soend or even more on phone is just insane and make no sense at all unless money doesnt matter for you
Huawei,nova 9,go for the honor it has google apps the honor is good but also look at other devices more we all know that honor is just copy cut of huawei the difference is that they separate company so honor will have google
Huawei,nova 9,bought yesterday my nova nd hand paid for months old phone since yesterday ive managed to download all google app what used on my previous devicesapart grom my banking app
Huawei,nova 9,hows the gaming of this phone am planning to purchase this device
Huawei,nova 9,instead of thinking about getting the nova would instead recommend looking for honor more also the honor it has radio bands and better screen believe it or not
Huawei,nova 9,and your point is according to statcountercom at the end of february mobile op more always recommend the honor phones over huaweis nowadays but want to point out that in the global market they released emui instead of harmony os also emui and harmony os are still based on android so there is possibility that the stat includes them both in the android number still with this dont think the marketshare will be huge most average people already moved from huawei to another brand by now
Huawei,nova 9,bla bla bla bla bla who cares usa spy most by trying to claim world power more ummmm yes they will get beat they already got beat huawei usersthat use huawei phones without gms nowadays are just minority of what it once was when phones had gms without google most people dont want to buy huawei its just fact one of my friends who is average consumer got lite and got rid of it in less than moths because of the lack of google during and days everyone talked about huawei in the global tech community but if you look at it now they barely talk about huawei its sad becouse huawei was big innovator in phone cameras and etc but its just what it is still love huawei phones even without gms emui is the only android skin enjoy using but most people want google
Huawei,nova 9,wich one should buy and why nova or avg tk instead of thinking about getting the nova would instead recommend looking for honor its the same as nova but with google services
Huawei,nova 9,guys need help im looking for phone and im used to huawei dont need more the phone itself is pretty good but it depends if you need google services if you need google apps stay away from this phone better to get xiaomi realme or samsung if you can live without google that includes youtube app this phone is pretty nice also if you want the nova but with google services you can get the honor same phone but with google
Huawei,nova 9,got my nova week now it has good camera but cant edit reels on instagram its petal clip has bugs too
Huawei,nova 9,nova or as pls need quick answer if you want then go for samsung as but for the camera and performance id say nova if youre worry about not getting gms on the nova there is gspace which is available to install from huaweis own appgallery im using my nova for three months now so far so good im really adjusted with their ecosystem
Huawei,nova 9,im using this phone for four months first days bought of this phone underwent some experimental functions for some apps so can identify which apps that requires gms or not around works without gms but most of it requires google firebase notifications to work with certain apps so thats why installed microg if the app is gms heavy then theres gspace you can download the app from the app gallery
Huawei,nova 9,im torn between nova and samsung fe can you give me some recommendations whats the ca more of course you should go with the samsung
Huawei,nova 9,if sometimes in the future huawei is allowed for use is this phone will get unlocked more maybe they will release case to use just like pro httpsmgsmarenacomthehuaweipprocangaingconnectivityviaaspecialcasewithanesimnewsphp
Huawei,nova 9,had both trust me only huawei samsung
Huawei,nova 9,great phone upgraded from the progot the nova at good price love the high refresh rate the display the processor is very fast too battery life is very goodcamera is pretty good too its bit of hassle to transfer all the data from phone with google but its worth it
Huawei,nova 9,snapdragon phhhhffft
Huawei,nova 9,my nova has green tint and it can not show clear photo or video with black in it you either have defectie unit and can take it for warranty or you just broke the screen
Huawei,nova 9,no doubt huawei is still better quality build regardless of google am using this its very slim and very smooth touch and camera result is far far better than xiaomi or any other so called hype brands
Huawei,nova 9,honestly overpriced like the crazy it doesnt worth more than even if you are fanboy more sso you want midrange phone for budget price ok got it
Huawei,nova 9,no stereo speaker no buy
Huawei,nova 9,very very good phone build quality amazing screen amazing chipset right what need very fast charging and os emui is very smooth and responsive go huawei
Huawei,nova 9,no radio no earpiece is the only thing see that is very bad about the phone because cant enjoy music with earpiece and is very bad
Huawei,nova 9,but qualitywise wired music is so much better than wireless as for msd slot its more ill give you that micro sd would be useful but if you cared about audio quality you would get an external mm not talking about an adapter
Huawei,nova 9,bruh mi true wireless basic cost why do you want mm also you are plenty and more but qualitywise wired music is so much better than wireless as for msd slot its just for flexibility yeah you can get big internal but it will take so long to transfer the data because not everyone has gigabit internet connection
Huawei,nova 9,considerably terrible specs laughable camera and weak soc for the price rather pay less can you believe it and get which outmatches this handset on every level what is huawei smoking lately
Huawei,nova 9,huawei does not make anymore huawei made that is in the past good phones that could compe more bla bla bla bla bla who cares usa spy most by trying to claim world power and really appreciate how huawei made sure they survived without them do really think google os or apple os will beat hos when it comes to global bet you know
Huawei,nova 9,if gsm is back on huawei phone samsung will sink only their flag ship line will be sold but the lower end phone no way huawei is putting emphasis on their design so nice
Huawei,nova 9,bought this phone recently and am satisfied with my purchase camera is great even in snapc more thats because huawei and snapchat are pretty close and snapchat optimizes camera for huawei
Huawei,nova 9,love all the features as well as photo quality took my first one back to telkom the glen because it overheats when use the video for longer then minutes as well as the maps add got replacement and it does the same thing im impressed with the vlog feature but dont like that it overheats and have to wait for it to cool off
Huawei,nova 9,how are you finding the lack of google services is it something that you knew about
Huawei,nova 9,wanted this phone but reading all those negative comments had doubts whether to buy it or more because this is not the only phone at this price category that offer almost everything that you mentioned which are minuses with this huawei nova then why dont you pick something that has non of these issue that you mentioned picking this smartphone doesnt mean someone must use more head than the others
Huawei,nova 9,no whatsapp think
Huawei,nova 9,google is connected to your fb acc even in games acc they are all connected to google google will tract your everyday activity do you think your browsing is secured no its not even your simcard your messages your calls can be tract
Huawei,nova 9,you can laugh all you want but it wont bring huawei back to life of course it wont huawei is basically dead thanks to america just dont think for second google and meta wont spy on you any less we are moving it to future were our date is the product and the scary part is that we cant change it also give time to honor to catch up huawei will be kind of revived
Huawei,nova 9,thanks really need good laugh today you can laugh all you want but it wont bring huawei back to life
Huawei,nova 9,fb and google dont spy on anyone they dont have to because theyre not some more thanks really need good laugh today
Huawei,nova 9,really think they always spy on users whats wrong with youare you working in intelligence agenciesor are you government secret service
Huawei,nova 9,no no google play services no card slot no radio no mm jack just like iphone they havent it too
Huawei,nova 9,no it is not worth upgrading from nova to this nova you are practically giving up more thank you for your insights shall keep that in mind
Huawei,nova 9,is this worth for upgrade ive been using nova and still superb phone after yea more no it is not worth upgrading from nova to this nova you are practically giving up technology which is the future in mobile telecommunications for technology which from certain points of view is starting to become slightly obsolete that is many equipment manufacturers and telecom operators leave the development of in the background and focus more and more on from my point of view the transition from nova to this nova is downgrade rather than an upgrade personally own lite which is basically built on the nova platform more precisely nova se and am not at all attracted to give it up in favor of this nova
Huawei,nova 9,yeah just like all the american tech companies spies on their clients like facebook google more fb and google dont spy on anyone they dont have to because theyre not some commies who want to watch and control everyone and regardless if you did something or not spying is illegal would you say its ok if someone broke into your house but its ok because you dont keep anything valuable for them to steal
Huawei,nova 9,no you should blame the chinese government for trying to spy on us they did the right thing more yeah just like all the american tech companies spies on their clients like facebook googleif you have nothing to hide why concern over it is kind of hypothetical defence mechanism by the so called western dwellers
Huawei,nova 9,phone isnt that bad probably if they upgraded the chipset ko sd that would be better
Huawei,nova 9,no google apps think thats the biggest thing for me im using too google maps is the smallest issue for huawei phones powered by hms in the huawei app store there are petal maps and tomtom which manages to replace google maps quite well the main problem for these phones is the lack of google security certificates which makes most applications in the area of banking epayment ewallet etc nonfunctional
Huawei,nova 9,about euros for phone only without the google package without the jack without the fm radio without the memory card without the stereo speaker is enormous ok this nova also has some strengths but if we put the pros and cons of this product together you dont have to be an expert to come to the conclusion that its not worth it for the same amount of money you can find alternatives that have all the above huawei no longer produces anything in terms of mobile phones and fans of the brand should resign themselves to the idea even the companys ceo has publicly stated that from top manufacturer in the world their target has become survival
Huawei,nova 9,think theres no problem in using chinese brand phone the only problem is that china is stealing some important invention even technology they used it to study to make their country on top and they starting to control the world economy and this is big problem
Huawei,nova 9,fantastic design powerful fast charge light and thick bit display hz ryyb sensor an more display main camera rest cameras network design price conclusionnot to buy
Huawei,nova 9,blame the us for no and google service no you should blame the chinese government for trying to spy on us they did the right thing by banning huawei and the next step should be to ban all the other chinese brands like oneplus and xiaomi its time to move on to samsung or apple
Huawei,nova 9,come on huawei no blame the us for no and google service
Huawei,nova 9,does have nova plastic or glass back frome site to site is different story about spec
Huawei,nova 9,low cpu clockspeed
Huawei,nova 9,also not available everywhere yet gms not problem you are lazy no micro sd just get more
Huawei,nova 9,very nice phone for its price wifi check hz oled display check super fast charging check ryyb camera check harmony os not so much on global but as far as can see emui has most of the best features of harmony os and will work like charm in huawei ecosystem which is by far best ecosystem after apple also if you know your gadget gms is not even problem there are plenty of better alternatives for any google app cant wait to get my hands on this device
Huawei,nova 9,still xiaomi mi lite is better choice and cheaper nova has better display same soc faster charging better battery life more polished ui far superior camera and as long you dont need its an amazing all arounder yes at this point dont think the gms situation is problem for the average educated consumer
Huawei,nova 9,superb phone for the price range
Huawei,nova 9,its not about that at all posting opinion doesnt make you child offending people more when people only can complain constantly why they even want to repeat all this instead of finding another phone see those coment for years in here now they dont give somthing to the discussion at all enough must be enough if those people want to change something they should post their opinions the right place some home siteforum etc where this brand host the site you and cant help them just find phone which fits me even could scream every day because no one release proper inch ratio or inch ratio phone
Huawei,nova 9,let me say some things in rdworld countries you are not rich to buy or chnage smartphone eve more oneplus rt is not available globally
Huawei,nova 9,why so many people feel for wasting the time on phone they dont want sounds like childr more its not about that at all posting opinion doesnt make you child offending people makes you something worse you should respect to people not their opinions or atleast dont insult to people dont know how old you are people dont be like that
Huawei,nova 9,wonder who said removing memory card slots made phone cool bruh did you even read their comment
Huawei,nova 9,for most of the people who commented here its better to get some knowledge about current situation of huawei after us ban than wasting time here by crying
Huawei,nova 9,for that price theres way too many better phones
Huawei,nova 9,no mm jack no sd card slot and the cameras other than the main one seem to be bad theres no excuse for removing the jack from this phone it is not foldable phone or anything like that its just big slab bt headphones and earphones still have worse audio compared to wired ones also they dont last as long as wired ones because the battery dies in few years they are more expansive too and theres the laglatency too which makes most wireless earphones unusable for gaming wired ones do not have this problem
Huawei,nova 9,man really hope huaweis situation gets better they made quite competitive phone but the thing is that it doesnt have google apps and services and no at this price so its no for me or wouldve bought it
Huawei,nova 9,snapdragon whatttt is that true no you need to be updated huawei cannot use chips because of the usa ban
Huawei,nova 9,no google and no on this price go kill yourself huawei
Huawei,nova 9,very disappointedno harmony os in global version
Huawei,nova 9,how can cope with smart phones without sd card slots and inbuit radio am finding it it so more microsd to usbc adapter spotify
Huawei,nova 9,well no headphone jack no it is no by me as well
Huawei,nova 9,its literally so much better wtf if you buy budget phone aint getting good wired headpho more you know people own headphones they dont have to use the ones in the box shocking right wireless audio is still subpar and limited in many ways which is why chose the zenfone as it has headphone jack this phone here seems okay at best unfortunately too much is missing or just not on par with the competition for that price
Huawei,nova 9,its because of the sound quality best wireless headphones are not close to wired qual more if you want the best audio unless you have the lg you should get an external headphone driver
Huawei,nova 9,overpriced garbage no sd card no audio jack no gapps small battery no more trash phone please
Huawei,nova 9,still dont understand why people complain about the headphone jack when gaming tws are super cheap its because of the sound quality best wireless headphones are not close to wired quality for gamers it is not important but for the ones listening to music is
Huawei,nova 9,not everyone is into wireless headset its literally so much better wtf if you buy budget phone aint getting good wired headphones anyway
Huawei,nova 9,no
Huawei,nova 9,yeah or those the point is that you can get decent tws for cheap still dont understand why people complain about the headphone jack when gaming tws are super cheap
Huawei,nova 9,no mm no sd funny agree will never buy phone without headphone jack and card slot changed five usb headphone adapters suspect they made to not last also have over cd and like to rip them to flac and have them on my phone now have an lg gx and and im happy it also has quad dac for better sound also tried bluetooth headphones but usually they have bad sound and thers delay so cant use them for gaming
Huawei,nova 9,xiaomi headphones are trash get mpow mbit or edifier they usually cost dollars more yeah or those the point is that you can get decent tws for cheap
Huawei,nova 9,why not your name told everything lol
Huawei,nova 9,no they dont but actually there are loads of ways to use gms in huawei phones now there are but there isnt any guarantee that google apps will work normally since huawei locks bootloader and doesnt give anyone possibility for unlocking you can only use some shady ways to get google play services on the device that means apps can stop working at any time and they wont pass safetynet test meaning you can forget on using google pay and some banking apps
Huawei,nova 9,is huawei have googleit isa good phone want to know if it has google it doesnt but you can live without google
Huawei,nova 9,no their is no google services for all upcoming hwaei devices no they dont but actually there are loads of ways to use gms in huawei phones now
Huawei,nova 9,it dosent have nor amoled and its priced at oled and amoled are same samsung define oled with am so call amoled they are same type and different nameother oled are poleddynamic amoledthey are all oled not lcd

Huawei,nova 9 Pro,lacks google mobile services
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,does novo pro has google app
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,best phone the world company huawei pretty overpriced at this price get poco sd instead of better camera bigger battery google servieces youll compromise charging and an ultrawide selfie camera but the poco is an overall better phone and its bucks cheaper
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,hope future nova series phones will have telephoto lens again nova was the last to have this feature
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,any google services
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,wifi
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,nova is waste product nova are good nova is the best
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,huawei from the day they got banned they have big problem with android updates own lite they dont update the device they dont offer updates in the future so no support huawei will die slowly outside china
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,we want to hearing from huawei model nova device high light dual operating sys more this is good phone but wish it was available globally instead of only in china
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,what can do when need that phone
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,yeah its because of the fast charging yes but the charging speeds are different also its mas not mas
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,lol nova has mah and nova pro has only mah yeah its because of the fast charging
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,nova pro is cute and perfect for ng huawei phones are solid even my old nova
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,holly molly nice phone for nice price
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,absolutely agree with what you said people say huawei violate privacy bla bla bla more thank you for summing up this perfectly people just tend to focus on the east for privacy concern but completely forgot the west set the standard for privacy issues google and facebook are the biggest culprits the only reason people worry about huawei is because the us felt china was starting to take its business changing the global power dynamic huawei has lot to lose and no one has proven to the public that huawei is risk you have large risk using facebook than huawei phone im talking from experience have used iphone samsung and huawei mate pro switched to the mate pro best decision of my life am happy degoogling my life and its been amazing so gms means nothing to me using hms is fine for me if you have used huawei with hms then you can comment if you have never then you points to this comment with have no merit as you dont know what you are talking about
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,must use huawei phone no matter what so do
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,all new phones that huawei makes come without google play services also there are no indicat more donc czre
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,no band no google play store no wifi and no watts charging no new own processor kirin no camera megapixel no dual operating systems android and harmony too hard for huawei phone huawei nova pro and huawei pro
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,is the charger included in the box
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,lock bootloader dont care no google services havent tried but think can more there is no true privacy anymore dude privacy is not something that you feel we all traded our privacy for something
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,remember guys huawei locks the bootloader and it has no google services and has bad history more lock bootloader dont care no google services havent tried but think can live without google bad history with privacy give an example ive used huawei phones but dont think my privacy been violated in any way
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,no no wifi and no watts charging no new processor too hard for huawei
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,im definitely interested in this latest os
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,why huawei phone not launching india as huge followers or this please try to lauch in india
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,is this have google play services no
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,ois it is doesnt have ois and telephoto mi or pro with doesnt have too do you remember lumia that phone had ois even with zeiss optics back in the and price tag of and ois is not that expensive or complex tech you just need to put it
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,have you ever use huawei thats pointless question
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,still regardless of fault that doesnt change the fact that many of us are tied into and more just go check how many rdegoogle post there are although hav egot used to spygle spygle spies almost as much as facebookkno one can beat facebook despite that there are plenty of alternatives to google and even ios would be an option
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,its not thier fault and its not like cant live without google and downl more still regardless of fault that doesnt change the fact that many of us are tied into and like the google set of tools without that option huawei which used to use is definate no go
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,honor and huawei will crack the screen in bend or drop low quality phone just check jerryrig more exactly especially the mate which jerryrigewerything saw how incompral it is is your brain connect whit your body
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,and pro have times more limited availability than this plus im pretty sure more it looks like this midranger is better than older flagship
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,but for that money can buy maybe even pro and pro have times more limited availability than this plus im pretty sure is slightly more expensive
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,the nova pro has better camera sensormp one idk which one but think its imx more but for that money can buy maybe even pro
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,that charging speed is terrific huawei already has watts coming soon maybe nova
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,it maybe happen someday and its better to have protection isnt like gorilla glass and ip rati more st even with gorilla glass ur phone is going to get cracked or scratchedbasically plastic or glass nd jerryrigeverthing does not do drop tests which are most common way of breaking phone rd ip rating is useless as if get your phone submerged and only have ip for example ur gonna get it damaged but even with ip phone survives for specific amount of time th no brand covers water damage warranty
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,bruh not everyone bends the rphone and drops it plus of the time people slap on more it maybe happen someday and its better to have protection isnt like gorilla glass and ip rating dont see this phone have it or gsmarena didnt know
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,galaxy is better the only downside is the soc and capabilities are in ur brain ur comparing euro phone to or euro phone so see no point how is better unless ur sammy fanboy
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,most pathetic thing is huawei dont have google play services its not thier fault and its not like cant live without google and download some apps on apkpure amazon appstore etc etc its us fault tho
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,its not necessary that huawei will provide only that things which xiaomi offers huawei more have you ever use huawei
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,yup think nova pro with cheaper is better choice than pro sd is hitting honor and huawei will crack the screen in bend or drop low quality phone just check jerryrigeverything
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,ridiculous pro phone with trash specs next
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,interesting screen resolution thats huawei trying to be android apple
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,the aspect ratio on nova is taller yes and although prefer taller guess most eople want more yup think nova pro with cheaper is better choice than pro sd is hitting
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,look at res pro is hz and it is hz the aspect ratio on nova is taller yes and although prefer taller guess most eople want taller phone
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,lets wait for the battery test but what about lacking of ois isnt it xiaomi thi more ois it is doesnt have ois and telephoto mi or pro with doesnt have too
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,ma battery is for xiaomi phones not huaweigoogle or apple cause they have better ui or more lets wait for the battery test but what about lacking of ois isnt it xiaomi thing what why all the phones should have curved screens
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,which phones exactly has mm jack or sd card you cant find phone above that ha more httpswwwgsmarenacomresultsphpnyearminnpriceminchkmmselectednorder you are so wrong and dont say any one something that you are quality on jack is far better than wireless and im backing up my sensitive files on sd card
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,newer honor pro but downgraded honor pro
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,overpriced without sd card jack and very small battery another garbage phone which phones exactly has mm jack or sd card you cant find phone above that has mm jack dont hate phone with stupid reasons
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,screen must be flat battery must be mah camera must have ois cant consider this more ma battery is for xiaomi phones not huaweigoogle or apple cause they have better ui or os so you cant compare capacity
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,harmonyos should be interesting
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,can tsay better display but yea the main sensor on camera is better look at res pro is hz and it is hz
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,for once solid phone the sd will be nice so its not just small soc swap and cameras are upgraded too hope its imx
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,more than cheaper from pro but better display better camera better selfie fro more can tsay better display but yea the main sensor on camera is better
Huawei,nova 9 Pro,deleted post nah us has gives licence to sd for giving them chips but they have to disable modem first in order to supply them
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,good day to you need to know why is my nova se always on edge the sign on left side more there are things you can try and see if its because of settings issue go to settingsconnectionsmobile networksand finally in network mode change from the different settings making sure its set up to lte the other thing is try and see if the carrier provider has one of the network bands needed for to work correctly if they do than see if you have their latest version of their si card in your phone as they update simcard versions at least once or twice per year hope one of these works
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,shocking this is the only huawei phone with yes it is and you forgot that is first huawei phone with snapdragon
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,dont even bother buying huawei products it doesnt support google services which more maybe you dont know an app called gspacebro

Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,with no google play as usual
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,comparing this to the new device xiaomi civi huawei is somehow expensive with useless specs
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,well thought huawei is barred from using us technologies with
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,lcd display
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,thought huawei couldnt use modems in their phones same guess qualcomm made too many chipsets and someone has to use it everyone has to use it
Huawei,nova 9 SE 5G,only slightly more expensive than the version so this is definitely better value still not great value but much better and for people that dont record videos with their phones its pretty good
Huawei,nova 9 SE,so why dont you sell gb version in some countries
Huawei,nova 9 SE,download keyboard for german language everything reverts after soft resetting the phone waaway has to do something about this problem for example fix the problem with an update
Huawei,nova 9 SE,why did you hide the screen lock in the developer options of course everybody on earth is developer they should know it
Huawei,nova 9 SE,installed samsung internet on this phone and it works pre installed browser sux
Huawei,nova 9 SE,found something in the settings there is an option to change the audio to mono as if the phone has more than one speaker using headphones and changing the sound to mono is terrible idea
Huawei,nova 9 SE,battery does charge up full just under minutes but im disappointed with the battery life am use for years very good phone
Huawei,nova 9 SE,not being able to stop super or turbo charging is really annoying brightness turns to automatic after every restart when it is automatic cant see anything on the screen they say there is no google services but youtube works and google search opens on its browser so what is the point
Huawei,nova 9 SE,this not so smart phone keeps telling me there are apps using lots of battery in the background open it and see whatsapp telegram shall just uninstall them because force stopping them would be very similar to uninstalling
Huawei,nova 9 SE,video recording playback isnt processed by the gpu nubb do some research you pos why my nova se can record and this nova se cant
Huawei,nova 9 SE,maybe you should change the specs from os android emui to android emui no add no micro sdcard support
Huawei,nova 9 SE,wheres the wireless debugging
Huawei,nova 9 SE,whatsapp is not working this is serious issue that needs immediate attention
Huawei,nova 9 SE,error in memory card description the memory card slot uses nano sim slot not microsdxc cheers wanna use sd card so bad
Huawei,nova 9 SE,it doesnt support video because it uses an ancient adreno hahaha huawei nova se stil more video recording playback isnt processed by the gpu nubb
Huawei,nova 9 SE,camera isnt good sometimes it doesnt have sound when someon calls and same thing with messagesdroping out fromm apps while tapping message also had problem when lower the screen brithnessthe screen was dark and get the brithness back only when started to charge phone
Huawei,nova 9 SE,idk if its just my phone case but its very durable it has survived so many drops even sto more my nova se havent survived one water flood
Huawei,nova 9 SE,no nm is not detected by this model bought one quite expensive and had bad surprise more micro sd card doesnt even fit in the slot
Huawei,nova 9 SE,nm nano memory card is not detected by this model
Huawei,nova 9 SE,it doesnt have gyroscope in terms of game plays
Huawei,nova 9 SE,phone is pretty good rarely lags good camera for taking photos its shame that this kind of more it doesnt support video because it uses an ancient adreno hahaha huawei nova se still the best kirin ftw
Huawei,nova 9 SE,am in turkey and was having the same problem until minutes ago ive just received more global devices wont get harmonyos anytime soon but you can get service for your phone converted into china version and update to harmonyos httpsministryofsolutionscomhuaweinovaseharmonyosinstallationservice
Huawei,nova 9 SE,my phone is stuck on september update emui phone works good but no security update more am in turkey and was having the same problem until minutes ago ive just received emui with january security patch which dont care about was expecting harmony os because they said they were going to update it to harmony os
Huawei,nova 9 SE,this phone does not have microsd card support my phone is stuck on september update emui phone works good but no security updates till nowanyone else facing this
Huawei,nova 9 SE,so this is one of the worst let me say that again worst devices you can spend your money on more go back to and see why huawei no longer has google services hint blame orange man while not perfect gms can be sideload why pulling apks from aurora store which gets apps from play store its not huaweis fault
Huawei,nova 9 SE,after updated it into emui it was always been freezing and hanging but kinda search about it why my phone is like that it says that it was normal since the update is kinda heavy and the system or other features is still updating in the phone after week or two my phone went back to normal its not hanging or freezing anymore and im glad on that hehe
Huawei,nova 9 SE,nova se huge delay and freezingnot responding afer software update to pls fix guys bcomi more have the same problem after updating my phone is not cooperating at all
Huawei,nova 9 SE,had that problems after update toobut then did factory reset and everything works great now
Huawei,nova 9 SE,mine is also freezing this phone is giving me headache its scary then was considering getting nov se
Huawei,nova 9 SE,since the system update my nova se keeps hanging not only that it also freezes for long more mine is also freezing this phone is giving me headache
Huawei,nova 9 SE,anyone tried emui gb update since the system update my nova se keeps hanging not only that it also freezes for long time and screens goes black for few minutes not even able to restart until it decides to switch back on it also keeps restarting have deleted almost everything from my phone but there is no improvement all the apps installed are always buffering dont know if this has anything to do with the update because it started the same day downloaded and installed it
Huawei,nova 9 SE,excellent phone for the price taking sharp micro photos better than other phones outdoor scenary photo shoot with blue sky is superb
Huawei,nova 9 SE,should have stay vivo and upgrade instead of switching to huawei you fooled people about the camera so sick
Huawei,nova 9 SE,most of the apps are not stable almost year later after purchase the software updates are more emost of its apps need to be updated and you have to download everything and some you fail to download them its useless version it just frustrates me to use it and its complicated for no reason we not it people
Huawei,nova 9 SE,nextgen overpricing
Huawei,nova 9 SE,the nano memory card nm card is huawei invention that offers the same sort of storage as microsd card but in smaller form factor which fits into the sim card slot huaweis nano memory cards are identical in size and shape to nano sim card and are proprietary to huawei mobile devices havent bought the nm card yet but have checked everything about it and think it will definitely work on my huawei nova se also think can fit two nm cards into my dual sim nova se
Huawei,nova 9 SE,owned huawei phones no complains except of coarse google liked them and bought them more honestly real photographer will not only pay attention on the mp only no offense you were fooled by your own
Huawei,nova 9 SE,hi dont know where to start but am huawei phone fan till nova tthen changed to more fast charging is the reason for your battery drain and heat up turn off the phone charge it for hours and then use it for days it also doesnt heat up at all will buy slow charger if can find an original one fast chargers and charging with the computer is not good for the battery
Huawei,nova 9 SE,can gsmarena tell us if any version of this device in any county has microsdxc shared sim slot or not bought one with dual sim and it definitely doesnt have microsd slot if you think can insert microsd card into the second sim slot please reply to this comment and tell me how first checked gsmarena and believed then bought it have been using this website since it started with only gsm phones
Huawei,nova 9 SE,the only good thing about this phone is the battery life and fast charging averaging around hours of screen with wifi data and location turned on however dont play games camera is subpar and my screen got burn in
Huawei,nova 9 SE,over all good phone but camera is not as expect from huawei was using nova and that phone camera was too good other bad thing is software updates plz provide hormony os software in it like nova
Huawei,nova 9 SE,it doesnt have good cameras unfortunately youve to steady your hands for about seconds when taking picture the results arent all that impressive images look dull and theres less details than id like
Huawei,nova 9 SE,for me huawei nova se is not good when it comes its camera feature mp im not convince its not clear its like mp
Huawei,nova 9 SE,same experience here why
Huawei,nova 9 SE,was given one by huawei staff to try out with the hope well order some to sell but more you must let guys from huawei put it on for you have everything on it google everything
Huawei,nova 9 SE,no google no problems just buy huawei nova se yesterday everything works very well iwas worry about maps and youtube but both works well with gbox only this two apps from gbox had been added maps and youtube for others apps install it from aptoide apps market have only one issue and fix it it is about some games and link it with google play games becouse google play games not installed in this device link my games with my facebook account and problem solved totally it is very good device
Huawei,nova 9 SE,its months since bought the phone have an exellent experience while using the phoneits fast the camera is clear
Huawei,nova 9 SE,this is unique device but not worth for money
Huawei,nova 9 SE,if your using gspace for what kind of app if for google app yes use gspace but if for fb and more how will do it
Huawei,nova 9 SE,hi just bought this phone last week and must say so far am impressed screen is amazing the fast charging works wonders am still finding my around this phone but people make big deal about huawie not having gms but think it can be worked around plus for the price it was worth it south africa
Huawei,nova 9 SE,to be honesti really missed my vivo phone since it has better gaming house and performancethe camera is just not good as expected to behuawei really needs to concentrate on the phones performance appstore gaming house camera overheating issues etcsome settings are also only temporary and its so annoyingi would happily appreciate it if you guys fix this issues
Huawei,nova 9 SE,spec wise nova se is better than this nova se have better chipset better performance and dont need hz it consumes more power and gaming is serious for me and this phones gpu is really weak than the nova se gpu
Huawei,nova 9 SE,is anyone also experiencing call communications cut always on nova se every time when dial out the person will not hear me but can hear them than cut the call and dial again than itll be okay if not that in between the call will get cut you cant hear the other person
Huawei,nova 9 SE,honestly very disappointed with this the camera is very blurry indoors features are very lacking wheres the slow motion time lapse ar what kind of vlogging phone caps out at pfps video even the nova had more camera features cpu could have been better its good enough but it couldve been better for the price wheres the headphone jack this isnt flagship phone and most people who are looking to buy cheap phones like this dont have wireless earbuds speakers also sound very weird which makes me use my earbuds instead but like said earlier people without wireless earbuds wont be able to use their headphones battery is fine it does drain pretty fast but they made up for it with the charger that fully charges the phone within an hour gaming can also be pretty annoying once the phone heats up everything becomes slideshow even with performance mode turned on and graphics settings set to lowest it still becomes slideshow the design and grip of the phone is nice though honestly people could just buy the redmi note pro instead similar price to this phone but the camera features are all there plus extra image processing is pretty good even indoors cpu is better battery has higher capacity although charging is only just do not buy this phone
Huawei,nova 9 SE,where put thad sd card in that phone hahahahhaha bro learn first about phone and write text nova we dont have sd memory slot
Huawei,nova 9 SE,phones camera is so blurry regret buying this
Huawei,nova 9 SE,basically honor with faster charging and more expensive
Huawei,nova 9 SE,bulbulitobayagbag aug huawei with google services and huawei without google services is not the same you can really more it is geting much better the appgallery works fine most of the apps are already there if not you ven get them in gspace
Huawei,nova 9 SE,have been using nova se neede my gmail downloaded gspace and everything worked fine just had to create shortcut
Huawei,nova 9 SE,phone is under performing since it has no google store im using apps via google space more if your using gspace for what kind of app if for google app yes use gspace but if for fb and other apps there is lot of ways to download it directly to your phone without the use of gspace
Huawei,nova 9 SE,very dissapointed with phone screen is nice and very snappy and thats it build quality lo more buy iphone if you dont like but dont comment when price is time more big for iphone
Huawei,nova 9 SE,does any user of this phone can confirm or knows if it can take nano memory in one of its slots
Huawei,nova 9 SE,this mobile worth less all work around to install mobile banking apps is mostly failed becau more if its banking apps its difficult to trust the apkworkaround sheesh scary say just wait for the honor devices with google services
Huawei,nova 9 SE,why is there is no display android at huawei nova se no android
Huawei,nova 9 SE,the specs here is expandable in storage but why here on the philippines its not expandable
Huawei,nova 9 SE,whats this im so disappointed its not convenient for gamer and lot of restrition thought more you definitely should watch reviews before buying it has been years since the issue of google and huawei happened
Huawei,nova 9 SE,sooo disappointing specially when it comes to camera mp dont think so always capture more megapixel is just the resolution size of the picture higher megapixel doesnt mean higher quality pictures it still depends on how good the actual lens is
Huawei,nova 9 SE,huawei should drop their prices nowadays if they want to sell out without google its more huawei has always been pricier in comparison to xiaomi
Huawei,nova 9 SE,no radio and jack whataheck what if you want to listen to the radio or watch movie videos and listening misucs without districting others such waste am an avid buyer and huawei customerst time hated their products
Huawei,nova 9 SE,the most worst celphone over why want to buy one tomorrowyou are scaring me now

Huawei,nova 9 SE,so far didnt encounter any problems with my nova se
Huawei,nova 9 SE,hate to be the one complaining but did they seriously need to remove the headphone jack on budget phone with midrange sd chip thats not cool man
Huawei,nova 9 SE,good phone thinness bezels fast charge android video recording just for does it record in

Huawei,nova 9 SE,can we use sd card or nm card not sd card slot but the storage that huawei has was pretty big so no need sd card think
Huawei,nova 9 SE,how to insert memory card
Huawei,nova 9 SE,but with that aside google apps will not function as well as normal withgoogleplay services more but can use the gsapce app for google apps
Huawei,nova 9 SE,so far it run smoothly and camera not bad and not so good it just but absolutely like the designs of huawei novase even it mono speaker but it loud and nice to hear in conclusions buy this phone if you dont have enough money and want unique smartphone on this
Huawei,nova 9 SE,mpx is actually cropped mpx mpx and thats just the number that should att more did not understand you can you explain what you wrote are you saying that this phone has mpx main camera or have this phone and have no objections to the camera but read comment similar to yours in another place so im interested in the answer
Huawei,nova 9 SE,yeah right exiting mp camera until you realise its again plus plus plus the more mpx is actually cropped mpx mpx and thats just the number that should attract you in truth its mpx but when the fight for sales starts then the numbers are important and not the quality the real quality is huawei mate pro pure mpx mp mm wide multidirectional pdaf laser af mp mm periscope telephoto pdaf ois optical zoom mp mm ultrawide pdaf features leica optics led flash panorama hdr video kfps pfps pfps pfps hdr gyroeis
Huawei,nova 9 SE,nobut huawei will be launching new hisilicon chip again in and whether it will still bear the kirin name or another fancy new one like skylight still remains to be seen but huawei also denies rumors of hisilicon skilight soc
Huawei,nova 9 SE,hi bought huawei nm card for my new nova se but it cannot be read by my device is the more the same problem in my case the sim gives you internet data but no calls
Huawei,nova 9 SE,as it stands now only the kirin models have both eis and the sd model is very vague on more wait there is kirin model
Huawei,nova 9 SE,it looks very premium back and front though it doesnt have stabilization on video recording as it stands now only the kirin models have both eis and the sd model is very vague on the details but it looks like unstablized
Huawei,nova 9 SE,yawn another device from huawei absolute snoozefest
Huawei,nova 9 SE,do you know how long it takes to charge the phone from to need to know about the more in just minutes your phone can charge from
Huawei,nova 9 SE,three things this device stand out compare to redmi note has nfc at least in my regi more but the nova has lcd and mono speaker
Huawei,nova 9 SE,not in use europe harmony huawei operating system and
Huawei,nova 9 SE,got mine last dont know if theres problem on this unit or maybe this is one of the downside of thia model it lagged and needs to turn off and on also in playing mobile legends it stopped during the clash
Huawei,nova 9 SE,well its huawei it will have outstanding camera performance and many else by the way harmony soon or later will be way better than google unless android came to the world everybody liked symbian this going to be same thing
Huawei,nova 9 SE,yeah its one of the best brands with no google play service google apps are easily installed after purchasing the phone like all other huawei phones
Huawei,nova 9 SE,huawei is still not support stereo speaker in all your phones this is very weak point weakness tell now really surprising and impressive hope to wish think about this well please look into this
Huawei,nova 9 SE,huawei is best yeah its one of the best brands with no google play service
Huawei,nova 9 SE,in europe is wtf in the us
Huawei,nova 9 SE,price us no android no wifi no in europe is wtf
Huawei,nova 9 SE,bad at everything adreno and no google services and is under
Huawei,nova 9 SE,please inform people about iso option for huawei phones also compared withe other brands
Huawei,nova 9 SE,think huwawei is scam phone maker there is no phone better than huawei
Huawei,nova 9 SE,rather buy poco big difference in terms of specs and small difference in terms of price even poco is better than nova not se version no google play as well basically it possess all level of scams
Huawei,nova 9 SE,cant stop laughing at this phone omg hahahahahah half priced xiaomi is better
Huawei,nova 9 SE,why dont all huawei phones not support stereo speaker while all other companies support the stereo speakers in the same as the price category
Huawei,nova 9 SE,doesnt support video in this chipset
Huawei,nova 9 SE,why dont all huawei phones not support ois camera
Huawei,nova 9 SE,bruh since when snapdragon capable for recording and support up to mp its just speculation will eventually change once confirmed or released
Huawei,nova 9 SE,how can this thing record with its sd bro
Huawei,nova 9 SE,inch with small mah battery ips screen single speaker useless mp macro and no gms more camera better than redmi note pro
Huawei,nova 9 SE,and they wanna compete with the xiaomi redmi note in terms of specifications this doesn more redmi note pro better than note
Huawei,nova 9 SE,my only concern here is the ips lcd display shouldve gotten oled atleast more or less dont care bout gems anymore know my ways through that
Huawei,nova 9 SE,nova and and pro was android and android is open source os so sanctions cant st more sanctions has always stopped them thats why you to learn the origin of harmony os
Huawei,nova 9 SE,huawei doesnt have access to android was thinking if they ever had in the first pla more nova and and pro was android and android is open source os so sanctions cant stop huawei for using it
Huawei,nova 9 SE,how can it video if the chipset can only generate video only you are talking about the selfie can you should check the main cam it has fps
Huawei,nova 9 SE,huaweicentral said it is android think gsmarena was worng huawei doesnt have access to android was thinking if they ever had in the first place for the pass couple of years the recent emui were based on android including the latest emui
Huawei,nova 9 SE,its android bro huaweicentral said it is android think gsmarena was worng
Huawei,nova 9 SE,am so disappointed in this phone no google play service mah battery this phone is somet more hms now huawei mobile services
Huawei,nova 9 SE,nice to see here but overpriced
Huawei,nova 9 SE,just whywhy snapdragon is why the price is huge for what set up he have since it actually ended up being the like it its not great value but its not absolute garbage like it wouldve been with the
Huawei,nova 9 SE,doesnt excuse pathetic battery and lack of mm jack huawei have totally lost the plot more yes you are absolutely correct
Huawei,nova 9 SE,
Huawei,nova 9 SE,not even just yea typo
Huawei,nova 9 SE,sd card sd card but sd
Huawei,nova 9 SE,they probably arent allowed to buy newer socs specially those with also their soc ra more doesnt excuse pathetic battery and lack of mm jack huawei have totally lost the plot when you are in disadvantage the sane thing to do is compensate with what you can instead their logic is well our phone is shitty anyway lets make it even worse
Huawei,nova 9 SE,snapdragon but why tho they probably arent allowed to buy newer socs specially those with also their soc raw supplied is getting low so they cant also make new kirin socs thanks to unclsam
Huawei,nova 9 SE,or even use the mediatek dimensity versions
Huawei,nova 9 SE,cant they just use sd or
Huawei,nova 9 SE,good sd
Huawei,nova 9 SE,say hello to redmi note what literally none of the specs are even close and its huawei
Huawei,nova 9 SE,that looks like quad camera setup to me and not triple but oh well more importantly in for eur insane
Huawei,nova Flip,stop with those smartphone fights like vro samsung vs apple nobody cares like em both more who asked
Huawei,nova Flip,unfortunately no thats your opinion whats with the whole your opinion thing dont think the person who you replied to gets it either
Huawei,nova Flip,no stop with those smartphone fights like vro samsung vs apple nobody cares like em both and huawei like you ur opinion is invalid
Huawei,nova Flip,do not ever comment this again brub no
Huawei,nova Flip,okay ok
Huawei,nova Flip,nothing okay
Huawei,nova Flip,not you again seriously youre suggesting that euro phone is better than more thats your opinion
Huawei,nova Flip,kirin around snapdragon gen level actually cpu wise is on par with sd gen but gpu wise is near dimensity
Huawei,nova Flip,also hope they also provide an opensource version that can be customized even if only on hua more bearing the same feelings
Huawei,nova Flip,kirin kirin around snapdragon gen level
Huawei,nova Flip,cptpower aug well huawei said good bye to google and am happy for that decsion time to become independed more also hope they also provide an opensource version that can be customized even if only on huawei phones
Huawei,nova Flip,knowing their pricing history its going to be at least euros and not that suggested price down there
Huawei,nova Flip,im sorry what you said didnt mean anything will only wait for huawei when they more well huawei said good bye to google and am happy for that decsion time to become independed and better os tan ios or android they can make it and will support them way can if needed for example by buying some huawei devices
Huawei,nova Flip,but unfortunately the cover screen resolution offered is only if it could be hd more bro main screen is the main gamer coer screen is for basic tasks like showing date and time or who is messaging or calling you using the cover screen for something big is not very clever idea
Huawei,nova Flip,kirin feel sorry for huawei the kirin chipset only has the advantage of only power saving with tdp really huawei is at dead end at least huawei should be able to make kirin xe or kirin xpro ultra which is equivalent to snapdragon gen
Huawei,nova Flip,to me it looks way better and way cheaper than samsung nothing else needed huawei harmony os is great and for those who cant live with spy google run the huawei app store search for gblox app and install it voilaaa your huawei flip phone runs latest android with unlimited support for as long as hardware will keeps up
Huawei,nova Flip,the huawei pura ultra smartphone is expected to be released on april with be more bro its did ou time travel from future whats the next numbers for powerball lottery whats the next numbers for lottery euromillions here in europe
Huawei,nova Flip,hows google support heard from reviewers that it wont somehow launch google apps bro download and install gblox app from the huawe store you get latest android version with unlimited support problem solved for computer use bluestacks latest addition which works pretty well with windows to have latest android version in my computer
Huawei,nova Flip,none of the people have commented so ill be the first to comment huawei youre unfortuna more bro you funny thin phones will overheat lot trust me and are easy to break
Huawei,nova Flip,apartenly this device might be global also it is confirmed that uses kirin more the huawei pura ultra smartphone is expected to be released on april with bezelless design and clear inch oled touchscreen with resolution of pixels and hz refresh rate this smartphone also features nfc is water and dust resistant and runs on harmonyos price at to
Huawei,nova Flip,since this got only they need to bring this globally its not only but we havent seen the network support details yet will update when they are published
Huawei,nova Flip,deleted post hows google support heard from reviewers that it wont somehow launch google apps
Huawei,nova Y60,how to track this phone how to track it
Huawei,nova Y60,this device not being able to provide any google services is really challenge suggest som more ive been using the huawei nova for while now and while it has its pros and cons think its decent option in the budget range for everyday use the mah battery is definitely highlightit lasts me more than full day even with regular social media use and video streaming the display size is also great for watching content or browsing especially with the wide screen and good color output for its price that said agree with others here that the lack of google play services can be real limitation had to explore alternatives like appgallery and install gspace to get whatsapp and other essential apps to work it takes little effort initially but its manageable once you get the hang of it huawei should definitely work on making this transition easier for users who arent very techsavvy overall if youre someone who mainly uses phone for calls messages basic apps and enjoys long battery life the nova is quite solid for its price point just be ready to take few extra steps to get your favorite apps up and running hope this helps someone whos considering this mobile
Huawei,nova Y60,clouding space under the huawei platform is too small plus the issue of not being able to bypass in adding google account is huge downside to the potential market in africa because the main search engines are google based
Huawei,nova Y60,why it doesnt have radio available
Huawei,nova Y60,still dont believe this was huawei in same
Huawei,nova Y60,it says about eur and since its huawei phone kinda believe its more honor just released the which has similar display fast charging qualcomm snapdragon gb ram with micro sd up to tb and all of these specs along with google mobile service at slightly lower price tag than the nova
Huawei,nova Y60,is this part of nova series or series
Huawei,nova Y60,exactly phone that doesnt have any google mobile services shouldnt be selling more the also has better main camera
Huawei,nova Y60,where does it state the price it says about eur and since its huawei phone kinda believe its gonna be close to that which is way too much for this phone in
Huawei,nova Y61,man this phone is good for years but it lagging and fast drain battery and no google more years
Huawei,nova Y61,dope smart jusst got implicated will most def upgrademodifysecure its specs and avoid reddit comedians
Huawei,nova Y61,how do one get his no saved on google contact do in have to put by you can download google play store its works fine
Huawei,nova Y61,please how can get huawei nova sensor
Huawei,nova Y61,build up the os to google services
Huawei,nova Y61,friend of mine asked me to help him solve some issues due to giving phone to some bank employee who messed up the accounts the bad thing ive noticed is terrible lag of touch its really annoying it literally takes half second to register touch on icons and keyboard the rest works acceptable
Huawei,nova Y61,my phone not appear or geven my sim card is
Huawei,nova Y61,hate to break it to you this model of huawei is the worst one that ive had my old huawei phone could run other games better than the and the storage is really small and sensitive despite the size of the phone itself my nanny huawei user has better expierences with another huawei model despite the age of it not reccomending it
Huawei,nova Y61,yes it happens to me as well and im really tired of this have found any solution also have that problem
Huawei,nova Y61,mine works perfectly hate to say but people do get defected products so for those complaining the one in million odds seemed to have not worked in your favor
Huawei,nova Y61,anyone who knows how to hard reset nova
Huawei,nova Y61,like everything about this phone the camera is superb
Huawei,nova Y61,ummm this phone is weak now and the specs is not good
Huawei,nova Y61,not worth the money lot of apps especially bank apps delivery apps social media apps ar more years ago from is keep seeing this date perhaps phones were indeed better in than these days
Huawei,nova Y61,same here with the amount of money bought it here in my country could have bought good more samsung series can die after months of usage requiring cpu solder reflowing so everything isnt rose colored in samsungland will say however displaying ads in the inbuilt phone apps is terrible
Huawei,nova Y61,very bad phone ever have seen not working google apps properly because of the gspace alway more hey dear you can download modded app without advertisements in google
Huawei,nova Y61,very great product give it stars problem its screenthe screen is sensitive one mistake you will see inks better put screen protector thought it was kunlun glassbut so far its great product will fix my screen
Huawei,nova Y61,am not able to access google play services on my huawei nova how can solve that problem more hie dear also have huawei nova and im well with it learnt how to use it instead of building attitude against it if you check its os it is an emui not android meaning that android softwares or apps do not apply best on it this phone uses the huawei app gallery instead of google app store petal search instead of google search gbox instead of google drive etc all these apps are there in your phone thats my advice to you
Huawei,nova Y61,if thinking of buying this say ur going to regret this try buying an samsung instead hate to disagree with you anonymous but this is great phone at the price with great battery life and functionality if you hate it so much why did you buy it
Huawei,nova Y61,great phone with excellent battery life no problem downloading apps and huawei health is great on this device ive owned many iphones and samsungs but this huawei is the best of the lot especially for the low price
Huawei,nova Y61,does anyone experience low volume when having video calls its too annoying the volume is so low couldnt hear the other person when talking whats the essence of video call if have to put the speakers on my ear to hear what the person is saying
Huawei,nova Y61,hate this phone cannot recommend to anyone wish knew would have bought good more same here with the amount of money bought it here in my country could have bought good samsung they should change their way its not good at all
Huawei,nova Y61,very bad phone will make sure never to recommend huawei nova to my friends and relatives its bad you have to struggle for apps unlike sumsang regret buying it they should change this their way its very annoying was banned from using whatsapp apparently thirdparty app tried gbox didnt work how are you managing with nonsense phone cant live without whatsapp
Huawei,nova Y61,why is no chipset thought its kirin pls update
Huawei,nova Y61,if you huawei lover like me you will find it fun to use nova as it has three options to more am not able to access google play services on my huawei nova how can solve that problem thank you
Huawei,nova Y61,true not even gsmarena has the full specs how come
Huawei,nova Y61,deleted post true
Huawei,nova Y61,not too bad like the thickness of the phone and size the storage is fair love that it is dual sim the camera is also fair
Huawei,nova Y61,what stupid thing to say appgallery is now so full with all amazing apps besides that in more exactly right it is lovely phone google apps work perfectly once downloaded gspace
Huawei,nova Y61,really nice phone at the low price really enjoy using it my old huawei lite is still working brilliantly as well ive owned six apple iphones but they have become so expensive these days these huaweis are really great value for money and work really well
Huawei,nova Y61,nice phone particularly good value with lots of features at the low price
Huawei,nova Y61,currently use this as my new phone im to put my bank account worst thing the otp has sho more this phone is terrible very terrible mean it is one of the annoying smartphone ever im moving back to samsung
Huawei,nova Y61,octa core am supposed to guess which core is that oh come on
Huawei,nova Y61,the loudspeaker feature for messenger app is bad is it because the speaker nodules located at the top and has holes only
Huawei,nova Y61,this has to be one of the worst cameras ive ever had to to deal with they claim its mp but in reality it may even be mp im dissapointed
Huawei,nova Y61,soc huawei hisilicon kirin cpu ghz arm cortexa ghz arm cortexa co more sure
Huawei,nova Y61,how is the camera quality of this phone very bad
Huawei,nova Y61,if its using nm below sorry to say they are banned from being made by usa so huawei is stuck more soc huawei hisilicon kirin cpu ghz arm cortexa ghz arm cortexa cores gpu arm malig mp mhz
Huawei,nova Y61,processor is kirin
Huawei,nova Y61,the chinese processors in smartphones as long as they can keep the price point down really more do believe that they will keep the price reasonable once they are able to mass produce their own soc they arent greedy like what the west does by sanctioning them
Huawei,nova Y61,they already have successfully reached nm are probably lacking fabbing machines to mass more the chinese processors in smartphones as long as they can keep the price point down really low of every device there in and iron out the main problem with them using too much power too run and few bugs here and there they be really good think its more important they use as little power too run as possible then scoring high on benchmarks ive got high hopes for unisoc and hope allwinner is still being made also if the device there in are dirt cheap there short comings will be overlooked given enough time one day they might be good
Huawei,nova Y61,nice looking ifone like but try some compak or smaler size incher
Huawei,nova Y61,at the os write huawei mobile services hms instead of google mobile services gms
Huawei,nova Y61,meani understand it is supposed to be low budget phone the specs speak for themselvesbut why did they have to use that trashy iphoney design
Huawei,nova Y61,wouldnt it be cheaper since they arent gonna outsource it to tsmc for fabbing but locally true like they have raw materials available can even get from friendly nations like russiankorea safrica etc they just lack fabbing machines to mass produce since usa banned them from getting older duv machines
Huawei,nova Y61,kinda want too see huawei survive really hope too see unisoc processor or allwinner pro more they already have successfully reached nm are probably lacking fabbing machines to mass produce maybe next year or so we see nm chinese fabbed socs be used few more years they reach nm nm etc with how unexpectedly fast they are going even being sanctioned by usa
Huawei,nova Y61,the bezels are so thin on the images like it for entry level phone
Huawei,nova Y61,in factmaybe china can produce nm chip but it has high cost and low qualification rate so more wouldnt it be cheaper since they arent gonna outsource it to tsmc for fabbing but locally
Huawei,nova Y61,wasnt china able to already produce nm chips why dont huawei use those for their more in factmaybe china can produce nm chip but it has high cost and low qualification rate so if huawei use it in midrange or entry level phonethe price will be high and chinese cant stand this even huawei posted pocket with gthey are angry with the price
Huawei,nova Y61,maybe this chip is new kirinbecause the score in antutu is around thousand the kiri more wasnt china able to already produce nm chips why dont huawei use those for their midrange or entry level phone
Huawei,nova Y61,kirin same performance on sd years ago chipset maybe this chip is new kirinbecause the score in antutu is around thousand the kirina is around thousand and kirina is produced by tsmc but this chip may be produced by smic
Huawei,nova Y61,iphone camera design soo innovative
Huawei,nova Y61,did they just blatantly copied iphone camera design
Huawei,nova Y61,huawei could have used emui for this phone and others that came after mate
Huawei,nova Y61,very iphone
Huawei,nova Y61,huawei compete apple by making android phones look like iphoneswow they could redesign more this was not designed by huawei just took this trash from someone else and slapped their logo
Huawei,Nova Y63,they kinda rehouse them them with new colors or they just painted it over you just killed me
Huawei,Nova Y63,or are they just recycling old unsold phones they are doing just that but more they kinda rehouse them them with new colors or they just painted it over
Huawei,Nova Y63,is this very outdated device real or its just joke wow
Huawei,Nova Y63,this company loves the snapdragon
Huawei,Nova Y63,its just rumour because huawei dosent use android and it cant use snapdragon processor snapdragon is an old processor they might still have them in their stock they cant use the new chips though
Huawei,Nova Y63,the useless terrible sd cards are the last reason why this phone is actually useless more because you bought fake cheapo sdcards still have my toshiba exceria gb card from or so years ago still works until today didnt get corrupted whatsoever
Huawei,Nova Y63,how is it possible for huawei to use the snapdragon processor as long as chipset its fine
Huawei,Nova Y63,deleted post the useless terrible sd cards are the last reason why this phone is actually useless terrible phone there are far worse problems with this manufactured ewaste than just slow corruptionprone sd cards that are essentially just portable emmc storage with even worse reliability
Huawei,Nova Y63,this looks oddly familiar cant lay my finger on what phone its trying to mimic tho
Huawei,Nova Y63,just how many more old stock of sd huawei have to dispose or are they just recycling old more or are they just recycling old unsold phones they are doing just that but without any rehousing needed just take look at the huawei and ys and this device they are all essentially the same things
Huawei,Nova Y63,this is nice if only it comes along with the kirin does nt lag this battery could lasts several days the watt fast charging is much better than how wish those features in my huawei plite
Huawei,Nova Y63,apparently its just downgraded ys not listed on gsmarena for some reason which means it has better soc than the lmao
Huawei,Nova Y63,outdated waste
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,very low end wouldnt recommend didnt even get emui stuck on the version you get out of the box bad performancecustomatisation is very limitednot even gonna talk about you need emulators to run half of the apps you need the camera is badbut expectedbut gotta mention that the battery is pretty good
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,for those struggling to open google apps the phone doesnt support google services so use third party apps like gspace
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,absolute dumpster fire doesnt even got ac for phone released in smh
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,why are my app not opening this phone is making me stranded because your not thinking
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,my apps never comes up am just so disappointed with this phone
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,amazing phone for the price ive had this phone for almost years now and its showing minimal signs of degradation or performance loss the only thing really dont like is not having google play services but its quite niche there are alternatives like gspace and other google emulators
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,honor anyone
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,the chipset kirin of this phone is equalvient to snapdragon which means this phone more bro use the same phone and its fking underrated here this phone is too good for that price
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,used to watch dzangis on this phonevery good quality
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,just sold of the doubletrouble
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,got it as gift in huawei appgallery promo yeah but it is nova in my country
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,pay more and you can get way more with samsung trust me its worth it prefer huawei to samsung so dont trust you
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,really slick phone mah loooooooooong battery life brilliant camera especially wide and panorama gb storage very happy
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,why huawei nova has not supported gyroscope
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,camera sucks
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,hope the nova comes with amoled at least hz and better chipset like mediated how is this phone
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,octacore is not chipset manufacturer lol prize
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,have more then one theme and everything works there but had to downgrade the phone clone more love huawei mate does the brand arrived nigeria if yes how much the bottom price of this beautiful
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,its actually fps
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,cant capture portrait photos clearly why maybe you can call huaweis phone or leave this problem in huaweis website in chinawe can receive gift if we tell bug to huawei
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,ive always had samsung then got huawei not this model hated it you can download google as an app learnt to enjoy my huawei for years no problems wonderful battery life and no other issues inherited my sisters samsung notebook yeah fancy phone lost my whatsapp chat history but anyways life goes on absolutely wish had my huawei back gave to my son this samsung sucks short battery life takes ages to charge its only years old the cameras crappy single sim weighs ton and developed moisture damage issue which is apparently common there was no moisture anywhere so now want another huawei was looking at nova se but see the bad reviews is it really that bad which other average priced huawei is out there with better reviews
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,check on youtube there is plenty of tutorial how to install space ah gspace recently got introduced to it not an ideal solution but practical it installs gms on guest system instead of the host via virtualisation like parallel space ourplay vmos
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,detectivekhalifah oct of course it would be for some could you explain how to me check on youtube there is plenty of tutorial how to install space
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,its easy of course it would be for some could you explain how to me

Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,that display size seems way too big for that resolution if you think this is big enough for display look at tecno pouvoir series this has similar size as poco
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,what if you need to search something if google has more than petals search engine in more you can easy dowload google search from petal
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,so confuse no google service but the basic is android the basic is android repeat
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,only you those who to get isolated to google for one dont rely on any google stuff so more what if you need to search something if google has more than petals search engine in huawei phones
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,support this postthe worse phone have ever seen in my entire life before
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,if google services are not available then it is disaster to own this phone only you those who to get isolated to google for one dont rely on any google stuff so im fine many others
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,do not have nfc but not for everyone it is important phone and battery seems good think about buy it neet see it first
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,agree couldnt log in on any of sites and apps that requires google services even more if google services are not available then it is disaster to own this phone
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,huawei just launched nova this phone is identical to the plus only difference is the storage space which is gb saw it on the south african huawei store web page this honestly doesnt make sense why they did that lol
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,mrexpertthis is not the fault of gsmarena teameven huawei themselves didnt type the more can confirm it have the phone did spec check and it is kirin
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,so dear gsmarena which chipset cpu gpu does this phone have mean since it has been more mrexpertthis is not the fault of gsmarena teameven huawei themselves didnt type the name of the chip on their spec sheeti can tell you that believe that it is the kirin and the unboxers from china had already proved it
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,purchased the phone week ago and im not happy with my purchase its frustrating more agree couldnt log in on any of sites and apps that requires google services even tho just bought it few weeks ago some apps are lagging already its camera is also disappointing compare to other phones have used in the past theres lot of disadvantages of this phone for me its kinda frustrating to purchase it
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,huawei any day this brand is one of the best in my view and has not disappointed me so just more been using this fone other than dissapointments of no having google stuff else is great
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,just purchase huawei nova dqys ago one of the wrost phone have ever see in my life more totally agree with you
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,as long it have no youtube app preinstall in it then im good
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,just before the us ban bought huawei and for very cheap price that phone was more blu is american
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,am amazed at all the comments here thats bashes huawei phones wouldnt be surprised more finally positive comment about huawei av been using prime bought it in upto date is still working its only that broke it and now want new one thinking of buying nova se but th comments are scaring me away wanna try this nova before they remove it from the market the one that have longlastimg battery and th cameras are perfect but it now broke koz dint put screen protector
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,actually people just bash the phone because of no gms and they think its overpriced to be hon more you should see the huawei mate xs
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,all of brands have sneaky practices that just how businesses works around the world yeah but they didnt get banned resulting in their business plummeting
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,just bought this recently and its just great overall the phone is not bad at all first experience with huawei and cant complain
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,good brand but no google services huawei should lower their prices its still overprice ill rather go for redmi note with amoled display ppi with punch hole rather than ips display and very low pixel density of
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,look at this for second know they were banned because they could potentially open back more the fact of the matter is they are still banned
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,bulbulitobayagbag jun ive used huawei even before the ban took effect around back then they were more all of brands have sneaky practices that just how businesses works around the world
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,interesting fact some guy in china tore open enjoy phone and found out something interes more that is sneaky typical huawei ive used huawei back in that had this chip back then it was new and shiny this is why you got banned huawei stop being sneaky
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,bulbulitobayagbag jun its waste of money really also the kirin was released in its year old chipset more interesting fact some guy in china tore open enjoy phone and found out something interesting the phone is using kirin but there is difference it has new chip number here is list of the different numbers kirin higfcv kirin higfcv kirin higfcv kirin new higfcvh the last one was found in the enjoy this might make it new chip that had been printed recently and not before the ban huawei is hiding some details on the chip well my point is this chip might also be in the nova plus since its relatively new phone it also didnt make sense to me that they still have stock of the kirin so am guessing that they might have made this new chips and they are not telling anyone
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,fun fact this is rebranded lower budget huawei yp lmao fun fact yp had way better screen different size and little battery in comparsion with
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,poor adreno and gpu not fit for the price
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,with no google play services how is new apps added to this phone via their own app gallery tried using it with gspace googles suite of apps it was painful experience and not worth the trouble at all so if you are not from china please stay away from huawei thank me later
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,how to troubleshoot this model my huawei app seemed to help me slightly or you can chat with an agent if its something thats not listed hope this helps
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,thats quiet surprising get about hours screen on time for constant use of about more ive deleted some streaming apps and think it might have helped what apps are you running in general

Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,this phone have chipset snapdragon octacore ghz gpu adreno for the price of this phone and that processor doubt it highly as this phone it costs and the nova which has that processor costs strongly doubt its that processor but it would be great if it is bought the plus on nice special with gifts so will get it tuesday then will be able to see its processor for sure
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,all points says its helio looking at it having bluetooth and it uses mp camera it cant be helios as the helios is limited to mp cameras and blutooth
Huawei,nova Y70 Plus,how come chipset is unspecified you mean no update yet all points says its helio

Huawei,nova Y72,os upgradable
Huawei,nova Y72,homero chino apr and huawei leave aside the kirin and instead use the kirin with those phones yeah because the kirin is bad now at least kirin with benchmark score
Huawei,nova Y72,anonymous may plan to get that in july is it true that the internal memory is gbi would advise you to get the nova instead it has triple camera setup and has an ultra wide camera too the rest of the specs of the nova are the same as this one or you could get the which has more ram and storage than the if you care about the new button you should get the because the button isnt available on the and

Huawei,nova Y72,huawei truly delusional
Huawei,nova Y72,huawei must stop using that nano memory card especially in their entry level devices that thing is so hard to find and expensive too unlike micro sdcards they think people not in china still want this specs and pricing just because its huawei and forget that they dont have google services people rely on google services whatever they do so they are the one who needs to adjust not their users
Huawei,nova Y72,doenrico feb nice phone the biggest problem is that the phone hasnt google or place store when moreare you using thisnor another low end huawei have no issue using microgaurora solution on my tablet
Huawei,nova Y72,knightriderkarr jan disappointment tft lcd kirin years old chip no nfc mono speakerhuawei official website mentions this has nfc support the specs is too low for the price httpsconsumerhuaweicomphphonesnovayspecs

Huawei,nova Y72,got my nova today am amazed with this good quality phone even if it hasnt even got google playstore its easy to operate and fast sound is good
Huawei,nova Y72,just got this phone great phone and it is affordable
Huawei,nova Y72,this is already worse than redmi note at this point
Huawei,nova Y72,aod really
Huawei,nova Y72,if its gonna be global launch im sure all people outside of china are very happy with it
Huawei,nova Y72,johnclinton jan huawei is coming back globally reallydream on
Huawei,nova Y72,same as prime but minor difference only
Huawei,nova Y72,very bad id
Huawei,nova Y72,anonymous jan and kirin ppi in only fpsno this is the preorder price with gifts after that the smartphone will be much cheaper
Huawei,nova Y72,and kirin ppi in only fps
Huawei,nova Y72,anyway no global release it will stay in china
Huawei,nova Y72,dark blade jan this is literally another huawei enjoy but more expensive its the enjoy for the international market
Huawei,nova Y72,jin jan nm chip in is joke
Huawei,nova Y72,stoon jan time travel exists this phone is proof
Huawei,nova Y72,this is literally another huawei enjoy but more expensive
Huawei,nova Y72,disappointment tft lcd kirin years old chip no nfc mono speaker
Huawei,nova Y72,time travel exists this phone is proof
Huawei,nova Y72,yeah its overpriced downgrade from huawei shouldnt even exist in the budget market in the first place
Huawei,nova Y72,omg this one is serious candidate to joke of the year seriously huawei is just trying to rip us off not even oppo would dare to release something with these specs at this price
Huawei,nova Y72,this price has to be mistake nm chipset think alan turing worked with more advanced processors in his time also no headphone jack in what should be an absolute entry level phone
Huawei,nova Y72,piece of junk worse than galaxy as at almost three times the price plus no google
Huawei,nova Y72,huawei went from the best value in smartphones into the absolute worst am really sorry for anyone who buys this garbage piece of plastic that they call phone for you could literally get that have times better specs and google services
Huawei,nova Y72,back with the kirin though the design looks nice guess
Huawei,nova Y72,good luck
Huawei,nova Y72,waitwhat bucks dont even have force to complain bye
Huawei,Nova Y72S,its eur in russia approx same price with pova neo kinda ok phone for daily use among those people who are not interested in gaming because snap in theory gives you longer battery life and less overheating
Huawei,Nova Y72S,worthless trash supposed to be priced at or euros just hope its mistake more yeah they shouldve use their new harmonyos instead
Huawei,Nova Y72S,its over for huawei it actually so isnt over for huawei as their toptier phones generate lot of profit for them this said do believe they should ditch all of their entrylevel lineup and should start from the nova line only
Huawei,Nova Y72S,huawei is just dead who in heir right mind would pay so much for such an outdated phone even at this is way too expensive
Huawei,Nova Y72S,display again
Huawei,Nova Y72S,wow huawei is finally catching up to the samsung as from two years ago and huaweis current offering only costs over twice as much as the as did when it launched
Huawei,Nova Y72S,turns out it is belarus ruble not russian ruble so byn is the ticker eur final price eur for device with year old entry level specs and year old android version no thanks
Huawei,Nova Y72S,seems like that in which case huawei at least knows exactly how much this phone actually worths turns out it is belarus ruble not russian ruble so byn is the ticker eur final price
Huawei,Nova Y72S,correct me if am wrong but this phone for nonsubscribers in russia costs less than eur more seems like that in which case huawei at least knows exactly how much this phone actually worths
Huawei,Nova Y72S,snapdragon on huawei how well its snapdragon from and one that is essentially just snapdragon from but slightly overclocked and has smaller transistor size but its still way underpowered for even the most basic of tasks
Huawei,Nova Y73,this chipset of this phone used same as huawei matepad super ewaste insert laughing emoji here
Huawei,Nova Y73,the chipset it has is worse than and this somehow get configuration and upper just wth
Huawei,Nova Y73,my mom uses nova with the same chipset it lags alot and heats up most of the time cant even play basic games like mlbb
Huawei,Nova Y73,could just huawei make new kirin chips or just stop trying hard and use mediateks kirin is literally years old by now
Huawei,Nova Y73,huawei finally released android phones again in is that true
Huawei,Nova Y73,kirina this is so overpriced compared to its competitors with the same price as this one
Huawei,Nova Y73,android check the geekbench
Huawei,Nova Y73,got mine and love it its emui but with official microg support from huawei so you can install all apps from play store and google using aurora store everything works just like any android devices with google support
Huawei,Nova Y73,do you always talk like this is there problem with me talking like that
Huawei,Nova Y73,aesthetically it holds up what else is good about it decent ram batt ttheres only more do you always talk like this
Huawei,Nova Y73,smartphone with processor eww hahaha
Huawei,Nova Y73,bruhh the chipset and adroid version hard pass for this device
Huawei,Nova Y73,android very expensive old android wifi
Huawei,Nova Y73,but that says emui android or emui is just the skin just like samsungs oneui xiaomi hyperos etc that they customize while the core system anroid is still mostlikely based on or below
Huawei,Nova Y73,huawei ya huawei nova huawei nova huawei nova huawei nova are have hisilicon kirin in short all series since reason in before the ban took down huawei they had very big and huge plan for global china regions they wanted to make very cheap and worth smartphone that everyone can do buy it example huawei then after that they start preparing for the plan they decided to make chipset called hisilicon kirin in short downgraded version of hisilicon kirin they made huge copy of them after that they were preparing for the huge plan to took the marketshare from global and china but unfortunately the ban took huawei down and they slowed down they decided to continue the important plans not this after that they forgot the plan the chipsets was useless after that huawei decided to put the hisilicon kirin on every cheap phone they have to make it out of stock since then they are still releasing phones with hisilicon kirin this was the story of hisilicon kirin hope you enjoyed it thank you for reading it huawei reminder
Huawei,Nova Y73,one update of android and this phone not gonna happen google revoked license to use android after android on huawei so thats why theyre stuck till
Huawei,Nova Y73,its actually android and how can you know have you already tried it
Huawei,Nova Y73,sfe is actually slated for android updates oneui honestly just better more fe is mid range flagship maybe or just flagship but is budget phone updates or just
Huawei,Nova Y73,here the fe version cost rs gb with android snapdragon more sfe is actually slated for android updates oneui honestly just better than the lol
Huawei,Nova Y73,and its like proof that older stuff is just better im gonna pick up fe for more here the fe version cost rs gb with android snapdragon im sure that phone users got android update too maybe one ui too its years update soo fe fe have same battery you can go with fe if you want ai rs gb and fe gb rs fe versions are best deals you can check amazonin
Huawei,Nova Y73,deleted post and its like proof that older stuff is just better im gonna pick up fe for like us freedom eagles thats an amazing deal whereas this is like usd what in the world is huawei thinking
Huawei,Nova Y73,guys think this phone will run on emui based on android thats because some cer more one update of android and this phone
Huawei,Nova Y73,oh hello there my very very old friend atleast it isnt the nm variant
Huawei,Nova Y73,android bro its actually android
Huawei,Nova Y73,ayoo android is this for real its actually android because it has kirin
Huawei,Nova Y73,kirina wtf
Huawei,Nova Y73,worst phone of for real
Huawei,nova Y90,my mom had this phone and ever since it was inhereted to me ill say its very good not really gaming type but can actually handle it also has built in game booster and phone cleaner in the settings which actually surprises me the camera is kinda mid but the performance in the software is very very great for its price hope huawei comes up with another update hope lol
Huawei,nova Y90,listen have this phone its good performer with gb of ram you can play codmobile on more yeah but theres no more software support im on emui no update since last year july
Huawei,nova Y90,is there fm radio how is selfie quality whats the android version running or upd more just normal phone
Huawei,nova Y90,so here am using huawei nova for one year almost so for google services there is absolutely no problem just download the gbox and gspace and then you have access too all services transferred from techno and am using all services google youtube insta all but you also have to keep in mind that while these apps opening google they taje few seconds to open up so for camera overall it is good not the best but it works very good also for gaming it is good you can play as long as hrs continue the screen tine for me last for hrs usage beside my phone charges within mints from to percent charges comes with in watt so overall everything works fine the fingerprint the camera the gaming especially the battery is very very good accompanied with thw watt chargeryou wont get any android updates bcs it doesnt support it so no features of android as well after all this screen is very very very good used many mobiles like redmi honor lite but this screen is the best so acc to me it us very good phone in this pointi hope it helped
Huawei,nova Y90,its nothing on lite overall ratings or
Huawei,nova Y90,its actually excellent at the price pointhas gb ram and gb rommost of them say its descentbut this phone is so powerful thus it can run most of apps and games smoothly with no visible lag or delay andnot having google services is not at all problemand really appreciate huawei and teamto bring such promising and powerful smartphones in the marketstill after us ban hats off huawei
Huawei,nova Y90,you could just get samsung for way cheaper why even buy this
Huawei,nova Y90,which is overall better device realme redminnote vs nova lack of google no more the redmi has the best hardware between the phones with the more powerful chipset better display louder speaker ip splash resistance and more useful cameras the redmi also has gyroscope that is not available on the realme and huawei
Huawei,nova Y90,im thinking of buying this phone huawei nova those that already bought would you more camera is not bad think you just need to have skill on how to take photographs colours are close to accurate thats the nice thing
Huawei,nova Y90,proximity sensor died after days not recommend anyone to buy this phone huawei is known to have history of failures as their phones age the most common failure is the battery which start to swell after nearly yrs and how kirin chips cannot last whole decade while snapdragon and helio can easily last decade without dying suddenly in fact dont know any huawei device that lasted decade when know that older galaxy gt despite being yrs old device still works in
Huawei,nova Y90,at first cant appreciate the camera and still prefer using my yo vivo probought to replace it but im getting the hang of it now the night mode is good and in good lighting the color is accurate where the pro is more yellowish if youre into sunrisesunset photography this phone is not for youand me im heavy on google apps but there are ways so dont mind much its not having google play since last night couldnt open facebook and messenger
Huawei,nova Y90,if you received security update for dec do not install it my device got some bugs with the ap more huawei phones are pretty much worthless to buy these days instead of removing the jack they removed the micro sd card slot leaving the phone with only gb of internal memory that doesnt make sense to me when realme just released the realme with gb plus the micro sd card slot
Huawei,nova Y90,pray they use curved glass an oled display and better glass like something close to the kunlun glass
Huawei,nova Y90,good but more good if google service exit
Huawei,nova Y90,it defnitely is and its really more secure than google play and much more faster you get suc more if you received security update for dec do not install it my device got some bugs with the app hopefully next update it will be fixed still believe in huawei over all this device performs well
Huawei,nova Y90,works really good and appgallery is geting better each update it defnitely is and its really more secure than google play and much more faster you get such an better experience of downloading your apps
Huawei,nova Y90,can people stop talking about google play anyone can install that if its missing move on and more hello uhm sadly you cant install it onto certain huawei devices like minehuawei nova
Huawei,nova Y90,does it make use of google play sadly it doesnt runs on emui only the phones petformance isnt effected by it have one actually and im very happy with it the display looks like top of the range device defnitely worth the buy if you dont really care about having patience without the google experience
Huawei,nova Y90,yes dont seriously why would you waste your here in budget spec when you can bu more its actually not man gsm arena sometimes add wrong info its around
Huawei,nova Y90,which one better huawei or samsung
Huawei,nova Y90,does anyone has the same issue when after the update the device restart on itself
Huawei,nova Y90,honor but priced bit higher than this yes but the honor is device and it doesnt feel that much expensive compared to the nova se
Huawei,nova Y90,is there honor substitute for this honor but priced bit higher than this
Huawei,nova Y90,lmao no google services cant play multiplayer on most gamesany games which requires more have you ever used huawei device guess not if samsung nor iphone does this issue well huawei aint having that one and why am going to play on the device if have laptop im just regular phone user
Huawei,nova Y90,honor better
Huawei,nova Y90,why mega pixel front camera thats only the down side with huawei especially without google play store have psmart the front camera is bad
Huawei,nova Y90,does this phone have metal frame ye
Huawei,nova Y90,the major issue is with the delay in notifications push notifications arent working on more maybe this is system error try reseting the phone or update depending on witch app the notifications are slow
Huawei,nova Y90,ive been huawei user for long time now lot of regrets when bought this lots of more have this issue as well and we hope it will be fix by the update if it has one for the month the phone is actually good but it has some issues but guess we cant deny that all devices has error lets wait for huaweis move
Huawei,nova Y90,huawei is in its last legs no google play store or google services yet there not do more just bought this nova and swear its really good phone with no lags no hiccups no system down over all no issue no google service nah theres ton of apps that work with out google services you were lock on to google service thats why youre saying that lol huawei doesnt have this annoying ads no sd slot lol the way huawei can transfer datas to other device is the solution theres no way that you will go to your gallery rewatch the videos or view all the images all you just have to do is to transfer the datas lol
Huawei,nova Y90,no whyyyy ask us
Huawei,nova Y90,hi may ask if what is the model number of hw nova for philippines was not able to get the model number of but the available one has gb ram its actually good this is my second choice if wont be able to get the nova
Huawei,nova Y90,im in philippines too haha this is my new device and im ready to leave google serv more hi may ask if what is the model number of hw nova for philippines
Huawei,nova Y90,in my country ph its priced at im in philippines too haha this is my new device and im ready to leave google service soon
Huawei,nova Y90,this is quite monster device guessing its around having google remove from huawe more in my country ph its priced at
Huawei,nova Y90,worst is samsung collecting every single tap on the phone who needs hacker nowadays
Huawei,nova Y90,not going to lie that is true but if you want huawei with gms without any work more yes if people really wanna use huawei they have to let go google or else dont use huawei if yall gonna find gms anyway
Huawei,nova Y90,looks great the id and color
Huawei,nova Y90,but emui is better overall than magic ui even the latest versions of magic ui only looks simi more not going to lie that is true but if you want huawei with gms without any work around then honor is probably the best option if you really want type of huawei phone experience have nova plus and honoe they are both quiet similar but emui is still better that magic ui
Huawei,nova Y90,huawei is struggling to combat the us ban hope it goes back to the good old days when it wa more if you want that just go to honor their phones is exactly like modern huawei phones but with gms
Huawei,nova Y90,this is obviously based on android with the latest emui this is true since the plus has emui on android
Huawei,nova Y90,would be great but no google services and android also not amoled its like redmi note but worse
Huawei,nova Y90,there is nothing like series anymore the nova series is merging name to low budget series no hope for global huawei users
Huawei,nova Y90,there was absolutely no need for another honor rebrand one of those phones is bad enough actually no its regular rebranded with no ultrawide camera
Huawei,nova Y91,coming from huawei the phone is great in terms of battery life im still trying to drain mine till without charging im trying to dare to urge my self not to charge it when it reaches run nintendo emulation eden social media calls browsing did some editing battery still strong anyway for processor power its good for the games that play but in emulation gamehub will need lots of tweaking even in eden for game to play some games but not all cameras for me its good im not camera guy speakers mmh good think my ears have gone bad from earbuds
Huawei,nova Y91,after full os update install microg services then just download the apk and install it works better especially for gmail gbox didnt work as good as gspace but gspace is somewhat glitchy and buggy especially with gmail letters would be paused and never sent which made me lose an important interview google maps works like charm with the gigantic ah battery and energy efficient sd chipset gspace also didnt work well with tbi banks app where it fails to download invoices to be phone memory usb audio player pro didnt recognise my licence in gspace via google play store aside from that the phones incredible better display and speakers than honor pro who never did the white balance right for human photos and sold it having tried dozen phones keep coming back to to add esim just buy the full kit package of esim on aliexpress reddit has much info on that ber stopped working maybe they are out of business
Huawei,nova Y91,gspace will allow you to install and use google apps like maps and youtube it has an pop up option to apdate google play services once you signed into your google account
Huawei,nova Y91,hello please advise it has esim thanks no nova does not have esim support
Huawei,nova Y91,battery lifes phenomenal especially for such big screen kudos to gsmarena for presenting the phone display size in square cm days with light use its unheard of set the charging limit in battery health menu to percent and it lasts two days thats how will get years out of it sold the honor pro for the due to horror having inferior speakers inferior display tinted in yellowish green no matter what you do pwm giving me headache getting hot easily and having ah battery while the has ah spent week with both phones put professionally edited photos from high resolution sony camera in both to compare the screens that tint on the horror and uneven sharpness yuck didnt care if them crapoled is much brighter in sunlight the lcd was decent has awesome melodies especially the sunlit garden and bell for messages small tweaks in the os were also decisive like showing for how many seconds did the missed call ringand the automatic manager and so on used gspace to emulate google apps worked better for me than gbox since the phone comes without them got many other phones that do have them and still return to the huawei everytime
Huawei,nova Y91,what about battery life
Huawei,nova Y91,have trouble understanding the hate about this phone it is unique returned honor pro because of inferior speakers poor battery life smaller screen with fake crapoled colours and overall fragile look am pro photographer so always tuned out the best could and dont need the camera always carry one with me am light user zero gaming and get two days battery life charging it from and with full charge almost days even in eu roaming the big real estate of the screen makes it very enjoying to browse info and the orangeyellow menu and wallpaper colours are plain beautiful tried pura ultra in the store but have trouble seeing what more it can offer me since huawei phones are stuck on android with inferior soc nevertheless this is absolutely the best phone for me and get regular updates it was very hard week until get used and tweak everything was very sorry that bought it now just love it regularly use brave browser with some tabs opened and it does not slow down the huawei find and cloud stuff prefer them to googles solutions some clever software tweaks make this even more enjoyable like when it shows missed calls it informs you for how many seconds the phone ran also the builtin optimizer that asks you to delete junk from time to time unobtrusive cannot wait for the successor
Huawei,nova Y91,charge on mah battery thats terrible agree had this phone before and it was terrible the battery was so expanded and when the percentage is bellow it will power off dont know why tho
Huawei,nova Y91,this smartphone doesnt seem to have good performance but the design is good
Huawei,nova Y91,scored an incredible deal for the phone some guy bought it and sold it to me after few days the screen is very high quality especially the dark theme downloading apk files and installing them is breeze accubattery pro integrates with the os unlike on harmony os have tablet what is most impressive are the speakers loud and incredibly clear for the price there is bass also separation and detail way better than my htc could not believe it for the phone it is very comfortable in hand find the emui very intuitive and appreciate that there is slider to limit charging to most phones do not have as an option there are cheap matte screen protectors on aliexpress for dollars for piece set tried dozens and dozens of phones over the last two years live between the two malls in my city and nothing comes even close
Huawei,nova Y91,good phone all can see is good battery life but price is not good for its spec more difference is that huawei doesnt get the new ugly horrible android logo in the boot screen
Huawei,nova Y91,huawei nova is good phone in my opinion nice battery big screen one problem is the chipset not enough for that phone it can be helio or thats all
Huawei,nova Y91,was very disappointed when started using this phone yes you can download google apps fro more update gbox is great app where you can clone your apps it fools the service provider that your phone is an android device it enables you to make purchases and sign in with google account
Huawei,nova Y91,its not terrible
Huawei,nova Y91,if cell phones are better than any android why is huawei bankrupt huawei is bankruptyou are dreaming right the guys do not depend only on cell phones and also they have he most patents in cell phone industry
Huawei,nova Y91,be just bought new and cant even download appgallery so am just stuck in one place was more you shouldve bought samsung instead its miles better than huawei as samsung is the best of the best of the best
Huawei,nova Y91,sounds very much like exactly what im looking for bit unsure because it only comes in more cellc has the gb version of this phone
Huawei,nova Y91,huawei is supposed to be offering the first cell phone by the end of which works comp more huawei released mate pro yesterday with
Huawei,nova Y91,please dont go from an ultra to this thats gonna be big downgrade bought this phones as well am even typing this from this phone the price difference between the and nova is large the retails at in south africa and the retails at if had to compare price to the with the features this phone has am quite happy with this phone then especially if the price is times the price of this phone know comparing flag ship to is not really contest but the battery life of this phone in market like south africa which doesnt have such large option of cellphones to choose from this is really beast to the general population
Huawei,nova Y91,hi there from the sunny south africa got this phone for my wife and wow this is great ph more please dont go from an ultra to this thats gonna be big downgrade
Huawei,nova Y91,sd user here it doesnt stutter when browsing the screen or in any social media apps more thanks for taking the time to reply if it works that well on this phone too it would be good enough for me dont even play mobile games just lots of video streaming and spotify social mediabrowsingmaps so should be good enough for me now to only see if the battery is gonna be as solid as it suggests from the specs
Huawei,nova Y91,is this have nfc connection
Huawei,nova Y91,please share impressions on how the battery holds up as well as the speakers and smoothness of more sd user here it doesnt stutter when browsing the screen or in any social media apps can also play casual games like mobile legends with ultra settings call of duty with very high settings but medium fps genshin impact at low setting fps but you can also set it at high settings but you need to set the render resolution to medium or high
Huawei,nova Y91,why waste money with netflixhbospotify etcthere are so many movie flix apps that you can do more if cell phones are better than any android why is huawei bankrupt
Huawei,nova Y91,well not at all what was expecting do not waste your money on this phone the majority of more why waste money with netflixhbospotify etcthere are so many movie flix apps that you can download for free and from there you can watch thousands of movieshuawei phones are way better than samsung or xiaomiopporealme etc
Huawei,nova Y91,at only euros got mine for euros this phone is not at all waste of money on the contrary not too big not too heavy you can also have all the google apps if you know how to download them just love this device
Huawei,nova Y91,and heavy weight also gr prefer phone with mahand with less than grs yes let direct to inch mah mobile phone page then say it is too big and heavy
Huawei,nova Y91,too big and pocket unfriendly and heavy weight also gr prefer phone with mahand with less than grs
Huawei,nova Y91,this phones are unlocked network it can ship to kiribati
Huawei,nova Y91,copy paste of enjoy
Huawei,nova Y91,thats not right actually this phone is in way better value but if you really want to buy ph more way better value lol check the specs again
Huawei,nova Y91,get the samsung if youre thinking of spending your money on this thats basica more thats not right actually this phone is in way better value but if you really want to buy phone in this price range you should go for the poco pro or realme gt pro
Huawei,nova Y91,sad no google play services man did you ever heard about gbox app no then give it try will solve your tiny problem with google services but honestly huawei harmony is way better
Huawei,nova Y91,huawei can close shop as soon as possible no google services no fm radio man like its difficult to install gbox from huawei store it wuill give you nice android inside plus all the google services its not difficult by the way if you never tried harmony you cant say no google services maybe if you give it try you find out its better than having google inside for radio you can also install from huawei app galery no needed to have it onboard because its likely same buy radio transmitter or portable radio problem solved haha
Huawei,nova Y91,usd
Huawei,nova Y91,is this the same identical enjoy that no one has seen on earth this the global version of huawei enjoy launched with emui not harmony os guess
Huawei,nova Y91,doubt charging is my wife has huawei nova which is very old and even that has charging huawei chargers have been around long time now and theyre cheaper than the chargers so im guessing this will have charging
Huawei,nova Y91,huawei nova se same snapdragon have charging
Huawei,nova Y91,with mah charging hours need why so atupid production minimum mustbe
Huawei,nova Y91,mah battery with just wstts charging wow
Huawei,nova Y91,closing in on inch
Huawei,nova Y91,omg if only if it has oled display would definitely buy it because of wider display
Huawei,P smart 2020,great phone but wont log on to ebaycouk its android emui screen says im either power user not or java script disabled or ghostery or noscript stopping java any ideas
Huawei,P smart 2020,was satisfied but broke screen
Huawei,P smart 2020,my signal strength is low how do improve it can only make calls at some particular places
Huawei,P smart 2020,will this phone get an upgrade to android lot of huawei phones from never received software updates most of them are stuck on android
Huawei,P smart 2020,it has google thats it phones that dont are ypp series and everything after that stop confusing people with wrong info in the comments if you dont know
Huawei,P smart 2020,im confused now how come this phone comes with google services think its because it runs on emui software systems below emui can use google services if this were to run on say emui this wouldnt have google services which explains why their newer phones dont use google
Huawei,P smart 2020,purchased this phone in july for the first few weeks could barely use the wifi at home it got better at some point but after the last software update in early december the connection is extremely instable again can not recommend this phone
Huawei,P smart 2020,those who comment about huawey smart that do not have the services google play theyre just liars have this phone it works well hes got all the services those who claim otherwise are only malevolent
Huawei,P smart 2020,good upgrade from the model yes
Huawei,P smart 2020,dont no what people are on about ive just bought the smart if you take time to read the specs properly you see quite clearly it comes with google play services installed my opinion excellent phone
Huawei,P smart 2020,thats right mysterious huawei phone aka huawei smart no google play services variant more thats right both of you
Huawei,P smart 2020,what how the smart has no google play services but they stole alphabet incorporate more thats right mysterious huawei phone aka huawei smart no google play services variant appeared on geekbench
Huawei,P smart 2020,older version than my phone that thrown away
Huawei,P smart 2020,they cannot put the google play services on phone with mediatek the contract with google sa more your expertise is no longer valid and huawei new phones with android emui google play services huawei pro new edition release june chipset kirin nm and would add that kirin is one of the most successful bestselling and very reliable processor that works great kirin old announcement date or days old your panties are older
Huawei,P smart 2020,so instead of ordinary old kirin they can use dimensity gt more they cannot put the google play services on phone with mediatek the contract with google says that the service is provided exclusively for phones with some characteristics that are already old such as the kirin processor measurements and others huawei tries to change what is not written in the contract before the ban such as putting other camera configurations and putting more ram memory
Huawei,P smart 2020,good reason to use old chipset low specs with high price with being kirin be more you just read the specifications for device and comment that the kirin is old only years old and as it is not valid it indicates that you do not have such device that uses this chip kirin which is proven to be good and fast enough without lag in processing own an honor and say great phone without any flaws and they have the best huawei honor support of any other brand as didnt contact you but guy who wasnt clear about google services and have enough experience with huawei and honor devices so dont need your guess and assumptions
Huawei,P smart 2020,because they use chipset kirin and proved to be good and was made at time when there more so instead of ordinary old kirin they can use dimensity gt of mediatek with google play
Huawei,P smart 2020,not bad but using micro usb in is just provocative
Huawei,P smart 2020,it better with the series
Huawei,P smart 2020,microusb android actually to have google play services it needs older software so don more it will have usb type
Huawei,P smart 2020,huawei pack well let me pass xaiomi all the way
Huawei,P smart 2021,best experience ever actually im writing this comment on the psmart ive had since more from dezember have this phone and still use myp years and everything is smoot nice and easy
Huawei,P smart 2021,nice smart phone
Huawei,P smart 2021,yeahive been maining it for the last years and hate the thing that google play or google doesnt work proprellyi dont reccomend this dumb thing gamingthe worst performance ive ever seeni have mained galaxy and it was better than this its just bad please dont get this as main phone please
Huawei,P smart 2021,it lasts the whole day gaming and doing other stuff its good you must have dust on your cam
Huawei,P smart 2021,wouldnt advice people to buy this phonethis phone is badthe camera is very bad yet they say mp yet its mphate the camerathe battery drains very fastthe only thing good about this phone is the storage and network onlybuy this phone at your own risk
Huawei,P smart 2021,thats good phone for daily usage and playing some light games there isnt much overheating while playing like exynos or mediatek processors at the same range impressive battery life it can hold up for more than hours of continuously use at screen brightness thing didnt like about this phone the first thing it doesnt support google services secondly the camera performance isnt satisfying theres dynamic range issue at all light conditions and photos colors looks too faded poor color saturation
Huawei,P smart 2021,have been using the phone since and its still working perfectly battery can still last more mine got the same same year but the battery has already given upit switches off on or any percent it feels like
Huawei,P smart 2021,here on its arguably contains dual sim but once bought very same modela genuine one which was single sim what could be the reason for that
Huawei,P smart 2021,the most apps that cannot be loaded in the huawei market can be loaded via internet brow more got waze to work without installing gbox and such simply went at the settings and chose to log in with the username email
Huawei,P smart 2021,not bad piece of equipment however it has its shortfalls have hearing impairment so use hearing aids which are supposed to link to the smartphone via direct audio streaming so as when calls are received the hearing aids work as bluetooth pods unfortunately the psmart does not offer direct audio streaming does not support google play services which is required to run the hearing aids so when the phone rings have to remove the hearing aid to answer the call this is all time consuming and if drop that hearing aid and it gets damaged it costs more than times more than the phone this was my first huawei but unfortunately also my last time to return to samsung or iphone
Huawei,P smart 2021,owsome and best phone
Huawei,P smart 2021,have problems with google play download gspace its free
Huawei,P smart 2021,main camera not good selfie camera is worse has good battery privacy is good app gallery is boring this phone should just be removed from the market
Huawei,P smart 2021,my biggest problem with this phone is that whenever upload dp or post status on whatsapp the photo loses it quality and looks really horrible specifically photos taking with huawei smart
Huawei,P smart 2021,completely useful
Huawei,P smart 2021,huawei without google is nothing not useful at all lot of apps are not supported my workin with all google feature just find on net all app apk download hehe tel is amazing
Huawei,P smart 2021,im currently using this device its decent phone not the best not the worst for it to work better you need to download aurora store it works better than app gallery as you all know app gallery doesnt have so many apps you can download every app which is available on google play store even though some of the doesnt work they need google play services to work but most of them they work
Huawei,P smart 2021,cant make outgoing calls texts or use mobile data when im out so too when im at home on the wifi im still not able to make outgoing calls or text so there is no need to use mobile data but im able to use whatsapp messenger this has been an issue since the th september ive done what have done since ive made formal complaints to id mobile ive said when im available to talk but they call me back when im unavailable due to work commitments now they have said my next bill payment is due th october when all my unlimited minutes texts and of data is still unused what else can do im in year contract which ends july have the huawei smart
Huawei,P smart 2021,this is good average phone there is nothing super about it the design is awkward
Huawei,P smart 2021,use huawei smart but cant recommend it for anyone this phone is not good at more have problems with google play
Huawei,P smart 2021,motorola or huawei smart use huawei smart but cant recommend it for anyone this phone is not good at all it is very slow to download some apps arent available without google huawei really struggling
Huawei,P smart 2021,google apps work if you download old versions dec not playstore chrome gmail maps youtube etc those work
Huawei,P smart 2021,most useless phone in the world got lost using their gps wish didnt get more should it then even be called smart what smart features are users going to indulge with
Huawei,P smart 2021,when will this phone get emui or hos any information
Huawei,P smart 2021,this phone should be called smart since it was released in
Huawei,P smart 2021,where to start if your want google play stay away from this it doesnt let you download half of the content as google play does it can also be bit laggy iv been using it for almost year now in the beginning it was fine iv added nothing new to it so its the same as it was when bought it think the updates have slowed it down to be fair also the keyboard im having an issue with you really have to press on them to show up or hit them twice overall would buy it again dont think would my son has the smart and theres no lag in it whatsoever
Huawei,P smart 2021,my review of the smart used for full year before upgrading to the xiaomi first of all the phone does not have google services which already is disadvantage the display can get pretty bright not gonna lie but it isnt enough brightness for it to be exposed to broad daylight the display can be seen properly indoors or in lower light since the viewing angles suffer and its not very bright in broad daylight the haptics for the keyboard doesnt really exist it wont let me and the only one that could turn on was to vibrate the navigation keys it is quite aggressive or so when it comes to vibrate on touch not soft reassuring vibration but ill cut it some slack since this launched at dollars avaliable for like performance the chip has decent performance overall unless it is related to heavy tasks like gaming tested gaming on some applications since call of duty mobile didnt work but noticed that there would be fps drops and also quite lot of lag and it would get warm it gets hot while charging the phones gaming capabilities would be consistently poor if you were to play on max graphics on some games that require lot of processing at its best for me this phone on antutu benchmark lite had score of usually at but now for the cameras the phones camera quality is quite decent with lot of light however it has significant weakness that will be noticable dynamic range the selfie camera feels quite unusable dynamic range also just tanks and drops whne using portrait mode on the selfie cam you can see grain and they are usable but noticably average or below average in quality for most people the main camera has better dynamic range than the selfie camera that has horrific dynamic range but the main camera seems to have fixed focus at the center when zooming in you will see the center is detailed and sharp while going away from the center you will notice softness and not so detailed parts if you try to focus on the dark parts tho the dynamic range once again drops and would prefer more natural bluish sky but most of the time it feels quite processed in low light the photos definitely feel like in the camp of brighter for the sake of being brighter but however theres grain not lot ofdetail and once again poor dynamic range when it comes to this phone when it comes to low light performance it is consistently poor in detail speakers have noticeable distortion at their maximum the fingerprint scanner is decent and quite fast the video watching experience takes hit since the phone has no google applications you will have to search up different app or maybe knock offs of youtube the screen glass scratches easily for me there are multiple scratches at level and deeper ones at level so put screen protector razor blade can scratch the screen bit so you should get screen protector the phones has plastic frame and back that imitates glass but is made out of plastic the phone is also quite thick battery life however is not weakness one of its strengths in fact and have finished days with percent left my verdict is that there are better devices at this price point the phone for my area costs dollars recommend buying poco or redmi instead since they have google services and they have quite better photos or the redmi note if you spend more if you spend even more tho get the redmi note
Huawei,P smart 2021,the phone does not meet expectations new phone with an old processor its disappointing the device was released in its midrange not highend device after allyou cant expect the latest best components
Huawei,P smart 2021,ip
Huawei,P smart 2021,got this as replacement to prime which was an allrounder for great ux one needs to exhibit developer persona loading apps which are google based is definite problem because it was designed to run without google services so have learnt to explore new apps that deliver the same as had on google services its daunting task but since had it the journey is one youd have to be adventurous most apks will not run properly but keep on fishing for ones that work the battery is awesome and complemented by superfast charging if you have battery draining apps
Huawei,P smart 2021,huawei smart is good phone but the battery running so fast no playstore
Huawei,P smart 2021,just read many have founded on youtube all tutorials to install and use google also here im sure you will find it
Huawei,P smart 2021,use the phone myself great phone but the lag google play is big problem would never had signed my contract if knew google is not supported use gmb and and in my business sovety dissapointed and would love to get out of this contract but now im stuck cant wait to get samsung or any other phone never again will huawei see me

Huawei,P smart 2021,recently purchased smart and months down the line it just went off while on charg more try with the correct charger because it is possible that the cable is broken and your battery is discharged if you did not restart while the phone is updating then you will not be able to turn it on so it is best to go to any service or mobile store to reinstall new android system will not cost more than eur
Huawei,P smart 2021,purpose of this phone it same as ya from chipset camera ram rom size and battery yes is ya
Huawei,P smart 2021,getting harmony os
Huawei,P smart 2021,can someone assist cannot read my mms

Huawei,P smart 2021,no it wont work normally also the fingerprint login wont work normally nothing more just download dualspace and you have access to google play store
Huawei,P smart 2021,without google whats the best app store to use apkstore

Huawei,P smart 2021,the phone is waterproof
Huawei,P smart 2021,great phone indeed with the mighty battery ever mah plus amazing cameras and the screen re more the huawei ya is great phone but dont think it would threaten the new galaxy with its one ui android and its mighty mah battery

Huawei,P smart 2021,lte cat mbitsupload mbitsdownload

Huawei,P smart 2021,trash crashes auto correct cant be turnd oof not alowed to write correctle in other laun more is this some newly composed indian slang
Huawei,P smart 2021,guys any way of installing google services directly on this without virtual machine apps
Huawei,P smart 2021,amazing device love it bitz
Huawei,P smart 2021,so why didnt huawei then give us kirin chipsets in the ya one of the best huawei phone with long lasting batteryamazing camera and its just sweet
Huawei,P smart 2021,very strange no this must be old processer they decided to use had great phone indeed with the mighty battery ever mah plus amazing cameras and the screen resolution is amazing
Huawei,P smart 2021,have same problem whats the reasons for this notifications lock screen notifications mark show more notifications settings thurn on screen when are recived and flash light
Huawei,P smart 2021,hi am so nervouse didnt get notifications of many app of my phone do you have problem more have same problem whats the reasons for this
Huawei,P smart 2021,does it come with gservices no thats the point
Huawei,P smart 2021,been living with this phone now for months no google love it
Huawei,P smart 2021,can it record videos there are some websites that says it can but im not sure if it more it doesnt have option on my camera tho
Huawei,P smart 2021,huawei smart is so great hope it comes to south africa we need this phone it will for sure and it will sold alot because people just see the shape man
Huawei,P smart 2021,mp selfie no improvements no nfc dont see any use of the mp rear camera
Huawei,P smart 2021,my view is that the kirin processor is good but for the other specifications it looks like they took few steps back model is with glass and aluminum but model is with cheap plastic then no nfc and wifi connection without ghz or ghz and without antennas mimo and its lte cat instead of cat then no gyroscope and without screen protection somehow seems unattractive to mei stay on the honor which is farfar better
Huawei,P smart 2021,the kirin is nm because its not manufactured by tsms huawei because of the us more not all nodes are created equally nm tsmc was superior to nm by samsung nm tsmc was once again superior to samsungs nm remember that nm is more marketing term example samsung nm nm is much alike its barely improvement and to be fair it should maybe not even been called nm nm
Huawei,P smart 2021,smart kirin ghz cortexa ghz cortexa nm smart kirin ax ghz cortexa ghz cortexa nm gj huawei
Huawei,P smart 2021,no nfc this is the problem off this equiment
Huawei,P smart 2021,no sad cus it would be great phone nope you can get almost all you need apps from petal search
Huawei,P smart 2021,kirin again they get nowhere with nm processors in huawei was banned from america which is why they keep making kirin chipsets
Huawei,P smart 2021,body plastic or aluminium
Huawei,P smart 2021,how does this compare to the poco
Huawei,P smart 2021,phone worse than mate in chipset cpu cores but gpu is worse yet more power efficient score to each imo so its tied
Huawei,P smart 2021,mediatek is better more efficient and they make nm chip chips that are cost effective and fast yes the mediatek chips with more modern arm cores are indeed better but they are also using same nm so the ones using exact same cores would be same uwu
Huawei,P smart 2021,never thought anybody will care about that in it matters when cell service is down fm radio provides resilient way of broadcasting information in an emergency
Huawei,P smart 2021,kirin processors are already optimized enough for daily drivers and most games as well its wa more mediatek is better more efficient and they make nm chip chips that are cost effective and fast
Huawei,P smart 2021,lastest phone so adorable love it
Huawei,P smart 2021,despite the specifications design wise looks promising
Huawei,P smart 2021,wow another kirin how many kirin chip they have
Huawei,P smart 2021,galaxy already had ghz wifi holy sht very strange no this must be old processer they decided to use had
Huawei,P smart 2021,no fm radio why idk
Huawei,P smart 2021,no ghz wifi in pathetic galaxy already had ghz wifi holy sht
Huawei,P smart 2021,huawei prime stkl also known as huawei smart ya plus osandroid emui
Huawei,P smart 2021,only thing left in stock sorry
Huawei,P smart 2021,are you poor no but wont stop you from spending on phone with shady kirin and trash camera setup when you can get better

Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,phone is bargain at dollars lol same chip as my from being sold now for more the chip alone is not the only thing on the phone that decide value uwu
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,new edition lol do you think huawei would do this if the us ban was not in place they are doing this for reason and that is rereleasing phones with new names because of the ban
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,what is that release date this phone is avilable in my country from month and the old edition from month
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,abdulkadiran feb display type newips lcd capacitive touchscreen colors old more new edition lol
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,android is coming to this phone some phones have already received it
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,yes and thats why it have not android version exactly and this is why it will not see any further android updates so no android update here
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,it has google service huawei use old license to release this phone with google services yes and thats why it have not android version
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,ive got one and can tell you that it is slow compared to the pocophone
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,and again the same phonetheyd better lower the prices of their existing phones if they want to sell old phones
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,huawei became like samsung in the old days lots of models instead of few models just look onep more what are you talking about this phone is bargain it gets released at such low price because huawei is being boycotted hard by google and their reputation is getting hurt severely this is one of the if not the best phone at this pricerange samsung phones all use amoled and work at phone repair shope and most phones screen break are amoled screen they are more to damage
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,is it joke its and now again kirin no difference between previous and this one just memory and camera
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,display type newips lcd capacitive touchscreen colors old ltps ips lcd capacitive touchscreen colors memory newufs old emmc
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,the os is already outdated and the battery capacity is bit small
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,no super amoled display no gorilla glass protection no hdr no android no ufs price for all these features wow huawei think with the usa other countries should also need to ban huawei
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,essentially the nova with mp main camera and gb rom
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,whats the difference
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,lolz new edition what exactly is new price there is no noticeable difference are you kidding huawei
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,nearly times the price of the old one and the difference is this one is for china only the base storage is and its ufs instead of emmc and nothing else
Huawei,P30 lite New Edition,new edition with old cpu nice
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,the auto brightness doesnt show any solutions update to emui and you are good to go
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,this phone can find ant to buy new piece
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,got it since and till now never think to replace it screen not single scratch even after drop it for so many times under rugged casing but no screen protection bcoz they are annoying still feel this guy is as fresh as new amazing no feature but so far didnt the need as of now
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,there are very small changes not just the colours the periscope lens are just difference
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,same as pro there are very small changes not just the colours
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,google services work on this phone but it will always have android what people here say more there are rumoued that emui will have either android or
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,does google services work on it yes
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,yes there is android have been using it for months now does google services work on it
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,aside from the new colors of the phone how will know if its the new edition or not will more only by the box or if you install an app that tells you which type of storage you are using if its ufs then its new edition
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,thought the specs between the old huwaei pro and new edition had to be the same but this one has faster ufs storage compared to on the old pro model this will make the phone much more responsive
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,please does anyone know if this phone is likely to have an upgrade to android yes there is android have been using it for months now
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,does this for sure have google services think when came here before it said it doesnt have it yes it does have it since it was released before the huawei ban also someone know has the phone so no doubt it has gsm
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,non pro new edition would be an instant buy me as cant find any other smar more lite new edition got ya covered
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,autofocus on the selfie camera will never happen huawei pro has selfie camera with af
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,hi has anybodi tried the phone yet can you tell me have they managed to put an autofocus on more autofocus on the selfie camera will never happen
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,you get more gb extra ram and gb extra storage plus they couldnt change to much or more dont know what kind of world are you living it but what you say is not true and irrelevant first of all you dont get gb extra ram and gb storage this option was already on previous original model so again nothing has been changed never used iphone and will never use but lets be honest when they bring new phone which is similar previous one they changes nearly everything inside sometimes outside either iphone iphone they all look same but also very different what huawei did is shame for tech company introducing phone as new but exact same as predecessor model they could say version version whatever but not new one this is scam this is cheating
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,same phone as previous pro but euro expensiver you pay that price for new edit more you get more gb extra ram and gb extra storage plus they couldnt change to much or would have needed approving and that would meant usa making them take google services off phone but how much do apple charge for extra storage on their phones should imagine without looking lot more than huawei should apple be banned and charged and lets not even get into apple deliberately restricting peoples phones
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,when will it be available in ireland
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,charging full price for one little upgrade thats not worth it
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,ufs version of rom storage thats why faster than ufs you really dont read the comment do you also im waiting on new revision ufs still doesnt make it worth it
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,new revision what do you mean by that fyi do know about the faster storage ple more ufs version of rom storage thats why faster than ufs
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,jul cause its faster storage and new revision do you even understand how tech works new revision what do you mean by that fyi do know about the faster storage please explain your new revision you know since you know tech and all
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,what about middle east when can pre order this phone why would you even want this lmao makes no sense to purchase this might as well go for original pro since it is the same phone but way cheaper and its already available
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,uhhmmsamsung products are stopped making by china by its made in vietnam or india more either way hisher point is still correct and heshe technically isnt wrong samsung did manufacture their devices in china
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,for minor feature you have to pay euro what joke

Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,hahahahah you should know that the majority of the phones are made in china and even if the more oh boycott china product oh trash china product how muvh can bet their furniture is from china
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,can somebody explain to me what is the difference of the old huawei pro to this new huawei more for the base model go vs go ufs vs an additional year of software updates ne more likely to get android is it worth it in my opinion absolutely not you can get last years pro for almost less
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,why some huawei phones have google services and some dont there is global version or international version which have global rom and also there is only chinese version global version have google but chinese ones dont this was before the us ban but now even global version may not have google cervices unless if you side load the google apk files
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,does the old pro have huawei services hsm or google services gsm both running gms becoz both using kirin
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,its for sale here in england now already available in bulgaria
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,anyone know when this edition is going to be on ee with the watch
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,google play services explain they both have gms the main difference software wise is the ne comes with emui out of the box which the regular ppro will receive anyway this month globally and hardware wise think the ne comes with ufs instead of and gb of memory anyway the regular ppro is blazing fast yes have it and im not sure if in the nl at least paying more for the ne edition would be worth it
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,think there is something nit correct its optical zoom this time on this new edition more no it is optical zoom and hybrid zoom the optical zoom is on pro plus
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,doesnt seem to be available to buy in uk no buy button on page only option to notify
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,huawei is making superb and superior devices great job
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,should wait for this or get the old huawei pro now wait for it the new one mate

Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,cant dispute it has been great and still is waiting to have it in the kenyan market
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,only the name sounds new nothing else
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,its coming with android will it be upgradable to android beyond
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,its have android no android pie
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,does huawei also have affordable and solid phones for making calls so not for browsing and playing
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,huawei would be making the best phones in the market if they had google play services
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,having google services availability in pro new edition is going wonderful
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,will the new edition pro comes with no it does not come with
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,if they update the camera ram and refresh rate im in currently using my mate pro which more theres just more ram and ufs or what again do you want bros
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,wifi ax is must have wifi ax
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,having ppro coming to the end of my contract upgrading to ppro without google apps isnt an option upgrading to pro isnt enough of change so was going to go sim only or find different manufacturer an updated version of the pro means can consider huawei again
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,optical camera vertical zoom scroll in landscape or no deal like they need you to make deal
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,sadly it will probably have nonreplaceable battery this is pity heres why httpseneverybodywikicombenefitsofuserreplaceablebatteries
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,theres just more ram and ufs thats great it will be faster and more storage and with gps to

Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,yeah thats true just bought ys yesterday and dont like the earpiece inside it doesnt more why buy such cheap phone then ever heard of you get what you paid for stop complaining
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,give it hifi quad dac audio quality and take my money
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,think that this is just rebranded pro just with more ram and ufs storage because the normal pro has only gb of ram while new version has gb of ram and the normal one also only had ufs rather than the ufs on the new version
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,nice huawei se
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,whats new lol google play services

Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,another good product by huwawi ppro better than
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,mm like that it has super quality cameras oled display and real flagship performance love it
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,keep dreaming huawei would rather try to replace gms than to rerelease their flagship phone more this phone will see daylight and it will be very soon specifications are certain except memory options
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,lol what is this
Huawei,P30 Pro New Edition,new colors available family member colors
Huawei,P40 4G,whats the latest emui version on the
Huawei,P40 4G,decent performanceit still have good battery in use gspace so no google services issues still receiving updates get security update of april
Huawei,P40 4G,nice but too expensive since samsung and xiaomi have better offers at reasonable price
Huawei,P40 4G,nice phone sha
Huawei,P40 4G,got google sideloaded how did you do that
Huawei,P40 4G,without google these phones are nothing got google sideloaded
Huawei,P40 4G,all phone companies have completely given up battery capacity of less than but huawei tw more tell that to apple xd
Huawei,P40 4G,flagship processors cpu configurations it goes all the way back to when qualcomms more what are you on about snapdragon xx series
Huawei,P40 4G,apple is not using android isnt it huawei uses harmony os oh wait harmony os is an more not google play store sorry old kirin
Huawei,P40 4G,my friend bought this phone for very specific reason the camera now in my opinion this more bro if you need camera buy camera not mobilephone with camera
Huawei,P40 4G,yeah no wrong not everyone is enslaved to google get it agree with this not everyone but most of the people outside of china guess huawei will survive the competition outside of china without most of the people
Huawei,P40 4G,what about apple they never released phone with battery over mah apple is not using android isnt it huawei uses harmony os oh wait harmony os is an android also its prank
Huawei,P40 4G,why even bother launching why cant huawei provide access to apps that require google framework and deal with real stuff we get the whole ban thing we can cheat our way through it and they know that but if they want to stick to their useless economic system wont even buy another phone from them its tiring writing from my pro which is great camera phone with nice performance but isnt the only one im using due to this very problem
Huawei,P40 4G,unfortunately yes hoped so much that harmony will be something ground breaking but it seems more actually never had any hopes for harmony os it obviously proved itself as gimmick communication through all divices from the same brand aka apples thing is quite the ideality but its not all in this case huawei got more than enough to improve first so many apps are unavailable in their app gallery ive installed the gms perfectly fine but logging inside apps that require this google framework will cause just errors huawei seriously needs to stop playing and if they want to be global needs to get this thing going phone specs and superb cameras allegedly worth nothing without proper hardware
Huawei,P40 4G,feel bad for huawei theyre just going to disappear harmony os literally nothing unfortunately yes hoped so much that harmony will be something ground breaking but it seems its not in my country there is huge number of ps and mate for sale at low prices and people still stay away from them too bad because they are better than samsung and especially xiaomi
Huawei,P40 4G,only people who doesnt know anything about the advancement of the technology will complain out of people you will be very lucky if of them knows the specs of their phone they only know the model year for sure and even become reluctant to tell if its model is already year older
Huawei,P40 4G,leave it to huawei to copy the worst things with apple phones might have still considered more not even of consumers care about that stuff still nice try
Huawei,P40 4G,lol clearly fanboy if it wasnt problem with gms than why ren zhengfei is negotiati more im speaking for myself dont have problem with the absence of gms you can post your nonsensical comments all you want it wont change my mind and my habits ive had pro since it came out and no issues whatsoever stay upset nice terrible argumentation btw shows how upset you are over people having different opinion sadlyf
Huawei,P40 4G,it has google android on it no google services though just the os
Huawei,P40 4G,phone not infected by google it has google android on it
Huawei,P40 4G,nope sad comment can use my pro just fine without gms educate yourself lol clearly fanboy if it wasnt problem with gms than why ren zhengfei is negotiating so much with biden to have gms back but there is no point in explaining anything to fanboy you people are just useless useless than piece of toilet paper what does education have to do with phone your sad because you dont accept when someone else talks the truth about phone with half function and old os harmony is the same thing but with different name the truth is out there but like said fanboy never accepts anything even if it slaps their face sure the phone works perfect for instagram and facebook but for other apps its simply useless and the examples can be found all over the internet plus with the latest updates they messed up the front facing camera video recording lot you need to educated yourself to open your mind and not be another sheep like you are now only someone that is not fanboy can accept the problems that product is facing your nickname is even more obvious that you are fanboy
Huawei,P40 4G,huawei oops forgot about the
Huawei,P40 4G,you are just another huawei fanboy that doesnt understand that not google is the problem more nope sad comment can use my pro just fine without gms educate yourself
Huawei,P40 4G,wish huawei change display to hz
Huawei,P40 4G,android when google is already working on android
Huawei,P40 4G,you dont know anything about advanced mobilephonesgps its only for nerds who don more wait are you working for huawei lol but srs great job on the design
Huawei,P40 4G,without play services the os will be like android yeah no wrong not everyone is enslaved to google get it
Huawei,P40 4G,model number says it all not bad phone at all but whitout gms is what
Huawei,P40 4G,hold up this phone is making me crack up huawei theoretically could ask qualcomm to make the chip for them and sell it to them since qualcomm is allowed to sell chips to huawei well played huawei ill be waiting for pro
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,used the version since and im not in hurry to replace it batter its holding whole day with no problem with ot of usageif not it lasts daysw charging had chance for new phone with my provider signed new deal and couldve get new phone but instead got new tv dont wnat to jinx itbut the phone is perfectcamera sometimes it need second to focusbut if touch the screen it ill focus immediatelyfor google gboxourplaymicrog
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,the problem with this phone and the standard lite is the embarrassing display touch sampli more use lite and never had problems with sluggish screen just tested the screen and is the max was if could would put screenshot
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,fm radio nop
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,now use this cell phone work we and fast camera pro mode very good and high resolutions mode perfect volte mode work but update your cell for last version firmwares good feedback this is my personal opinion
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,been using my huawei lite for years now love this phone its fast no unnecessary google bloatware so still have tons of space just dont like the camera that much as it struggles to fokus
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,the huawie lite is the best mobile phone have seen the only cons is that there is no more download the happy mod app and microg app and install google applications
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,the front camera frustrates me it is sooo blurry and weather you have the beaty on or off it makes no difference want to cry especially if your backroound is white the front camera is the worst
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,was thinking of dumping google anyway had tryed disabling google apps on my huawei mate pro and found there was replacement google maps is working fine but use tomtom amigo sterling bank have app on huawei store outlook works fine for gmail and hotmail yes know its old account from when was kid newpipe works for youtube brave browser works grate as browser or microsoft edge deezer for music is on huawei app store generally all the old apps work fine if not on app store get them from apk pure as well alot of apps are identical to the website like rightmove or gympass
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,build quality is horrible literally look at it and its scratched
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,hi you can still download play store in if it doesnt have just search on youtube how do you download play store
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,hi group need some help have lite and im just wandering wheather should keep it or is there update to upgrade
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,love the phone but sadly wish there was uk alternative to google pay could use also use gmail which doesnt work properly images issues battery and speed are great it looks beautiful in my eyes at least but without google services it is incomplete many apps just dont work as they should which is real shame so at the moment it stays at home while rely on my redmi whilst out and about fix the nfc payment issue would be over the moon
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,only thing that lets the phone down is the browser its slow
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,phone is easy to use nice size screen battery life is sound got days use before had to charg more hi you can still download play store in if it doesnt have just search on youtube
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,great phone in the middlelow range the big advantage compared with the xiaomi and samsung eq more who needs spyware google install aptoide nad you will be ok remember gms drains lot of battery
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,no such pain for updates just buy another brand if you want playstore hawuie not worth more how do you put playstore on this handset also what about harmony coming to this phone too or is it going to stay on android
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,it is available cant manage to enable it tried with this phone and mate pro
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,continuation have it for week and its awesome works great battery is awesome when full more im using the phone and im enjoying it care to share how to sideload google in this phone
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,have bought this device recently continuation have it for week and its awesome works great battery is awesome when fully charged can last days on normal use for now im running wo google but will be sideloading it later on still stuck on emui antutu score is varies in
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,hi everyone im interested in reverse charge is available in this phone or mistake it is available
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,you should read the full tc of device with google services most people havent done it more please what are the main benefits of the phone without google play services to the users thank you
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,this was completely bad decision on my part shoud have done lot more research before up more think that this can still be used like any other phone you can still download apps and music or whatever no app that saw said app not available for this device so dont see any kind of problem with the phone
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,without google app still great like it because of in cheaper price charging is supper fast full battery from low to full in minutes
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,hello wich is best huawei lite or xiaomi mi lite the specs are the same and in more hello believe that the hz screen of the xiaomi is going to make the difference in day to day use and going the xiaomi route give you google services out of the box am currently using huawei mate pro and am really pleased with the quality that huawei offers but unfortunately believe is an unnecessary hussle to try to get play services or have other limitations
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,this phone offering much better processor than snapdragon exynos for this price it worth alot
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,according to huawei technician this phone does not support sa dont buy it do you mean for south africa
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,see this message from nony moustelling us that google play store can be side loaded more httpsapkpurecom
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,you could side load the play store and use without no issues see this message from nony moustelling us that google play store can be side loaded to all of us humans who dont talk tech could someone explain what that means and how you do it
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,have use huawei mate till now and can say it is smoother than iphone after ios updat more what does that have to do with this phone
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,logically the lack of google services must make it cheaper not astronomically expensive for more is nothing compare to phone like that is in romania
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,can still pair my phone with smart tv to play youtube content on my phone on tv yes as long as your smart tv is connected to the same network works like charm httpsconsumerhuaweicomukcommunitydetailsbhuaweipprodusingyoutubeyoutubevancedontopicid
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,the version is more expensive has more premium build slightly better camera slightly more logically the lack of google services must make it cheaper not astronomically expensive for mid range phone
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,most social media apps can be replaced by replaced by browser link if its not in the app galle more ewwww this isnt windows phone just buy good phone hawuie on way out
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,the lite comes with an oled screen and side fingerprint sensor unlike its smaller bro more no oled screenits ltps lcd
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,actually recommend you to try youtube vanced its much better than the official app more can still pair my phone with smart tv to play youtube content on my phone on tv
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,howzit got choice of either getting lite or lite or wanna know any more the version is more expensive has more premium build slightly better camera slightly faster processor and capability the lite has magnificent battery life plastic back and is lighter to handle both share the same super fast charging the screen on the lite is marginally larger the quality is excellent and comparable on both phones would still prefer the lite or lite over the lite anytime havent tried the lite edition but it should be comparable to the edition if youre on budget go for the lite the lack of gms has its advantages especially its heavy toll on the battery apps are location dependent in the app gallery it is much richer in asia and the mena region compared to europe in any case you wont find issues with social media apps
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,your complaint some apps get closed suddenly seems somewhat arbitrary is there more how can you possibly make phone like this and no google play then its useless infant wanted to go for the phone but no google play discouraged me cant use phone without google play
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,useless without google services and some apps get closed suddenly not recommended your complaint some apps get closed suddenly seems somewhat arbitrary is there specific app in mind have you ever used this phone to begin with
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,isnt the lite planned for review anytime soon
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,so basically this is huawei nova se with lower ram and more expensive price tag yes just with different model name
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,china phone no good stay away spy spy spy steal your data hahahaha what about fb google cisco fbi etc if dont want get spied should move into jungle
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,its pretty decent device but no gms is big nope for me even if you manually install them there is no way the device can pass safetynet checks and therefore take full advantage of the gms
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,everyone steals the data only way to stop it is to destroy google facebook apple ofc more the difference is how you and many others portray it when there is chance that huawei does it of which there is no single proof its evil and when google and apple do it proven time and again its simply business as usual
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,howcome you would know if google and apple were stealing and selling your data for years everyone steals the data only way to stop it is to destroy google facebook apple ofc every govt on this planet yeah why not just use nukes to do it eh
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,perhaps but its the galaxy only updated hardware with qualcomm snapdragon available
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,samsung galaxy ultra suitable wifi gbitss and wifi se ax perhaps but its the galaxy
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,welcome you dont get sarcasm as well

Huawei,P40 lite 5G,in huawei apps gallery there is no pubg its so anoying try apkpure website
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,huawei germany says it has oled screen comes with type headphones dont think huawei has ever used an oled screen for sub phone european prices it seems that boe their main supplier havent managed to produce good oled displays at competitive price so theyre sticking with flagship and high midrange only
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,huawei lite not good first sim limited only and speeds gbits very low secon more why would you want removable battery in what year are we
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,your info is misleading at best are you simply making stuff up whats dual os you missed understanding with very esay harmony android
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,confused me as well contacted cs at huawei its an ltps ips lcd
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,very good phone im impressed
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,huawei its my favorite brand hope they continue nonmore need for google services
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,such good specced phone for cheap price but sadly no google services its an open source software you can get your apps easily
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,why mah what you want chunky rugged dmah phone not here plus mah is more than enough
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,when available in indonesia
Huawei,P40 lite 5G,sounds like huawei is ramping up cheap phones it certainly doesnt impress in every aspect but it certainly offers stuff that is exclusive to flagships
Huawei,P40 lite E,if you downgrade this phone to build that has security patch april or earlier you can install native google mobile services on this phone using googlefier app same goes for huawei yp but you cant use certain features included in emui like dual apps for apps downloaded from playstore because google mobile services will start showing errors and you will need to install gms all over again to remove those error messages
Huawei,P40 lite E,you are opening google apps and your phone doesnt have google play services download your apps using gspace

Huawei,P40 lite E,am seriously considering this phone but cannot see what applications am able to download more without problem can install facebookmessenger viber watsapp and even has google maps the best part is when transfer ur data via phone clone those apps will automaticly be installed and all ur history of conversation will be saved
Huawei,P40 lite E,if its cpu is not connected to google services its mean we cant download google app nd along more honor or dont now has kirin chipset and its support google services also honor and has google services preinstalled sorry for my bad english
Huawei,P40 lite E,that is correct the cpu is not connected to google services kirin has great peformances more if its cpu is not connected to google services its mean we cant download google app nd along with this will also unable to browse through google plz make it clear
Huawei,P40 lite E,nice specs for lowmid range phone and its affordable great battery mah it has enough memory space triple camera you just cant wish for more in this price range
Huawei,P40 lite E,reasons not to buy huawei lite microusb is better in every single way
Huawei,P40 lite E,it seems like great device especially for that price big screen big battery decent memor more coudlnt agree more with nice battery and big screen best phone in its price range
Huawei,P40 lite E,great new device made by huawei it delivers truly stunning performance for an extremely affordable price it has great camera and high capacity battery
Huawei,P40 lite E,theyre two completely different phones lite was rebranded in some countrys and it goes by series dont know why they do this but it is like that in my countrycroatia it goes by lite and in some asian countrys it goes by series
Huawei,P40 lite E,lite is branded in some countrys as prime theyre two completely different phones
Huawei,P40 lite E,you said this phone is above series when it isnt the prime exists lite is branded in some countrys as prime
Huawei,P40 lite E,so what is ur opinion then why no its cheap its has good specs hope are not one of thos more and no it doesnt have good specs
Huawei,P40 lite E,it wont because huawei officially stated they are never going back to google services so th more that is correct the cpu is not connected to google services kirin has great peformances for mid range models and that is why is still used on new phones this phone has no preinstalled google services but as you already heard there are many options how to download or transfer apps to your phone by phone clone or using huawei appgallery or moreapps
Huawei,P40 lite E,it does and that content is hahahaha no so what is ur opinion then why no its cheap its has good specs hope are not one of those guys who would buy iphone or ultra for your kids while they cant even hold the phone the right way
Huawei,P40 lite E,reply needs to have actual content it does and that content is hahahaha no
Huawei,P40 lite E,it seems great phone for lowmid range phonesi would reccomend buying this phone for kids more hahahaha no
Huawei,P40 lite E,since they cant install android on new phone models they just keep renaming the old models he more huawei is still using android and they are keeping it google services on the other hand are not preinstaled on the phone still as said in the post before there still are huawei appgallery and moreapps to download mostly everything
Huawei,P40 lite E,without google services huawei is dead on the spot outside china try samsung for high end more not true at all you have both appgallery and moreapps to download everything you might need not to mention that you can transfer mostly everything through phone clone
Huawei,P40 lite E,clone of the huawei yp actually the lite was rebranded in certain countries
Huawei,P40 lite E,honor pro has better speciation than huawei samsung launches monster has more more brother the simply ends up costing sm where between to where am this is no competition
Huawei,P40 lite E,emui features is not sumsung copy notification panal is not good deasain
Huawei,P40 lite E,still android need android
Huawei,P40 lite E,this phone may come with google since its chip rather than the if the model number more it wont because huawei officially stated they are never going back to google services so the chipset doesnt matter here
Huawei,P40 lite E,wtf are you two talking about of course they can install android the limitation is only on more this phone may come with google since its chip rather than the if the model number match older huawei device then we can assume it has google
Huawei,P40 lite E,mean that is smart move tho no since us cant say hey you cant use android google on old ph more wtf are you two talking about of course they can install android the limitation is only on google services and huawei decided to never implement those anyway so no google is not to blame for huaweis insane moves
Huawei,P40 lite E,that aint no potherwise is downgrade why would it have gig storageitz android more idk it say lite but hey you do you
Huawei,P40 lite E,huawei mate lite might use fast charging think so alan
Huawei,P40 lite E,admit that huawei lite dont use fast battery charging or maybe costs more huawei mate lite might use fast charging
Huawei,P40 lite E,here at philppines that is huawei yp it cost pesos
Huawei,P40 lite E,lite way better than lite this is the lite check the specs for the lite
Huawei,P40 lite E,lite is way better in terms of space infact is mini version of lite
Huawei,P40 lite E,didnt google already enforced that every new android phone must come certified launched more here we go again with the fanboys with samsung you dont have to worry about this aspects what do you expect for that price with the things that you say feels like its easy to you to give what they want without thinking what you have lol always craving for more and did not get contented
Huawei,P40 lite E,so many useless variants huawei is releasing in their lowermidend range and includes the honor lineup
Huawei,P40 lite E,why are they showing us the yp we wanted lite
Huawei,P40 lite E,dont even know
Huawei,P40 lite E,why only gb watt charger the lite has better specs in this department this is lite lite version of ps lite version its lite
Huawei,P40 lite E,why have the gone backwards for the lite plastic back and display was looking forward to this phone
Huawei,P40 lite E,huawei yp huaeei lite honor play none fingerprint
Huawei,P40 lite E,none of lite lite will come with kirin so lite will come with kirin
Huawei,P40 lite E,why why this device if the lite was ok
Huawei,P40 lite,it is good like the first month or few weeks of use then it gets slower than literal itel
Huawei,P40 lite,since it was old it was trash at bettery and overheats very well bjt it wohld have up siedessorry for typo but yeah its really good for gaming and camera
Huawei,P40 lite,had it second hand but it still performed very well for me the battery and for games without problems unfortunately since it did not have protection the screen broke
Huawei,P40 lite,its doing its job no battery problems no screen problems but no updates on apps is just more you can use apkpure good for everything helps and appstorei forgot the real name uses apkpure to download apps hope it helps
Huawei,P40 lite,years white mine battery stil ok still fast on browsers and social mdia apps about google apps just get gbox app very good cheeap phone
Huawei,P40 lite,still strong very fluid no lags whatsoever battery still the original even the frame rate looks more than im considering antivirus subscription and make it my main phone since doesnt have security updates anymore since android base is from linux should be enough

Huawei,P40 lite,hi to all want to switch from this phone to motorola edge neo how can transfer my data without google play services moving to lite was very easy with the built in phone clone app but the other way
Huawei,P40 lite,it was my first mid range phone good screen good performance good charging time the cameras are average but dont use them often had to change the phone for another one with google services but im reluctant to sell it looking to the specs its not big deal the thing is doesnt have the google services that puts heavy load on the system doesnt have almost any apps running in the background its like you are buying rooted phone from factory with all the tweaks done new budget phones may come with hz displays but they lag everywhere if you are ok with hz display and need it for browsing and doing your social apps recommend it
Huawei,P40 lite,does anyone else lite have widevine now im running on emui
Huawei,P40 lite,have this phone years its working like the first day missing kirin processor

Huawei,P40 lite,has anyone experienced slow keyboard response on latest emui update tried different keyb more hi nsy you are not alone since updated to emui gboard or swiftkey or any other keyboard try is just lagging slowing your conversation down and very uncomfortable annoying if there is solution which worked for you id like to try it too am even thinking of migrating from huawei to other brands rev patrick mndebele

Huawei,P40 lite,honest review performance wise its awesomerear camera is awesome but the front camera sucks the pics from the front camm are blurry ive never been this disapointed the rear cam takes excellent night pics though maybe the nova series can do better with the cameras
Huawei,P40 lite,you can see how all these manufacturers downgrade the build over time lite glass back more lite plastic back no frame lite no back no frame
Huawei,P40 lite,my fingerprint is not working it just left the phone any solution
Huawei,P40 lite,my phone have issue with the calibrator how do get it fixed

Huawei,P40 lite,anyone received emui yes lol receive emui
Huawei,P40 lite,thats one of the huawei phone dont want to see this phone have got same problem once the system crashes it will never work again thrown away lite with same problems
Huawei,P40 lite,mb of back ground data in hours this machine is cooking people
Huawei,P40 lite,unable to use google maps on this phone even cannot share my location through whatsapp more try downloading it from aurora store im using google maps for months now no problems at all
Huawei,P40 lite,compared to phones with google this phone is shifter much lighter and faster and the camera is not bad either
Huawei,P40 lite,eish my lite doesnt want me login on my capitec new app pls assist me have been more download the capitec app from aurora reinstall it and try again
Huawei,P40 lite,useless phone ever from one fall the lcd is shuttered better my guess am gonna down grade from this these new phones are useless no radio like really
Huawei,P40 lite,have my lite for around weeks now and while im satisfied with the device more well you cant stop massive input via software haha
Huawei,P40 lite,huawei lite dont have radio fm integrated
Huawei,P40 lite,certain touch sample rate testing apps require you to calculate the sample rate by substractin more thats like the same thing you when you say that mouse polling rate is calculated when you use the mouse tester app than substract it with refresh rate of the monitor touchpaint apk by kdragn he is one of the best xda developers is accurate always it generates its input directly from displays framebuffer so there is no assumption with it you can check its source code if youre interested as my posts wont get approved if share links its true that other things also affect touch latency like cpu usage ram usage touch input prioritization distance between touchscreen panel oleds are usually thinner than ips panels etc but compared the equivalent of lite in terms of display redmi note both have around the same input lag feel too it both have hz refresh rate hz touch sampling rate maybe some users got bad batches of lites panel or even different displays so they are having these issues fe poco xpro have tianma or huaxing display huaxing is better most users encountered ghost touching issues with tianma panels cheers
Huawei,P40 lite,by that logic my poco would have hz touch sampling rate instead of hz if follow yo more certain touch sample rate testing apps require you to calculate the sample rate by substracting the refresh rate this is common knowledge and there are articles and youtube videos on this the lite and lite are in no way comparable to the redmi note moto plus and certain realme devices within the similar price range that also have hz displays when it comes to touch sampling ratelatency lag if you use generic app it will display the touch response based on the refresh rate which is generic estimation ie this isnt however true reflection as other factors such as touch latency need to be considered other apps that actually measure your touchresponse and display the rate would therefore require calculations to determine the devices accurate sample rate the lite and lite have sluggish touch sample rateresponse rate and latency issue its evident if you actually own and use the handset for period of few weeks and compare it to other devices within the same spec bracket
Huawei,P40 lite,if it needed substracting developer would include it to be done automatically it also report more the lite does not have hz touch sampling rate please stop spreading misinformation download any other app such as the touch multi test app to verify this ive tested it on numerous occasions and if could upload screenshots would to show you that it alters between calculated touch sampling rate of hz after deducting the screen refresh rate of hz you can tell just by using the handset its sluggish and slow to respond especially when compared to an pro
Huawei,P40 lite,what no it shows the correct touch sampling rate no substracting at all if it needed substracting developer would include it to be done automatically it also reports correct hz touch sampling rate for my poco nfc
Huawei,P40 lite,to calculate the touch sampling rate youre supposed to subtract the screen refresh rate more what no it shows the correct touch sampling rate no substracting at all
Huawei,P40 lite,absolutely not true my friend just tested it with kdragns touchpaint apk touch more to calculate the touch sampling rate youre supposed to subtract the screen refresh rate hz from the figure presented in the app
Huawei,P40 lite,camera like it front camera is so good and the back camera is pretty good same battery performance this is the only thing that am not that satisfied with cant say that this mah battery is bad but it is not as expected design like it screen good colour good contrast and good brightness adjustment youll like it too processor very fluid smooth and not lag in everyday use in social media and etc charger very fast charging minute charging fingerprint very fast huawei mobile services havent issued any problem with nogoogle yet everything that installed worked as normal as on other phones with gmsapkpure and thats it rating only for the battery cant say that is wow but it does its job idk recommend this phone like it

Huawei,P40 lite,for those using ictfix is it permanent solution to google services is it possible to update apps when services start working im thinking of getting the phone if that works
Huawei,P40 lite,my advice next time buy an expensive phone that does not dare to crack when it falls if you open specs before you bought youll see that it doesnt have any protection simple its plastic no gorilla glas no aluminum thats was only thing that was pushing me away but bought it and for some change bought good protection and everything is good and do know when touch it doesnt feel cheap astic its nice sturdy but not great thats why protection
Huawei,P40 lite,mean its not exactly huaweis fault its all coz huawei are far ahead with gand why they are to be the one with all that information that can use with in one way monopoly on gno america wont allow it they want to be the one to spy on us from front row but it doesnt matter coz chinese will still have front row seat its all just about money and privilege now everyone is going to wait years so america can catch up with huawei and then will be availableim using in eu huawei im using all google apps and everything with no problem minutes work for an average person its all thats needed to be able to get use google apps and believe me the phones are amazing tested against simular phones from biggest brands and have almost double the performance for eltelss money
Huawei,P40 lite,hun harmonyos is ripped off android with no google services that huawei is more mean its not exactly huaweis fault
Huawei,P40 lite,lite no harmony os in future no get shame huawei hun harmonyos is ripped off android with no google services that huawei is trying to present as new ecosystem its giant scam but trust me people will attack you for speaking the truth

Huawei,P40 lite,read peoples reviews about huawei lite and as matter of fact liked everything said about the phone except the fact that it doesnt have google play store thats pretty bad for such an awesome phone not to have google play store however went ahead and bought the phone because believe google play store would be installed in the phone via firmware update in the indefinite time yet to come bought the phone because im addicted to heawei
Huawei,P40 lite,will it get emu
Huawei,P40 lite,my problem with this handset sluggish screen touch response rate slow wifi speeds no more simple low the brightness tf
Huawei,P40 lite,legit the malig mp is so good just look at the mhz speed thought of buying the phone but my decision was already made this phone can do heavy gaming
Huawei,P40 lite,this phone model is what have is good one im pleased by it
Huawei,P40 lite,this phone cant even handle getting droped from stairs was walking down and slipp more my advice next time buy an expensive phone that does not dare to crack when it falls
Huawei,P40 lite,great phone got it for the camera is really good not flagship levelbut definitely upp more many apps are grouped under lifestyle select messenger pro many apps like whatsapp facebook etc are there
Huawei,P40 lite,stay away at all costs also thought well who needs google services id be better of more apkpure will solve your problems
Huawei,P40 lite,hi really need assistance on how to download certain google applications that need to use go to pital search and download there apps
Huawei,P40 lite,no gyroscope bubg donot work
Huawei,P40 lite,it means that the phone does not come with google services installed for example google play more google maps working well like google translate the alternative to youtube is youtube vanced which is realistically much better than youtube
Huawei,P40 lite,installing the google play services on any huawei device will take about minutes of your more hello how is the general performance of phone after installation
Huawei,P40 lite,this phone huawei lite havent let me down love it because of the bigger screen more hi really need assistance on how to download certain google applications that need to use
Huawei,P40 lite,im interested in getting this phone but there are few things that concern me first of more gms sideload and whatnot are not really setandforget you gotta do it again and again after updates etc and many apps depend on it not just google ones as far as performance kirin is like snapdragon so pretty capable
Huawei,P40 lite,which one should buy huawei or lite do not care about google services the main more is the best phone have ever used personally think that series kicked it out too soon series should have remained available for much longer period of time however google if youre looking for great camera you dont need to look any further the quality of photos is equal to those taken by pro and at price of around eur for used but undamaged phones id rather buy second hand than new to be honest
Huawei,P40 lite,look the phone is greatcamera is very goodthe screen is decentthe chipset is really capable and theres plenty of memorysureit doesnt have googlebut its not their fault theyre going the extra mile to bridge the gapobviously some apps are missingbut lot of them are on apk pure and they run on the phonethe alternatives are good tooand the basics are therei personally like the fact they can carry onwith all those things going against them right now
Huawei,P40 lite,dont google as problem from the phone just have to figure out how to get those goog more lol just lol your life must be sad you like it cos its challenge to install apps aint no body got time for that what waste of time
Huawei,P40 lite,as we speak got google play and gmail on my lite which side loaded they are working more oh wow wish we were all as cool as you the phone sucks end of story
Huawei,P40 lite,was using some models from huawei up to mate pro the processor became week went to more nonsense
Huawei,P40 lite,own this phone it is extremely good for gaming for its price installing gms on this is extremely easy all you need is just to downgrade your emui version from to install googlefier and then you have gms
Huawei,P40 lite,inches sized phone is nonsense plus the weight and its brick have inch ta more you are one of the few who complains about the huge screen at this time everyone loves the bigger have been using the screen for years now and would like an even bigger one as they say bigger better pleasure
Huawei,P40 lite,hey everyone if you wanna buy this phone go for it its wonderful device crafte more just what wanted to hear thanks
Huawei,P40 lite,for the cant you download google and play store and so forth or just clone the app more no bummer im sending my lite back just got it today had no idea that couldnt get google on it what crock my old was crushed under the car so there is now no way to get my contacts and apps ported across as id used google drive to back up total blow out fix this problem huawei
Huawei,P40 lite,its absolutely killing me that nothing works on google it may have good camera but more use apk pure instead
Huawei,P40 lite,do yourself favour and do not get huawei with the huawei app gallery huawei more ive been useing the lite with app gallery and its been fine this means are tooo clinched on to google services then
Huawei,P40 lite,ive used both the kirin and the sd in my opinion the kirin is way more refined and efficient im not sure if it is to do with optimization but ive used handsets specifically oppo and realme and oneplus and they stutter and lag sometimes and arent very refined the kirin in my litei has yet to experience any issues and prefer using it every thing is so smooth and stable
Huawei,P40 lite,hey guysi was thinking on lite smart or which one should buy thanks do yourself favour and do not get huawei with the huawei app gallery huawei lite is useless frustrating phone to use an absolute waste of money
Huawei,P40 lite,please what is mens no google services it means that the phone does not come with google services installed for example google play google maps etc

Huawei,P40 lite,which phone should buy plite or plite need an advice plus can use gmail on plite yes definitely you can add your gmail email accounts as imap normally no problem the problem is with installing and running some google tools like youtube google keep as an application if you install them they dont work but easily you can use them in browser
Huawei,P40 lite,bought gb version few days go and am very pleased it is very fast with excellent battery the unavailability of google service is not big deal even for me as computer engineer used huawei store and almost could find anything want for exceptions like whatsup could find installable file everywhere on internet and manually install it dont live in iran but as far as know googleplay already is not available in iran and they have invented counter part of it cafebazaarir you can use it too like googleplay it also provide you updating when new version is available for some services like google map there are many better options like yandex map found it good opportunity to try disconnect my dependency to google even replaced google keep noting tool with huawei notes google contacts with huawei contacts very good anyway future belongs to those chinese and it is time to get ready

Huawei,P40 lite,hello everyone have one question for buying new phone huawei lite redmi redm more have huawei honor and xiaomi redmi note and can tell you that the huawei honor is much better without problems while xiaomi has frequent problems with wifi connection and messages that are delayed by hours advise you from my experience that the huawei is much better and safer
Huawei,P40 lite,is samsung as better than huawei lite dont know wich to buy wich one would you choose incomparable samsung is classes below you can compare with samsung
Huawei,P40 lite,hello need help want to ask that which phone is better between the sumsung and the hua more its hard to compare my friend huawei plite beats the in every aspect
Huawei,P40 lite,my brother just upgraded from xiaomi redmi note ai to this device heres what noticed so far battery life is excellent although he is not huge user with the location turned on all the time step counter etc he easily gets sot think sot is reachable camera awesome great details color grading is very good although sometimes bit over top compared to my xiaomi mi which has the same main camera think lite excels it ultrawide is less detailed on lite but the colors are better although it doesnt have telephoto lens zoom is doing great job and often better than the dedicated lens on mi gsmarena in review already explained the science about it performance awesome phone costs new as much as my mi used yet the cpu is faster build quality it clearly feels not very premium and we can recognize the costs have been cut here but the phone usually goes into case and then it doesnt matter would accept this cost ut for better soc or camera software feels like miui premium version polished stable for week small configuration updates showed up which should be good sign no problems with installing apps everything so far is available and not difficult to install display this is my only complaint about this phone ive got used to samoled on mi but even when compare it to old redmi note ai this display looks hideous the colors are bad bland they dont represent the colors truthfully the display feels laggy and can notice ghosting trails and slow refresh rate dont know if huawei used different suppliers cause the display doesnt come close to the words from the review but this is my biggest disappointment ab this phone btw my brother got the silver version it seems to be very rare but it looks much better than green or black one
Huawei,P40 lite,hi friends need your help have new huawei lite my question is how must charge the more to prolong the life of your battery pack keep these tips in mind for proper lithiumion or lipo battery care the lifespan of your battery should last between charge and discharge cyclesdepending on the manufacturer which usually amounts to yearsin short if want my battery to last longer should not charge it above max and not let it discharge below battery level because discharge cycles they destroy the battery at this range you receive the best balance of depth of discharge and runtime if you stay in this zone you can maximize your battery use and retain that healthy battery life for much longer timeliion and lipo batteries are designed to perform its best between percent and percent capacity so once the battery hits lower than feel free to charge your smartphone already likewise once the charge hits percent you really dont need to wait for your phone to reach percent anymore you can check this in battery power consumption details battery usage and you will see how this cycle does not count here so it will not ruin the cycles or more precisely if you stay in this zone then you will see that in battery power consuption details used and here you see that it is on battery days or more and that means it does not count the cycles but if you discharge below and charge above then it takes away your cycle and starts from the beginning or counts in minutes and hours so think of you battery as the human body throughout the day you dont really need to wait like youre about to die to take some rest and recharge yourself and you also dont need perfect eight or nine hour sleep to be able to function at full capacity this method has been tested and works perfectly your battery will last very very long time and you will never change it
Huawei,P40 lite,depend on how much battery it came from the box dont charge your phone straight away if more thank you very much for your answer
Huawei,P40 lite,is the battery of the phone good its legendary
Huawei,P40 lite,hi guys do you know lite will get harmony os next year this step will change every th more only with emui phones be supported harmony os maybe next year they update this emui version
Huawei,P40 lite,is the lite too big for one hand use honestly no have pretty small hands and it fist comfortable at first it was little tricky but after like week didnt even notice its size
Huawei,P40 lite,im little indecisive lite or nova because based on what ive read on huaweis website both devices are getting the new emui which one is likely to last between both of them
Huawei,P40 lite,got mine on sale case and it was tremendous value followed guide on youtube by system hacks and got gms working to do not need gms for much only to get banking app and games working
Huawei,P40 lite,is euros expensive no euro
Huawei,P40 lite,hi guys samsung or lite im stuck between the two lite has much better overall performances so that is better option
Huawei,P40 lite,go with its more uptodate and the camera processor and overall performance is ju more is euros expensive
Huawei,P40 lite,if google is needed if battery and performance is needed even thought this phone doesn come with google servicesyou can still download google chrome playstore and etc just watch or youtube vidsw
Huawei,P40 lite,the is flagship phone while the lite is mid range phone definitely go with go with its more uptodate and the camera processor and overall performance is just better
Huawei,P40 lite,hi friends want to buy lite but am confused about question about youtube my li more get youtube vanced it also has free yt premium features and is completely free and safe to use
Huawei,P40 lite,many apps are not available must register in app gallery and select your contry first think like you but all apps is there without register you cant see all provided apps
Huawei,P40 lite,phone just working better without google services google services take too much ram memory and battery on my samsung just removed google services it working better then samsung note we can have normal life without google
Huawei,P40 lite,gotta admit was sceptical at first getting this phone at first always been fan of huawei but thought can live without google services and boy was wrong this phone is just amazing fast and snappy plus the camera quality is just wow fear not about google services there are work arounds like bluemail for gmail which is basically the only app that was concerned about would definitely recommend this device any day loving it
Huawei,P40 lite,curse the day bought my lite dnt love it at all for the first time in my life hating my own phone it is baddd and most used apps are not supported nor available is like bought this phone for calls and whatsapp only hate it hate it hate it pity can not do anything abought it bought it bought it pissedd
Huawei,P40 lite,redmi note vs huawei lite which is better want to buy phone for me but am confused dont know which one to buy between this two
Huawei,P40 lite,which is better huawei lite or huawei nova
Huawei,P40 lite,lite all aplication work many apps are not available
Huawei,P40 lite,lite or redmi note proplease
Huawei,P40 lite,dont recommend this at all there are multiple apps that ca not be accessed because not supported by google playstore this phone doesnt support goodle playstore at all understand if they are trying to promote their own playstore but it just so hard to use yes they have apkcure to download other apps in google but once you installed it it wont function still without google so like many banking app in uae can not function on this phone so frustrating not user friendly unless otherwise are the kind of person who only wants camera fb or instagram other wellknown social platform are okay but not all
Huawei,P40 lite,lite or dont care for google the quality of the photos is what matters the is flagship phone while the lite is mid range phone definitely go with
Huawei,P40 lite,hows the camera is it better than devices like samsung or im thinking of more the camera is way better than or an but wouldnt recommend this phone because of the lack of gms if you know what you are doing and have some experience you can use it perfectly without gms but if person is accustomed to phone with gms please dont buy them this phone the lack of gms also affects notifications you wont receive most and app compatibility this can be sort of fixed if you have the right knowledge if your parents regularly use any google service dont buy this if they arent attached to any google service and assuming you can install stuff like microg before giving them the phone to fix notifications this is awesome phone for the price
Huawei,P40 lite,hello pals want to get this phone but want to know if it has notification led it doesnt have notification led
Huawei,P40 lite,the lite is called nova in some regions so its exactly the same phone the camera is way better than or an but wouldnt recommend this phone because of the lack of gms if you know what you are doing and have some experience you can use it perfectly without gms but if person is accustomed to phone with gms please dont buy them this phone the lack of gms also affects notifications you wont receive most and app compatibility this can be sort of fixed if you have the right knowledge
Huawei,P40 lite,what phone is better plite or samsung galaxy would say that is little bit better but have to consider that it costs like euros more than lite im using lite and didnt have any problems while using apps everything is working fine if want to save good amount of money and have good phone then lite is better overall
Huawei,P40 lite,which one is better redmi note pro or lite is the better phone if yo do not need gms or google services that is the big question really
Huawei,P40 lite,hi all so after having the huawei lite for weeks this is my opinion what an awesome phone come from the lite which ive had for over year and is now passed on to my motherinlaw who cannot believe that such tech exist lol anyway my biggest wow factor is the battery life on the lite use my phone by the minute whatsapp mostly and have disabled the turnoff screen feature after few minutes so now it just stays on until lock the phone even so go through day without charge as for google play services do not miss it at all all my apps are sorted through appgallery and findorra vanced youtube with vanced microg is such breeze no subscription and yet can listen to music while my phone is locked no ads all the premium benefits the only downside is mtn sa has locked the nd sim slot so can only use sim in the phone where as telkom and cellc has dual sim capabilities wish can have dual sim just for the incase matters nevertheless im always in wifi zones so its not really biggy conclusion if youre two minded about google play services etc like was can now put you at ease and confidently say you will not be making mistake going with this beast of phone oh and did mention camera oh my goodness
Huawei,P40 lite,my review since having this phone for over months have fallen deeply in love with this phone have both the standard lite and the lite which have now given to my girlfriend there is something so nice about having plastic backed light phone again it feels so comfortable and durable in the hand it doesnt feel fragile like those flimsy glass and metal phones was hesitant about going google free but decided to take the jump and absolutely love it it feels so liberating being able to get rid of the battery draining hog of play services youtube vanced is an amazing youtube app alternative havent missed google at all and in fact love the alternative app stores ive discovered such as aptoide and aurora dont think ever want to go back to google services phone again now the lites main advantage over the lite varient is the screen the varient has such low contrast dull display the standard lite has such great lcd screen its very accurate and watching videos and viewing pictures is really joy at the cheap price point im glad its also lcd as dislike oleds etc due to pulse width modulation and screen burn ins the cheapset is great for everyday tasks however do notice lags in some apps such as the walli wallpaper app when scrolling this lag does not appear on the varient there are some other lags here and there in other apps but they are miniscule battery life is great however and the fast charge is great dont get battery anxiety anymore the biggest letdown for me is in the camera recording department there is no ois or eis in any of the camera recording modes this is such letdown here is where the version shines as that includes eis also received an software update and now it seems huawei are copying google regarding play services huawei have their own huawei mobile services and have imposed some battery hogging too like the voice assistant app its always running and there is no way to fully disable it in the battery usage section its mainly the voice assistant and huawei mobile services that are using the most battery power not sure why huawei did this as before the update these battery hogging services were not present overall however the ui the ease of use the grip and feel makes the standard lite real great joy to use it just works everything flows the soundvolume level is great the bluetooth is fast the touchscreen is very accurate when typing etc preferred it to the version which ended up gifting to my girlfriend didnt notice any gaming performance difference between the chipset and the wish manufacturers would make more light plastic phones and include more powerful processors the is now year old it holds its own against the sdg but the sdg is clearly more powerful as are the new dimensity series chips im hoping the lite will past me whole year of good performance really feel like found bargain at the price paid
Huawei,P40 lite,recommended lite you can live without services go for honor view lite display is not really good too much contrast eye straining also some apps wont work without gms libraries like ebay
Huawei,P40 lite,display is not good ive been using lite lite honor play honor view there is too much contrast on lite display need to use eye comfort mode constantly in order to use it dont recommend it it cannot be fixed by color management go for honor view it costs more but you get superb ips display oled displays strain my eyes kirin google services

Huawei,P40 lite,it seems gms has detrimental effect on the battery huawei is known to have aggressive batte more thanx for that am currently stuck with what want was looking at the and also the lite but for the price difference it is better to get the lite my only concern was the play store and how it will affect me basically use whatsapp lot and have gmail you seem to have answered my question on both am technophobe so hopefully should go this route hope can find my way around it

Huawei,P40 lite,this phone on paper looks amazing uwu it is also excelent while using it camera is great and battery life of mah with charging just did it for me personaly its recommendation for middle range priced phone
Huawei,P40 lite,why not just buy the nova seems like completely the same specs but with much better build more why would you buy glass phone in this price range and risk having expensive repairs plastic is the way to go
Huawei,P40 lite,yeah oled screens are beautiful although for gaming qled is the way as hear too bad they more yup yup and this phone has ltps ips lcd oo ips is good for gaming and is cheaperbut the other specs are not meant for gaming that much not sure what is the target audience for this phone its cheap but the components seem to be like randomly picked
Huawei,P40 lite,im not wrong so wont admit anything like said we can do this all year long but cant more fine then you choose to wait until my reply is approved
Huawei,P40 lite,nope have facts and you have your opinion its as simple as that now you are to wait until more im not wrong so wont admit anything like said we can do this all year long but cant see how that makes you happy
Huawei,P40 lite,for example on pc its rare for me to watch videos in full screen bcoz sit quite close to more yeah oled screens are beautiful although for gaming qled is the way as hear too bad theyre both expensive so my next tv will probably have led screen my current tv is an old plasma so switching to led will still be step up
Huawei,P40 lite,hahaha youre mocking me for something thats not even my fault have no idea why apostroph more nope have facts and you have your opinion its as simple as that now you are to wait until the reply is approved or admit youre wrong
Huawei,P40 lite,deleted post hahaha youre mocking me for something thats not even my fault have no idea why apostrophes dashes etc in that comment are looking weird andor missing not that its important if thats all you can come up with then think we should just stop talking to each other otherwise we could do this all year long and theres no point in that have my opinion and you have yours end of story
Huawei,P40 lite,youre right is replaced by and that will be replaced by eventually my point is more ugh my reply is going to be delayed until its approved by moderator that is if it is approved
Huawei,P40 lite,its the pixel size that determines what is better almost all of the phones these days has more youre right is replaced by and that will be replaced by eventually my point is that dont need that high resolution to enjoy movie or whatever watch have tv and yet still download the movies and tv shows watch in xvid format and sometimes in and still enjoy watching them rarely download anything in my phone is also set to record videos in only but some people not you just cant process that not everyone is crazy about watching stuff in
Huawei,P40 lite,no you didnt make yourself clear with that messed up reply it wasnt messed up it was probably just too much for you to understand heres the short version this maybe youll get you care about dont deal with it
Huawei,P40 lite,anything less than looks bad so you say but just because thats your opinion it doesn more no you didnt make yourself clear with that messed up reply
Huawei,P40 lite,anything less than looks bad and theres nothing more to it is the standard from li more anything less than looks bad so you say but just because thats your opinion it doesnt mean its true or that everyone else thinks the same heres the thing about decade ago people were amazed how sharp and beautiful the picture was then years later comes out and suddenly looks bad you see the problem there no still looks nice people just keep falling victim to the marketing machine and want to buy the latest and greatest they even make themselves believe that now looks terrible look im not saying that is bad im saying that not everyone is keen to watch movies or whatever in for some of us is more than enough its like not everyone wants high end phone some people are totally happy with an entry level or midrange phone this may be shock to you but still watch movies in or get this in bdrip format and im totally happy with it if youre into dont let me stop you ok think made myself clear really have nothing to add bye
Huawei,P40 lite,waw this phone its useless for an upgrade lol full hd recording no maybe it will cost bucks
Huawei,P40 lite,dont be ridiculous just because dont care about or higher video recording it doesnt more anything less than looks bad and theres nothing more to it is the standard from literally decade ago
Huawei,P40 lite,ok good be that one guy who looks like he uses the iphone gs to record everything dont be ridiculous just because dont care about or higher video recording it doesnt mean im stuck at iphone gs level for the record always use high end phones show some respect to opinions different from yours and accept that not everyone is excited about recording simple as that
Huawei,P40 lite,couldnt care less about recording so yup im ignoring it ok good be that one guy who looks like he uses the iphone gs to record everything
Huawei,P40 lite,right just ignore the lack of support for shooting in couldnt care less about recording so yup im ignoring it
Huawei,P40 lite,not having eis at this price range is an instant deal breaker let alone the lack of google se more right just ignore the lack of support for shooting in
Huawei,P40 lite,will agree that from everything huawei has released so far this caught my eye the sakura pink looks cool and the design is very clean if only huawei wasnt under the grip of the ccp oh well for those who get this device do enjoy it
Huawei,P40 lite,the phone didnt need it you appeared to make the phone incapable what it needed was proper video stablization
Huawei,P40 lite,why so big nearly mm tall thats too much around would have been perfect
Huawei,P40 lite,which is better this or mate pro kidding do you know whats mate pro
Huawei,P40 lite,phone need the phone didnt need it you appeared to make the phone incapable

Huawei,P40 lite,is the phone water proof noo
Huawei,P40 lite,ask have led indicator for huawei lite need led indicator unfortunately no and it also teases me lot about why all phones nowadays cant put tiny led light that cost almost nothing but offers lot of convenience im sticking to my honor view until phone makers decide to put it back hopefully on their newer models
Huawei,P40 lite,samsung ultra has mp camera means its even worse the camera isnt standalone snapper its just tof thing something to do with affects or blur or some rubbish
Huawei,P40 lite,this light its to light
Huawei,P40 lite,the huawei rep told me he can download all google apps for me if buy huawei phone when more google wants it back on huawei devices so it will be soon
Huawei,P40 lite,does anyone even care about gms anymore most banks is gonna support hms anyhow in europe and more just because you dont like google doesnt mean no one should ill continue using google but that doesnt mean im going to push my opinion on others

Huawei,P40 lite,amol is too expensive midrange samsung devices do have amoled amoled is not that ezpensive but good lcd is way better than cheap oled
Huawei,P40 lite,dedicated macro camera and depth sensor please no just no
Huawei,P40 lite,like the abbreviations and the two characters and stand for the mobile data connection there are similarities and differences between the two names both and designate an lte connection this means that you will only see the abbreviations if you have an ltecompatible device and corresponding contract however lte is not the same as lte depending on the area and mobile operator there are differences in speed with you can theoretically achieve speed of up to mbit the average download speed of this lte connection is mbit the upload speed is mbit and the average response time is ms is little bit faster the abbreviation stands for the latest lte standard the socalled lte advanced here speeds of up to mbit are possible in practice the average download speed is mbit the upload is mbit and the response time is ms

Huawei,P40 Pro,pro easley flagship is always flagship lol
Huawei,P40 Pro,thanks for the info
Huawei,P40 Pro,pro you dont know what you are saying
Huawei,P40 Pro,oh yes its the same thing im facing its so frustrating was also sold more good morning have huawei pro panel for sale

Huawei,P40 Pro,you cant even nearly compare these phones pro is true flagship even now wit more you can compare them
Huawei,P40 Pro,harmony os when for international devices faster huawei more there will be no harmony os for global users huawei ceo said but instead youll still get emui updates
Huawei,P40 Pro,ive used pro pro pro im using ppro for about year now and can sa more exactly why is pro better than pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,is it good jump from mate pro to pro or to another phonerecommend better go for mate pro bro
Huawei,P40 Pro,now that you can download gspace easily with no tech knowledge needed which gets you all your more is it true that you dont receive notifications from apps that are installed from the app gallery and gspace isnt reliable did read that in reddit post
Huawei,P40 Pro,it doesnt look like the ban will be lifted honestly its the unsupported banking more you could just download the online banking app few more clicks granted but for phone worth now available second hand under is bargain
Huawei,P40 Pro,the best device with the best features have seen so fari love it
Huawei,P40 Pro,confused to buy note ultrainr ultrainr note plusinr or more if you are not dependent on google services then huawei is the best
Huawei,P40 Pro,image and video stabilization is amazing good looking phone but without playstore is hassle to use country apps and payment apps or just to check your account its not possible
Huawei,P40 Pro,hi to everyone didnt recieve update of emui and asked the agent my huawei app more check through the my huawei app
Huawei,P40 Pro,recently had this device in hand from ebayi did not like the weight and feel of it slipperyheavyfragilehigh risk devicethe screen has zero scratch resistance but cameras are its selling pointlack of google wasnt an issue for me until realised that most banking apps require google services for security and notificationsthere are hacks to get google partially working but for the price its not worth itneedless to say returned the phone in under minutes
Huawei,P40 Pro,huawei pro or apple iphone which is better if you find this at cheap price get the but if you want smaller form in similar price point get the iphone mini
Huawei,P40 Pro,at least hasten the delivery of your harmony os on his great phone no one is gonna care about google play if your os is on this phone this is great phone and am not letting it go until get hos
Huawei,P40 Pro,people who measure flagship experience on unimportant software updates are the same like peopl more
Huawei,P40 Pro,probably my last huawei last night receive security updates for november and devember and more people who measure flagship experience on unimportant software updates are the same like people who live in luxury but want to act against climate change you got great camera smooth display and good battery life but you cry because you didnt receive software update on time
Huawei,P40 Pro,welcome from lying city the first sentence
Huawei,P40 Pro,we stopped we agreed that we disagree ok
Huawei,P40 Pro,is it android or or just huwiea miui its emui with android only the nova has emui with android
Huawei,P40 Pro,prefer pro over pro for one reson face unlock way better than carppy on screen fingerpeint
Huawei,P40 Pro,gsmarena is not good source of info phones they rarely state updates update antutu scores more is it android or or just huwiea miui
Huawei,P40 Pro,just wanna ask if this is capable for emui and base on gsmarena that update is only more gsmarena is not good source of info phones they rarely state updates update antutu scores and are even biased sometimes the pro already got emui and will get harmony os later this year
Huawei,P40 Pro,keep dreaming under display camera is immature technology also youll be waiting long more well there are few phones that already have it so dont think its unreasonable to think their next flagship will have one but youre probably right it wont have it
Huawei,P40 Pro,this is prob my favourite pseries phone from huawei looks better than the pro on the fr more keep dreaming under display camera is immature technology also youll be waiting long because pro is coming in youll probably wait till like for under display camera
Huawei,P40 Pro,emui android or kinda neither its based of harmony os but harmony os has android code which benchmark apps sometimes detect as android but tbh it doesnt matter because its harmony os at the end if the day
Huawei,P40 Pro,why my pro slow react on lock button turn off display does anybody have same problem ai voice should be disable
Huawei,P40 Pro,true cant judge colors without seeing in person but can tell you that xiaomi was dam more quite wrong its not about pixel
Huawei,P40 Pro,since in every six months have changed my phone because using new phone is my passion am using huawei pro since till today this phone is the best smartphone ever have used in my life just missing some local apps due to android missing all other are best of best
Huawei,P40 Pro,guys stop arguing we like smartphones we like smartphone cameras these are all good smartph more we stopped we agreed that we disagree
Huawei,P40 Pro,httpsphotosappgooglvxgnegromglpvve be my guest this google photos link has pics fr more went through all of them multiple times but since wasnt there can not evaluate colors only texture and detail but it would be unfair for the samsung and huawei since of the pictures from the mi note have been taken on the mp while of huawei and samsung on the mp mod the only time you used samsung and huawei and mp modes were at night were you should never do also its obvious you never used night mode and to be honest suspect you used pro mod the only picture were iso and resolution were similar samsung xiaomi huawei was the leaves were xiaomi and samsung had pretty identical results while huawei had similar result but with better edge detection and more details on the edges
Huawei,P40 Pro,and then you say you are not fanboy you are the only person who says the mi note has more httpsphotosappgooglvxgnegromglpvve be my guest this google photos link has pics from that are only from minote and then series of pictures from minote sultra and ppro from same location on same day differ by maybe up to minutes in order to be able to compare them better you can download the pics if you are not familiar with google photos click on any picture then in the top right corner there is an buttonicon if you click on that you will see location date and cameralens information for some reason the huawei did not store location or it was not on while took the pictures be the judge yourself
Huawei,P40 Pro,if we talk with facts we would talk about the better bigger main sensor on the pro more and then you say you are not fanboy you are the only person who says the mi note has that good camera even the most trusted reviewer in my country who never accepts review units and makes video only if he has something to say said the camera is not perfect and that the pro is about as good camera wise you either dont remember well or you dont want to remember
Huawei,P40 Pro,if we talk with facts we would talk about the better bigger main sensor on the pro and more if we talk with facts we would talk about the better bigger main sensor on the pro and ultra and minote still takes better pics with its mp sensor so how are teh others better yes telephoto is terrible on the xiaomi if compared to ppro but samsung wins without any doubt yes the reason got the other phones was bcoz minote was kinda slow have no doubt about that either if you would read my previous comments you would know that ppro has better response to everything and is extremely fast in unlocking as opposed to sultra which is the slowest in unlocking of the phones never claimed that xiaomi minote is better phone than huawei ppro or sultra just said that it takes best pictures sultra takes the second place and ppro the last place even at night where the ppro should actually be best other phones just take better pictures
Huawei,P40 Pro,sorry for being fanboy of facts if we talk with facts we would talk about the better bigger main sensor on the pro and ultra the far superior ultra wide on the pro and advanced telephoto cameras on the ultrax mp and prox mp ryyb and of course we should not forget the better and more advanced software huawei and samsung has remember we are talking about xiaomi phone the fact you might have tested the three of them on different situations lighting conditions and different software versions doesnt make you an authority by any means because can see the respond hardware does not mean everything have to inform you xiaomi ii not google
Huawei,P40 Pro,why are we even talking to fanboy its like trying to make dog think its cat sorry for being fanboy of facts
Huawei,P40 Pro,as can be seen on the pics took and the cropped version the best what huawei can do and more why are we even talking to fanboy its like trying to make dog think its cat
Huawei,P40 Pro,the haptics are inferior to the samsung and oneplus flagships ive used cheaper phones more hahaha good joke huwei is the best out there and the oneplus is not bad its similar to xiaomi phones which are worse than huawei phones if it comes to screens and optimization of the battery life however have to mention that the minote can run hours straight on google maps navigating and there was no other phone owned to this day that could beat that the and series is worse than huawei ppro in almost any aspect one of the few things that samsung did better is to curve the screen less than huawei did and the has better speaker
Huawei,P40 Pro,dont know why still insist about mpmp debacle its no use on tiny sensor even tex more as can be seen on the pics took and the cropped version the best what huawei can do and the mp ai is slightly better than the photo mode which is some mp and then you see what xiaomi did you can read the whole sign from the mp minote photo but cant from the pproso you tell me the version where you cant read it is better dude are you serious and on the cropped pics of that plate on the wall huawei seems to add artifacts in order to get lucky and gain some details this technique is used in restoring old movies you add grain and then you filter the frames would assume huawei tries to assume shapes thus the fancy thing that happened to that white sign why did crop the pics how else can you tell which pic has more details those pics were hand held and even then did xiaomi won the competition totally destroying the crappy sultra and the ppro just imagine if used the tripod but that would be not fair since then the xiaomi would be far superior and could use the pro mode on it and with pro mode there is no competition to the minote phone said the mp will beat anything that comes out of ppro and you saw the proof was surprised that none of the phones managed to capture the text from the plate on the wall as well that the samsung did not improve with switching to the mp guess its just resizing the mp pic to mp and there is no magic at all well the discussion is over
Huawei,P40 Pro,the pics took were on the very same day usually minutes part and if used tripod tr more dont know why still insist about mpmp debacle its no use on tiny sensor even text on xiaomi samsung worse than huawei and for what you crop the image in high magnification are gonna use the very high cropped image no right mp ai are high res photo with pseudo long exposure stacked imagesof course it takes longer useful in certain scene dynamic range increases if want instant mp dont use ai its taken less than second and again color correction is less processed in mp other shows better because huawei using ryyb huaweis color more accurate in mp annndddd again dont care about high res in smartphone sensor pixelbinned res is the rest of the world prefer it as well it got better overall aspects than high res that only provide bit of details this is getting tiresome already go to basic photography class then come back to me
Huawei,P40 Pro,battery one of the best out there every other phone that have curve display behave the more the haptics are inferior to the samsung and oneplus flagships ive used cheaper phones with far superior haptics like said typing was weak and buzzy and youre right dont own the phone anymore sent it back to huawei for refund
Huawei,P40 Pro,what an overrated phone was willing to overlook the lack of gms if the rest of the phone wa more battery one of the best out there every other phone that have curve display behave the same way auto image processing afterwards that is the cause not the same as viewfinder it becomes better if want it to be synchronize use pro mode haptic is one of the best out there at this point dont even think own the phone
Huawei,P40 Pro,that statement according to you not to professional photographer gsmarena dxo or everyone more the pics took were on the very same day usually minutes part and if used tripod tried to not move the tripod while swapping the phones took all pics myself and can tell how close the pics are to what saw the pics you linked were taken months apartsome of them have leaves on the trees and some dont and like said xiaomi did get some updates here are pics from today with watermark except cant find that option on the sultra pics per phone photo mode ar and also highestbest resolution which means that ppro had pic taken with the mp ai no night mode more info well neither xiaomi nor samsung asked to hold the phone still to sharpen the photo this means both took the pic pretty much instantly in both modesresolutions except huawei in photo mode did exactly the opposite no instant pic can be taken and the mp ai took some seconds to create the pic colorsagain xiaomi did best the other two phones in both resolution xiaomi has probably exactly same colors samsung slightly differs from pic to pic huawei got the colors wrong again can easily tell that both pics have different tint google photos httpsphotosappgooglbvmcraqcycsumxw
Huawei,P40 Pro,ppros pixelbinned quality is worse than mp pic explain that that statement according to you not to professional photographer gsmarena dxo or everyone else no one agrees with you the only better thing in mp are lil bit better in details thats it the rest of aspect such as dynamic range fringing noise control blown highlights artifacts contrast are always better on the pixelbinned size theres nothing wrong having mp over mp given the camera sensor size pro mp httpsfdngsmarenacomimgrootreviewshuaweipprocameragsmarenajpg mi note pro mp httpsfdngsmarenacomimgrootreviewsxiaomiminotehandsondaylightgsmarenajpg pixelbinned low lights pro mp httpsfdngsmarenacomimgrootreviewshuaweipprocameragsmarenajpg httpsfdngsmarenacomimgrootreviewshuaweipprocameragsmarenajpg mi note pro mp httpsfdngsmarenacomimgrootreviewsxiaomiminotecameragsmarenajpg httpsfdngsmarenacomimgrootreviewsxiaomiminotecameragsmarenajpg see the differences even simple basic knowledge in photography can just know pro are overall the better one by mile if dont cant help you and stop spreading false statement around by your words its embarassing
Huawei,P40 Pro,if got anything to do with the blade of the fan like said its got nothing to do about the more ppros pixelbinned quality is worse than mp pic explain that
Huawei,P40 Pro,the blades of the fan reflect lightor if they are transparent then it will have even more if got anything to do with the blade of the fan like said its got nothing to do about the image produced as locked by the auto processing in the camera settings the characteristic between mp mp still different you wrong about week review from it now correcting your statement gsmarena had tones of phones to be compared with rather than you which has bit trust them more than your bizzare comparison method which by your own terms and not the same as everyone else the colors got fixed in night mode are its telephoto its understandable as the sensor is smaller slower aperture the lights are more challenging at night do have problem of understanding the words mp itself already exceeds monitor and still didnt answer my question what will do with that mp produced by small smartphone camera sensor just satisfaction by pixel peeping in monitor decent quality mp must at least have sensor size pixelbinned or bayer sensor res its long way to go for smartphone as ergonomics usefullness design has to be considered dont deny high res even in small sensor produce greater details minimal along with your sample but it also sacrifices dynamic range noise level image stacking contrast color accuracy especially huaweis ryyb demosaicing artifacts etc all you care is about details details details above all when people compared smartphone camera performance they want to know the pixelbinned quality as its the most optimized one even professional agrees with it only use mp in medium format sensor but considering by your photo samples that shows your lack of any compositioning skills looks like you still has limited knowledge in terms of photography sorry has to say it
Huawei,P40 Pro,those led are on the frame not interupted by the fan at all where the fan are in the middle more the blades of the fan reflect lightor if they are transparent then it will have even greater effect on the pictures taken long term review posted on may and the phone was released th april yea earliest pics with date of and oldest yea slightly over weeks of time span true its longer than one week what do know own the phone for about year silly me sarcasm end and you can clearly see in all of the night pics they are either yellowish or greenish tinted too bad the guy who took pics didnt had any other phone to compare to he even said taht some colors got fixed in the night modehe clearly is not blind yes everything bigger than resolution will be digitally downscaled this means it does that pixel binning you are so found of but does not degrade the quality while downscaling loseless downscaling bcoz the output file size doesnt matter try it yourself take high resolution pic and low resolution that is close to resolution of your screen watch them both on your pcnoticed something pic resolution needs to be far greater then the device you are watching it on and like said as the time passes by the standards change soon phones will have mp cameras made by samsung is the current highest standard for tvs and in few months will be for pc monitors so having pics from the past in potato quality will not make me happy at all can see that daylight and nighttime mp pics are better than what ppro can do that is fact and nothing can change that the link to the google photos posted earlier is the proof how can you deny what you see
Huawei,P40 Pro,any led blinks now pay attention that fan of yours has either color leds or few leds in di more those led are on the frame not interupted by the fan at all where the fan are in the middle of course led are blinking but can snap it times the results will be the same where mp produce better color accuracy if youre into photography should know very high resolution on tiny sensor will produce artifacts way worse when the lights is dim thats why pixelbinned resolution are created oem make it as default resolution in all quad bayer sensor phones dont want to explain it again because seems like have no any idea about it httpswwwandroidauthoritycommpcameraphones monitor are at mp are at mp at which are the near res as the monitor mp all you see mp sample on monitor are just downscale from it it cant even handle accurate resolution also why do need mp so can just pixel peep it in monitor what do use it for printed it out on billboard week of time pro long terms review httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweipprolongtermreviewpphp
Huawei,P40 Pro,huawei still creates best quality they arent top anymore because of the ban not because more have no issue with the hardware except from the camera the ppro unlocks extremely well compare to sultra the battery lasts longer too and the swiping on the screen feels precise ans better than on my other phones and the apps work well each time unlike on the sultra its all good and dont care for google servicesuntil start to take pics huawei has lost its edge if it comes to pictures the last phone that was still very good in almost all aspects was matepro since maybe more than months there was no update on the software while the phone is just over year old
Huawei,P40 Pro,it doesnt matter how many it blink results still better also prefer watching the pics at monitors or tvs mp is not good enough mp barely and will be getting myself monitor if they will make any so dont want to take potatoe pics and later ask myself why did even buy phones with mp if dont use them think gsm arena reviews the phones way too positive and after week of use there can be no reliable review
Huawei,P40 Pro,bcoz no one owns both samsung and huawei flagship until you own both of them and maybe more huawei still creates best quality they arent top anymore because of the ban not because of quality
Huawei,P40 Pro,dudeyou seriously compare pictures based on pics of led fans or led screens you know that more it doesnt matter how many it blink results still better accurate in mp mode the same goes even if point it to something else those are gradient of colors an easy sample to show you how much it differs those light arent moving only the fan stop using high res in tiny smartphone quad bayer sensors its not meant to be do see any review on the website compared that way why gsmarena have no issue about it im glad on this thread there are people aware about this
Huawei,P40 Pro,here are the examples httpsdrivegooglecomfolderviewidmerazamdsdzmiwtofrfjgblardf more dudeyou seriously compare pictures based on pics of led fans or led screens you know that any led blinks at least times per second and the ones in your screen can go maybe up to times per second so the camera captures different phases and different colors from the same led putting that aside ppro as seen on the night pics took can barely capture pic with exact same colors more than twice lol and the more pics took the colors became more abstractgreen yellow black and white then blurry
Huawei,P40 Pro,why the heck shot using mp at lowlight go to photo mode or pro mode leave it at more bcoz at lower resolution at night sultra beats the other two phones in some caseswell that album can be altered and can add more picturesyes took tons of pictures in various resolutions with and without tripod not even once could the ppro win the comparison unless its about videos anyway there are tons of pics with some red flowers or whatever that is check the trees in the background those have some small white flowers on them ppro nearly ignored the white flowers but all phones managed to capture the red flowers with nearly same color then pics only by xiaomi without tripod from long before the major updates bad colors and sharpness also artifacts are present but not always be the judge suggest you download the pics bcoz cant compare them otherwise in full resolution then choose best pics and just then check which phone did the pictures your disadvantage is that you have not seen those scenes with your own eyes so you cant tell which colors are correctbut still
Huawei,P40 Pro,the problem with samsung these days is that the updates break more stuff than fix on the su more here are the examples httpsdrivegooglecomfolderviewidmerazamdsdzmiwtofrfjgblardfh notice the big color differences its taken at the same time photo mode mp vs pro mode mp no night mode involves huawei does not need night mode since beating others just in auto wanna know which one more accurate to the real scene based on what my eyes saw the pixel binned mp one ryyb an extra processing are needed to correct its colors that processing doesnt happen in mp increasing lowlight capabilities sacrifice color accuracy but it only happens when theres an artificial lighting going on especially in lowlights the mp ultra wide has no problem because its using rggb same as other brands main camera
Huawei,P40 Pro,have both galaxy and pro months ago bought and before that was using more the problem with samsung these days is that the updates break more stuff than fix on the sultra it took about months until they fixed the problems with main camera the pic quality was ok but nowhere near where its at now and if you believe what samsung users write on the samsung forum page some of the phones have blurry camera on some phones the camera stopped working after an update lol my main issue are the colors can tell that ppro creates fake colors if pics taken at night the colors differ from what can see with my own eyes so much that the pics made by ppro are useless idk if can share here google pics but lets try in that google photos album set of pics for xiaomi samsung and huawei if viewed on pc you click on the in the upper right corner now you can see the full info on the pictures the ones with the church tower got tripod treatment for each phone the others hand held xiaomi was the closest to obtain the original colors as seen with my own eyes httpsphotosappgooglvxgnegromglpvve
Huawei,P40 Pro,you will never go wrong with huawei best phone camera mwah love so much the huawei company gives us the what we want
Huawei,P40 Pro,nope stop telling people around false statements every other person has its appreciations to more bcoz no one owns both samsung and huawei flagship until you own both of them and maybe the xiaomi minote you should stop spreading false information huawei made the best phones and the pic quality was awesome it was now its not if its the pictures quality mp sensor beats the huawei ai maybe if huawei get that sensor they will be at the top again maybe
Huawei,P40 Pro,why large number of applications run at hz for example you tube
Huawei,P40 Pro,hey there got the pro germany managed to replace most of the google services well more if it comes to picture quality sultra and minote beat ppro easily also at taking pics at night
Huawei,P40 Pro,am interested to buy huawei pro in germany in coming days please give me honest advice more hey there got the pro germany managed to replace most of the google services well and besides that the pro is an actual killer phone bit on the heavy side but that doesnt bother me camera quality is unbeatable
Huawei,P40 Pro,you are the first person who complains about pro camera quality know bcoz no one went from huawei to xiaomi and back once huawei and you stay huawei except needed my banking app that could not work without google services that is why went xiaomi and after bought the ppro the pic quality was worse than on my xiaomi phone and it does remain that way and few weeks later broke the screen on the ppro while tying my shoes it literally fell from less than cm and the screen crackedi cant tell how many times dropped my matepro and it only got few scratches yea so with the pro taking worse pics but being an awesome phone anyway needed new phone that could potentially take pics at least as good as the xiaomi minoteso got myself the samsung sultra just to realize it doesnt take that awesome pics got fixed after few updates however the sultra and other series are failure each time get an update that fixed something that didnt work something else stopped working sultra has nice hardware except from the fingerprint sensor but the software is terrible makes the phone to junk that takes awesome pics just as the xiaomi except xiaomi is slower but the software never failed me as much as on the samsung not to mention that unlocking on the minote works like times out of on teh sultra would be happy is it ulocked times out of but it doesnt the ppro unlocks times out of if not there you have it
Huawei,P40 Pro,probably should explain what mean with zoom in mean on the pics while chec more you are the first person who complains about pro camera quality know
Huawei,P40 Pro,would very much want to argue with you and prove you wrong but its am and want to more probably should explain what mean with zoom in mean on the pics while checking them out on pc not the zoom lens who would use zoom at night so yea you can take mp pic with the minote and zoom in on the pic you will get much more details than from ppro and some more than sultra as for the picture quality minote was excellent at day pics from day that was back in there was that prob with huge file size the pics had about mbfile and the delay between taking pics was somewhere close to seconds they fixed it somewhat and in december could take nice pics at night in the pro mode now somewhere close to january it started to take nice pics at night in automatic mode still pro mode beats it and it beats all other phones now back to ppro and why the pics are terrible first of all the pics at day cant compare to twice as big resolution from the sultra and minote secondly the colors are sometimes so far away from what can see with my own eyes that its ridiculous ppro produces pics with fake colors sultra yea it took horrible pics at first think it took like months untill some of the updates fixed that and with each update teh pic quality came closer to what minote did ever since it is sad that phone twice as expensive was that bad today the sultra has some few moments where minote still takes better pics like on the sunrise or twilight but if you take few pics with the sultra then at least will be able to compete with minote and at day almost all will be as good as minote sultra in auto mode with the very small resolution produces the best pics at night of course they are not zoomable but for social media they are perfect while other phones cant get over the bright lights of the cars or street lights at night the sultra in auto mode does this awesomely
Huawei,P40 Pro,ultra and minota take better pics than ppro at day and night its true that more would very much want to argue with you and prove you wrong but its am and want to sleep also their is no point arguing with you while you say the mi note with an mp zoom tele beats the ultra with mp tele its also rediculous to say xiaomi gets better night time photos with smaller rggb sensor the the huawei with the big ryyb sensor and the superior camera software almost every reviewer who compared the mi note with the pro said its not even close at night you and maybe other people believe the ultra was better at photography than the the pro you are either biased hater or you dont remember well just to be clear have tried both the pro and ultra from family members and friends
Huawei,P40 Pro,at least it can take pictures at night and the pro is much better ultra and minota take better pics than ppro at day and night its true that ppro can take pics at night that look as if they were taken at day but only very close range if you take pic of city at night you will throw the ppro against the closes tree at night the sultra takes the best pics of all phones ever owned you can not zoom in as much as on the minote but the contrast and white balance is superior need to mention ppro in its best mode needs at least seconds to take pic regardless if its day or night sultra takes pics always instantly at day and may take sec at night minote will have delay if pics taken with best quality and same as samsung it needs some sec at night of all of those phones minote will make pics with best or same quality as sultra but with the smallest file size for example at day full resolution for all phones same scene ppro mb sultra mb and minote mb twice as many pixels on the minote but not the twice file size compare to ppro
Huawei,P40 Pro,chris aug did anyone manage to find any gcam mod that actually works thanks you dont need it
Huawei,P40 Pro,minote takes better pics than ppro and if you wan tot experience the color shift on the more at least it can take pictures at night and the pro is much better
Huawei,P40 Pro,my previous model was mi note and now im using my buddy huawei pro about two more minote takes better pics than ppro and if you wan tot experience the color shift on the ppro then take some pics at night somewhere in the city where some street lights are on that is where the difference is most extreme
Huawei,P40 Pro,did anyone manage to find any gcam mod that actually works thanks
Huawei,P40 Pro,just be careful plenty of fake pro phones on the market sells on wishcom more nobody will fall for that
Huawei,P40 Pro,so if want to take picture must buy camera if want to search something must buy more an android phone these days has the performance of pc from few years ago yes it is pc
Huawei,P40 Pro,was lost front camera after update pro only selfie work can somebody help me what to do
Huawei,P40 Pro,after update last version was lose front camera not work only selfie camera work can somebody help me
Huawei,P40 Pro,if you need loud stereo sound better buy speaker mobile device is not meant to be speake more so if want to take picture must buy camera if want to search something must buy computer then what sht advice becoming brand fanby really reduce your common sense huh
Huawei,P40 Pro,pro flagship with no stereo speakers waste of momey if you need loud stereo sound better buy speaker mobile device is not meant to be speaker so far am fully satisfied with it dont see any issues so far
Huawei,P40 Pro,is camera worse on emui heard lot of stories that after upgrades camera just get worse nahh wouldnt say it got worse emui actually seems to work in favor of the zoom stabilization but cant claim the main camera got affected by the upgrade
Huawei,P40 Pro,its comparison between cameras of the phones series is just not as good as it sho more about the actual camera those are for my part time works my full time work for weekdays got nothing to do with professional photography as dont bring it are use for daily pics on streets portraits before after work and it does not dissapoint in fact its impressive given its sensor size between my actual cameras of course not better and its telephoto is very useful in my genre of photography
Huawei,P40 Pro,please dont bring actual camera thing in smartphone thread conversation own full frame more its comparison between cameras of the phones series is just not as good as it should be its not about expecting phone camera to beat dslr camera bcoz it cant therefore zoom should never exist on phone and since you own normal camera then you should never have used phone to take photos
Huawei,P40 Pro,you need real camera with huge lenses to take good pics with zoom phones camera can more please dont bring actual camera thing in smartphone thread conversation own full frame apsc camera its night day keep it between smartphone only telephoto in phone can be good use definitely my needs in smartphone camera especially for portraits streets so yes prefer it more than macro skills is the most important thing in photography gear comes second if dont have any skills please dont buy flagship camera smartphone expect good outcome from it
Huawei,P40 Pro,sure cant trust dxomark but everyone should trust random internet guy you can check more guess need to make comparison if do will upload it in form of video on youtube and post link here and this will be mostly pictures comparison
Huawei,P40 Pro,have and it takes fabulous pictures at night dayligh are great but night pics are somet more own sultra that bought after dropped ppro while tying my shoesthat was like less than cm drop and the phone got scored through the case and broke the display on the edge now bought ppro bcoz thought it could take better pics than xiaomi minote that bought it cant videos yes but pictures made by that xiaomi are far better than ppro or almost better than sultra so if someone owns minote there is no better phone to take pictures with own all of those phones and was surprised that it doesnt matter if on tripod or not ppro cant even beat the sultra and xiaomi has set the level way too high and dont get me wrong both sultra and ppro are nice phones and faster than minote but if its picture quality they lost
Huawei,P40 Pro,cant trust dxomark dont know how they compare the pictures but that does not more have and it takes fabulous pictures at night dayligh are great but night pics are something awesome so dont know where do you get that information that ppro takes horrible pictures but obviously you didnt see or touch both phones cheers
Huawei,P40 Pro,just check dxomark if youre interested in cameras especially pro is no in the rank more cant trust dxomark dont know how they compare the pictures but that does not reflect the reality especially so at night ppro takes terrible pics at nightif you compare it to sultra for example
Huawei,P40 Pro,the pro has better camera than the ultra is this correct as im looking at both and cant decide whichim not bothered about google services its easy fix for me
Huawei,P40 Pro,interesting claim compared ppro vs minote vs sultra in both daylight and at night more the pro has better camera than the ultra
Huawei,P40 Pro,have xiaomi pro and it has megapixel camera and tried it by myself with pro an more interesting claim compared ppro vs minote vs sultra in both daylight and at night the results were surprising in daylight pics xiaomi ans sasmung had the most accurate colors and more details than ppro and with xiaomi compared only the mp version bcoz didnt had to use full resolution in case of samsung had to go for full mp bcoz in photo mode it takes some mp pics only at night xiaomi conquered the other both phones without any question but only in pro mode bcoz in photo mode where ai chooses what to do the sultra won the fighthowever the white balance was awesome xiaomi managed to get extreme amount of details so could zoom in now ppro made some pics seem as it was day but none of them had details if the objects were further away and if there was any source of light it would turn it into supernova and make everything around it not visibleand the software added artifacts and sometimes changed the colors of the picture the other phones did not when go to take pics take minote and sultra ppro can only make videos that are maybe better than what sultra does or they have same quality
Huawei,P40 Pro,first of all you said go for pro its the best what huawei phone camera got to off more have xiaomi pro and it has megapixel camera and tried it by myself with pro and the thing found pro captures more detail even in low light and xiaomi isnt good in night mode pro has better picture processing system know theres no google in it but the hardware huawei gaved in pro is comparable to iphone pro max and also ultra tbh guys its not about how many cameras or megapixels you have in the camera its about all over the phone the components and everything am an android and ios user work in mobile shop and know about every phone in the market and test all the phones and just wanna say that if somebody doesnt like the phone please dont try to spread false rumors about them
Huawei,P40 Pro,just use my pro about week and for me the camera is not problem it is working fine and everything is working good well the pro has optical zoom and the pro has optical zoom and it is betteri think but for me the pro is fine and it doesnt cost lot of money like the pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,it is all about your taste furthermore if see scene with your phone can instantly take more said you need real camera with huge lenses to take good pics with zoom good pictures therefore you would have your dslr camera already in your hand or on tripod phones are good for quick pics not for very good pics especially not with zoom
Huawei,P40 Pro,camera has serious problem with focusing in short distance photo color is pour lower class more it is not problem with camera which called serious problem it is simply disadvantage from large camera sensor put it on wide lens or move backward and put it on optical zoom the second method is much better to my taste
Huawei,P40 Pro,even by that comparison pro are better and that comparison are using different emui ver more you need real camera with huge lenses to take good pics with zoom phones camera cant catch enough light for that even with the new more sensitive sensors and you seriously talk about pic taking skills in mobile phone forum you know that regardless of skills if same person makes comparison regardless of what it is then the outcome will be pretty much the same as with the guy who designed that thing the comparison may be on different level and with different details but the result remains same if the good pic quality can only be achieved with tripod in pro mode then its useless taht is why sultra beats pmate series at night and xiaomi beats all mentioned if in pro mode on tripod huawei once made best pictures that time belongs to the past and if pro could take better pics than normal person than that device would be useless for the ppl this phone was made for bcoz this is not professional camera this is phone
Huawei,P40 Pro,just one of the videos out there httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhsparhs and since more even by that comparison pro are better and that comparison are using different emui version after pro got emui image processing are the same as mate plus along with the better specs no one said pro camera are bad here only you did and no one needs zoom bcoz for what by that statement clearly you know nothing about photography really like to see how high your skill in taking photos must be laughable
Huawei,P40 Pro,when someone ask about differences in camera it means the overall aspects not only the main more just one of the videos out there httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhsparhs and since go the ppro which is not that good and has ois on the main camerabcoz not all of us are in love with themselves thus the presence of the selfie camera is obsolete and no one needs zoom bcoz for what so the only thing most ppl will use is the main camera the second one will be for marco
Huawei,P40 Pro,the guy asks which are the better camera between pro and mate there is more when someone ask about differences in camera it means the overall aspects not only the main cam of course the main sensor are the same ive told this numerous times but seems like still dont have any idea about it mate pro main imxy no ois ultra wide angle with lower pixel size less dr slomo beyond fps are all interpolated telephoto with single fl at optical zoom hybrid zoom only laser af pro main imxy ois shutter speed performance better on fast moving object better low light ultra wide angle with bigger pixel size slomo got true fps fps fps are interpolated telephoto with two range of fl optical zoom hybrid zoom and optical zoom hybrid zoom tof better af in low light better dof separation again stop playing smart if dont know what youre talking about
Huawei,P40 Pro,again complicate things up they guy ask which are the better camera between pro and more the guy asks which are the better camera between pro and mate there is no difference in the main camera
Huawei,P40 Pro,did say its different main sensor for whatever it is internationally pro are the more first of all you said go for pro its the best what huawei phone camera got to offer and since only the lite version has different camera then that could be true for all series thus that is not reason to choose pro over the or mate secondly mp beats the mp easily compared mp picture made by xiaomi minote to the mpmp ai by ppro didnt even had to go for the full resolution of the mp to beat the ppro yup if the ai combines data from the pixels and instead of mp does mp the quality will be still superior goes for daylight and night pics too so nly the video quality is most likely best if we talk only about the cameras slo mo video has very brief time limit and at fps the phone will tell you cant record at and ppro can do that too it seems which is totally useless and you can buy matepro its just you will be paying close to eur
Huawei,P40 Pro,ppro ppro mate matepro matepro all of the above have the exact same mai more did say its different main sensor for whatever it is internationally pro are the best smartphone has to offer from huawei variable focal of length mate pro no ois worse uwa omit the fps slomo mate pro are the best theorytically but only available in china so minus that one for sure love to complicate things actually just repeat from the previous answer
Huawei,P40 Pro,having said that think prefer better handling and camera hardware over than other more ppro ppro mate matepro matepro all of the above have the exact same main camera its by sony the imx the difference is in the other cameras mostly the front facing ones
Huawei,P40 Pro,bro are you high pro is of course better then mi note pro oh boy he is high always has been just go look at his ig no one will insert their ig in comment sections but he did am planning to buy huawei really soon
Huawei,P40 Pro,ahh the feature that works with extreme low resolution and requires supernova to light up yo more am huawei user with pro and yes also dislike the smudged colors now and then what tend to do is take raw images or with the master ai switched off such images tend to look natural also when you are taking night mode photos huawei totally nails the colors when you stick it onto tripod as it uses to seconds on the exposure you can be impatient and use auto and get photo that can occasionally look totally wrecked such as the colorful but smudged images at iso xiaomi gets the colors right due to it preferring to adjust the images and take its time however huawei likes to take the photo as fast as possible and many times forgets image colors you can always tinker with the settings to counteract this alsowhat color temperature setting is your huawei phone on as linus tech tips pointed at some asus phones he hated their cameras until he realized that it was the default display color that was messing the photos up colorwise to address the slow motionwell there isnt much to say apart from that its equally terrible across any phone due to the incredibly fast speed the shutter has to take the frames at
Huawei,P40 Pro,again your understanding yea totally useful in daily life unlike getting the right colors in pictures no one needs that right sarcasm intensifies
Huawei,P40 Pro,yea ppro has dedicated software to take pics that are merged together light paintin more again your understanding statements are very funny what the other guy mean are slow motion video where pro can provide fps fps fps still hold the top spot on that regards
Huawei,P40 Pro,try to capture splash of water using your mi note and how about slow motion videos yea ppro has dedicated software to take pics that are merged together light painting and different modes yea only the thing with the sky can not be done with minote as it allows only sec exposure and nothing beyond that but with the water set the exposure time to lets say sec and isowell depending on the light to and you will get your silky water effect yea just the software all phones can do thatthat is why neither sultra nor ppro can use the full resolution that much in pro mode not as much as minote allows that if only that phone could take as good videos as the ppro or sultra it is funny that ppro gets the colors right in videos but cant in photos that is one of the reasons cant use it for pics bcoz then would have to adjust all pics
Huawei,P40 Pro,which is best for super slowmotion videos ang capturing moving objects like splash of water
Huawei,P40 Pro,hmm yea lived for short while in the misconception that the sultra uses the mp to tak more have the mi note and my partner has the simple the photos of the mi note have colors that are extremely faithful to reality much more than the which distorts the colors especially indoors the is better at selfies and takes better photos in low light in automatic mode on the other hand the night mode of the denature the scene once the night mode is activated on the mi note the quality of the photos is excellent in low light so tend to agree with your analysis
Huawei,P40 Pro,the future is the technology of liquid lenses in the camera httpsnewatlascom more not the future at all sound and vibrations have strong effect on liquids such lens would get different density in form of waves caused by the soundvibrations so no go
Huawei,P40 Pro,cons mah battery only for weight of grs no stereo speakers for flagship selfie cam is ugly too long like plus
Huawei,P40 Pro,samsung ultra and mi pro features similar mp sensor but samsung not just but more hmm yea lived for short while in the misconception that the sultra uses the mp to take pics in photo mode but it seems it indeed uses the mp instead if set to which is default and you can even watch jerry tearing down both sultra and mi note and he actually couldnt tell the mp cameras apart pretty much the exactly same senor lenses may be different but who knows yes mp by the vs mp by the mi note vs mpor mp one of those was by the ppro in daylight have not noticed any probs with focusing on any of those phones but at night only mi note could focus on objects or rather light sources that are kilometers away ppro takes okish pics at night if the objects are close range max meters less then pics look like taken in daylight but everything else looks extremely bad what would do is to put the mp into the ppro instead of mp reconfigure the camera app from xiaomi to work on huawei and use speakers from some sony phone perfect phone sultra needs updates if it gets those it will be number one along with mi note if it comes to pic quality at day and night too bad cant put here any samples of the pics need to add the video quality and stabilization on theppro is awesome
Huawei,P40 Pro,mi note and sultra have the exact same mp camera mi note takes better pics than more samsung ultra and mi pro features similar mp sensor but samsung not just but pixel pixel binning accordingly the resulting image is mp largewhile mi pro are combined into single pixel pixel binning the pro features the brandnew mp ryyb sensor with size of inches it is thus much larger than the one on samsungs galaxy ultra and comes with pixel size of the huawei pro had trouble focusing on the object in the foreground samsung galaxy ultra and pro showcased major lack in focus while xiaomis flagship phone offered the highest level of focus and the most natural color representation in zoom levels the best portrait photo are captured by the samsung ultra but wide angle photos were unexpectedly poor lowlight photography is arguably the toughest and most challenging situation for smartphone cameras and once again huaweis pro is the king of the hill albeit its android competitors managed to catch up quite nicely but huaweis flagship probably offers the best main camera due to its low noise ratio in lowlight scenarios
Huawei,P40 Pro,dont talk if you have no idea what are you talking about your comment is just pure bs more destroyed themselves by all means the phone is extremely fast facefigner id unlocking works not only very well but very fast and works each timea lot faster than sultra its just the phone gets no updates mean the rear camera would be more acceptable if the colors were accurate atm they are not and while at night you can take pics that rival daylight it means nothing bcoz if the object is further than like meters it cant focus and the pic quality is junk so only on close range the pics are fine xiaomi mi note can focus at full night on objects like city lights that are few kilometers away gets colors accurate at night too no fancy colors or noise that came from who knows where however did not compare selfie cameras that is not why buy phones with good rear cameras
Huawei,P40 Pro,lul people comparing pro camera to the trash xiaomi mi camera did you even watch reviews more dont talk if you have no idea what are you talking about your comment is just pure bs without any argument you think that simple thing like the brand name can beat another phone your vision is very small to non existang look at tech tablets on mi ultra camera and video review and then come back to say something about the quality at this moment huawei has destroyed their own phones with the latest updates reduced the camera performance especially with the front facing camera you never hold pro in your hands not to mention one
Huawei,P40 Pro,agree httpswwwgsmarenacomvidcmpphpidtypeidphoneidphone more lul people comparing pro camera to the trash xiaomi mi camera did you even watch reviews this phone easily beats brand like that when it comes to camera spec even beat ultra and ip pro max
Huawei,P40 Pro,keep on living in your fantasy world and no after trashed the ppro ordered ultra more you can say whatever you want ill stick with my point observation you stick with yours
Huawei,P40 Pro,wouldnt call that superior on default settings my other phones have slightly more viv more am able to notice the difference when the set the same wallpaper on both the phonesand also the color of the icon seemed better on note litethey are more vivid and vibrant was just curious
Huawei,P40 Pro,just stared using this phone but the screen quality is not that vibrant and colours are not more yeah read the review
Huawei,P40 Pro,great after your statement about bad camera on now weak screen perfect nice bedtime more keep on living in your fantasy world and no after trashed the ppro ordered ultra it has same camera as mi note but its faster and your facts remain theory until you own all phone mentioned its like you are arguing that audi rs is faster than tt rs based on seeing it from miles away but to never have driven it before as daily car mean it is sad you buy ppro thinking it beats other phones as easily as the to did and then you take single pic and all your experience with huawei suddenly has zero value battery optimization is still better than mi note but sound quality is way too far from good its like partially downgrading or not upgrading at all
Huawei,P40 Pro,compared the pictures not reviews on the internet just took pics with the phones and compa more great after your statement about bad camera on now weak screen perfect nice bedtime stories well at least can get rid of it and continue using your perfect camera note
Huawei,P40 Pro,see so your terms come from wiki well just to be precise users do edit and more lol that starts with wiki is just pure sarcasm as have no idea what you are talking about your explanation on previous post regarding on how camera catches light how high res on quad bayer sensor works are wrong entirely so as said dont care what you do for living because at the moment your knowledge explanation about camera are too far fetched basic thing is are way better than note stick with your wrong points ill remain mine by the facts
Huawei,P40 Pro,same camera means not same quality mi pro processor is so bad that it can not han more compared the pictures not reviews on the internet just took pics with the phones and compared them and just today the screen on the ppro broke after fall from like cm it was even in its silicon case and the hit went through the case and shattered the screen cant even remember how many times dropped mi note from higher places this phone is failif not for the face idfingerprint that unlocks the phone quickly
Huawei,P40 Pro,idk about ultra but ultra and it does take pictures slightly better than mi note more same camera means not same quality mi pro processor is so bad that it can not handle the mp so research before you write stupid things mi pro is miles away from pro and ultra
Huawei,P40 Pro,just try to obtain same or better quality than can get with mi note which ppro more bro are you high pro is of course better then mi note pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,xiaomi fans talkin got access to both note pro and mate pro my brother believed that more idk about ultra but ultra and it does take pictures slightly better than mi note so yea both are better than ppro and when you google among them ultra will be equipped with mp primary camera which is the same as that of xiaomi mi note related photos of the samsung galaxy series have been leaked the smallest of them is samsung galaxy with size of mm by mm by mm jan idk samsung seem to get the colors more accurate but slightly and not always however it takes less to process mp picture than mi note of course you have to rethink the whole problem ultra costs more than twice what mi note did at the time of its release if you have read all comments you would know bought mi note just for the camera and did so with pprowhich for now remains failure technically speaking ultra and mi note have exactly same camera so if you take pics in raw format you will be getting exactly same file from both phones
Huawei,P40 Pro,just try to obtain same or better quality than can get with mi note which ppro more just try to obtain same or better quality than can get with mi note which ppro cant achieve even at mp ai and since that is its best mode it makes sense to use that again no mp pixel binned mode are the best optimized one with ai or not if you want to take potato pics you need no ppro any phone that costs of that price will do the same job am very sure producing no potato pics only said that as for how smartphone camera works did programming and fixing electronics for living your understanding of cameras is too simple you did read somewhere some terms and thats it dont care what do for living your explanation regarding on how camera works are totally wrong again and again if think my understanding is too simple yours are twisted around please learn how sensor size lens aperture focal length quad bayer ryyb bmd processing super res algorithm on how it really works starts with wiki
Huawei,P40 Pro,let me guess you using mp mode stick with pixel binned mp resolution for your dail more just try to obtain same or better quality than can get with mi note which ppro cant achieve even at mp ai and since that is its best mode it makes sense to use that if you want to take potato pics you need no ppro any phone that costs of that price will do the same job as for how smartphone camera works did programming and fixing electronics for living your understanding of cameras is too simple you did read somewhere some terms and thats it
Huawei,P40 Pro,did already mentioned that the ppro can not focus at night tried to take pics of tow more let me guess you using mp mode stick with pixel binned mp resolution for your daily pics
Huawei,P40 Pro,yes the amount of pixels is twicemp vs mp what mention are about more did already mentioned that the ppro can not focus at night tried to take pics of town or rather bigger village that was maybe km away it was well lit regardless what did the pics were blurry no prob on mi note could focus it manually or let it do the af could even focus it on objects that were probably more than km away at night huawei better be fixing this could mention that was able to install google street viewwhich keeps on telling me it wont work without google services but it does and it does stitch the pics to photo sphere but just like on the xiaomi the stitching is not perfectunfortunately cant login and cant choose folder to save pics so need to export pics online banking works since day one just needed to clone it all features work same for facebok amazon teamviewer and paypal so if they fix the camera wont complain
Huawei,P40 Pro,on normal usage ppro battery lasts longer than mi note that includes the camera bcoz more yes the amount of pixels is twicemp vs mp what mention are about resolution not sensor size sensor are bit bigger with bigger pixel size in pixelbinned mode as well micron size those are just basic knowledge on camera hardware and you seems fail to understand about it mp whats the use of it if its not using for intermediate zoom digital zoom between each optical lens can get high quality pics at mm without using any dedicated lens sensor like the rest of other brands obvious guess twice the size the physical size is better for catching the light better for catching light sensor are bigger pixel size are bigger plus using ryyb which improves further from other phones for catching light no other phones has low light capabilities wide dynamic range as pmate that can just be taking using auto no need night mode im really scratching my head hearing your explanation
Huawei,P40 Pro,but if turn off the ai the quality will be worse not in my book master ai more on normal usage ppro battery lasts longer than mi note that includes the camera bcoz mp takes more power and more to process it and huawei has the superior batteryapp optimization yes the amount of pixels is twicemp vs mp obvious guess twice the size the physical size is better for catching the light but like said mi note straight out of the box made better pics than ppro now as for master ai master ai is preinstalled camera feature that helps you take better photos by intelligently identifying objects and scenarios and optimizing the camera settings accordingly master ai is able to identify variety of scenes such as stages beaches blue skies greenery and text its more than just colors for text it will look for straight black lines and fix them same with buildings and roads but not to that extreme level as with text so it can process parts of picture differently which for you would mean maybe even hours to get it right and have to disappoint you samsung ultra does better pics than ppro tested just today with friend who just bought it unfortunately didnt had the mi note to compare also liked how the sultra screen scrolling was smoother but it is definitely bigger the few milometers more in size make the sultra too big it also wobbles more on the table than ppro both with silicon case on its just sad you have to hold both phones in order to type messages else you will get annoyed
Huawei,P40 Pro,but if turn off the ai the quality will be worse lol and no mi note does not over more but if turn off the ai the quality will be worse not in my book master ai on add colors contrast boost based on scene detection dont need those extra thing as like to controls my own editing later on most of my photos shot with ai off auto hdr with some of it with pro mode when need certain scene to be exposure locked darken the shadows dont get what do mean with twice the sensor bit bigger note more res but with smaller pixel size and the comparison linkfrom gsm arena come on test it under real life conditions usually without tripod ive seen it real life gave the link just to proof it to you as person owns an actual apsc full frame camera simply dont like the oversmudge details that note image processing has are more neutral to my eye but it is still anyday better than samsung processing day with everything on flagship quality that makes like of all phones to flagship said more than day im heavy user work email coming in and out with lot of camera usage of course note better on that regards as it has bigger battery slower chipset to begin with duh about fps yes the rear fps on my older mate work faster as its physical same as mate but it doesnt effect me much as rather trade it with way way better camera with the rest of other upgrades
Huawei,P40 Pro,guys help me why is my pro dual view in camera app keeps force closing when im opening it emui
Huawei,P40 Pro,maybe bcoz it takes sec longer for sharpening the image those text more but if turn off the ai the quality will be worse lol and no mi note does not over sharpen it doesnt have to it has twice the sensor that ppro has so if it uses it to capture pix at lower resolution it doesnt need to do anything and the comparison linkfrom gsm arena come on test it under real life conditions usually without tripod and day with everything on flagship quality that makes like of all phones to flagship days at least even mi note can do that and here something started with days ago ppro in normal mode wifidata etc are on and the matepro on battery saverit actually shows the precise battery status and how long its on since last charge so far after days hrs the ppro is down to matepro need to mention that barely touched the mateproand got to love the fingerprint scanner on the back it unlocks so fast that even ppro looks old compare to that
Huawei,P40 Pro,in terms of video ppro does best out of all phones owned in terms of pics it could take more maybe bcoz it takes sec longer for sharpening the image those text appear when image stacking auto hdr is happening in certain scene when its needed master ai on or off believe mate has it too might be less aggressive you can always choose not to use it by tap to focus for exposure locked or go to pro mode leave everything in auto the text wont appear as auto hdr dont triggered also failed to understand on what basis mate better than in low light because from what ive seen its the opposite by far details are pure because of the bigger sensor dynamic range are plenty up to stops mate was nowhere near that mean its good on its era but not currently where could not decide which had more details on some spots ppro on some mi note well can easily spot the difference the more details uve seen on note might be just oversharpening check the comparison link share with you earlier the history of the huawei series no comment as it got nothing to do regarding camera quality the same goes to battery life where differences on chipset tech etc are different between those two as long as can get more than day battery life with everything turned on its flagship quality for me
Huawei,P40 Pro,emui fix the purple tint on grey object on certain situation for me no more on that issues more in terms of video ppro does best out of all phones owned in terms of pics it could take nd spot if the light conditions are good well more details on the ppro maybe bcoz it takes sec longer for sharpening the image tested it few times matepro takes pics at low light faster than ppro and ppro take similar time as mi note where could not decide which had more details on some spots ppro on some mi note dont forget that the legend of huawei phones started actually with and mate was at its release one of the best phones out there it still beats ppro on standby time by few and in airplane mode mate pro lasts over days on one charge the mi note on battery saver cant stay on for longer than days if you do not touch the phone disable location disable wifi and disable mobile datai didnt have to do that on the other phones it still takes best pics tho and if you murder all of the phones mentioned play with it until the battery dies mi note will last min hrs for the ppro and hrs for the mate navigating with google maps will be possible for hrs straight on the mi note to be specific it was from luxembourg to st tropezfew weeks before the lockdown
Huawei,P40 Pro,it is unfortunate then hopefully the next major camera id update for in april will improv more maybe youre not using the ffc for video but glad to hear that for you everything is ok
Huawei,P40 Pro,thank you for the answres unfortunetely the ffc is still very bad when recording videos indoo more it is unfortunate then hopefully the next major camera id update for in april will improve on that specific situation as for me that issue have no effect on my style of usage
Huawei,P40 Pro,not sure dont remember how the original quality ff indoor situation was as barely use it more thank you for the answres unfortunetely the ffc is still very bad when recording videos indoors almost unusable even with emui checked my phone yesterday
Huawei,P40 Pro,no change to pic quality at least since december if that answers your question no they more thank you for the reply
Huawei,P40 Pro,hi mate can you please tell me if they fixed the camera or the video quality is still more he asking about ff camera video quality especially on indoor environment
Huawei,P40 Pro,hi mate can you please tell me if they fixed the camera or the video quality is still very ba more not sure dont remember how the original quality ff indoor situation was as barely use it on that specific occasion but for sure on newer emui ota updates certain things looks better on the rear cam photography wise
Huawei,P40 Pro,yea own it sine few months and since also the xiaomi mi note which made better pics more ive own several of sony xperias flagship before honor pro mate after that currently sorry based on my observation its the best yet which covers lot of focal length hybrid optical with minor loss in quality httpsmgsmarenacompiccmpphpidtypeidphoneidphoneidphone mi note is great camera no doubt but dont like the oversmudge details processing that they have still better than what samsung has done also in what ways mate are better than can be sure that its better than my previous mate by far yes sometimes color science using main ryyb sensor can be bit miss on certain scenarios but it takes on details are splendid colors can easily adjusted using hsl adjustment later on but cannot recover details besides its improving over the time with certain updates
Huawei,P40 Pro,what which photo colors not accurate at low light fyi those finalized image edited by me more hi mate can you please tell me if they fixed the camera or the video quality is still very bad like until now thanks if they fix the problem may go back to my pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,seeing those picturesyea ppro cant get the colors right especially in low light more what which photo colors not accurate at low light fyi those finalized image edited by me based on my style preferences bit of color hsl adjustment all of those are not sooc no update regarding camera received bunch of it already own the device this april mate will receive major camera id upgrade after launching
Huawei,P40 Pro,street photography shoot out recent photos taken using huawei mate before that more seeing those picturesyea ppro cant get the colors right especially in low light conditions the camera had barely any updates or optimization guess its about time they fix it
Huawei,P40 Pro,sa feb guys am having notification problems with the following apps on my ppro whatsapp yahoo more think those talking about whatsapp messages not popping up untill you check your whatsapp havent changed the settings you change the settings for apps and pop ups
Huawei,P40 Pro,no eod needs hardwaresupport that pro doesnt have that is exclusive to mate more either it use more advance depth sensor module kirin npu or that feature exclusively for mate only
Huawei,P40 Pro,hi there is eyes on display eod support in pro after update any pubg player who more no no
Huawei,P40 Pro,guys am having notification problems with the following apps on my ppro whatsapp yahoo mail whats app sometimes the notification comes through as normal at times my phone will be quiet until manually log into whatsapp only to find my messages comes through on yahoo mail app get no notification at all any advice or assistance step by step anyone else experience the above
Huawei,P40 Pro,jackm feb simple buy yourself proper decent slr camera and not complain on forum about one that more you should read my conversation with the other guy from the very beginning before jumping into conclusion actually its not complaining more about suggestion improvement yes im very very happy with my its the best phone ive ever own when it comes into camera and yes do have two mirrorless camera
Huawei,P40 Pro,understand about stabilization gimbal works better if no stabilization applied into the phon more simple buy yourself proper decent slr camera and not complain on forum about one that is shoved into ph hence phone hello
Huawei,P40 Pro,you should research back about mi issue what im talking about the way he did night more thanks for the suggestions will never buy iphone since dont like it bit saw that most of the problems on mi can be fixed with software updates but will wait until it is property tested never buy phones the moment they come out or pre order strange that they did that and its stupid also since dont use gimbals but what can you do anyway mi ultra or plus even if it is not the as it should supposed to be
Huawei,P40 Pro,really havent heard of those problems yet well guess he is not pro like though more you should research back about mi issue what im talking about the way he did night mode in photos in videos huawei only pixel binned at fps mode pixel size huawei also disable stabilization in fps mode both in likely an option for people to use gimbal on that mode if care so much about videography without any much hassle suggest an iphone not the best stabilization not the best when it comes to dof huawei superior because bigger sensor but near to none jittery both in daylight lowlight even older iphone good on that regards that said mi ultra still great option
Huawei,P40 Pro,ive seen the comparison video lots of mate features are left out first ff vide more really havent heard of those problems yet well guess he is not pro like thought he is and disagree with him saying that the ultra has the best when even an amateur can see that it is oversharpening true about the boke he even admited he didnt turned it on and dont know why he didnt turned it on and take another one about night mode turned on when taking videos have no idea but the way he took the video the quality was very bad if they get google back they will become number again for the moment my attention goes to mi ultra my pro is still in its box collecting dust
Huawei,P40 Pro,you can search the comparison made by chris from tech tablets and you will see that mi ultr more ive seen the comparison video lots of mate features are left out first ff video he doesnt use the normal wide fl which is on that format stabilizer are enabled and will be fair with other fl with wider versatility he also doesnt mention how good its dr is on that comparison second ff portrait he doesnt turn on the bokeh mode into circle therefore no bokeh appear on mate third yes stability wider fl not the best using uwa but he doesnt mention that mate has the biggest sensor better quality fourth is he using night mode all the time when comparing low lights lots of reviewer does mate doesnt need to use night mode and still beat others finally all ultra does are oversharpen things yet hes saying its the most details he maybe good at comparing smartphone camera but lack of knowledge about actual camera does which what huawei leica camera are aim at mi ultra is great though same as my first initial thought and about mi uve talked earlier currently its suffer from tons of throttling and heat issue lots of reviewer confirms about it and in my opinion mi ultra camera are lot better than mi camera setup
Huawei,P40 Pro,agree about mi ultra hardware used are very good big sensor from uwa main telephot more you can search the comparison made by chris from tech tablets and you will see that mi ultra took over mate pro in some conditions am not pro but he is maybe for you video doesnt matter but for most of us it does lot but like you said to each its own considering the huge performance xiaomi has gained with photo and video huawei phones will go down even more but remains to be seen
Huawei,P40 Pro,its good then it seems that huawei finally listened to their customers know it more agree about mi ultra hardware used are very good big sensor from uwa main telephoto first time for xiaomi but not the rest like said thats videography only which is not my genre photography wise huawei leica image algorithm great quality lens are the one chose really satisfied to each its own
Huawei,P40 Pro,its only affecting the ff video indoors and guess what yesterday received ota update more its good then it seems that huawei finally listened to their customers know its about the indoors one and even if it doesnt matter for some it matters to me currently using poco and its very good for the price paid and am waiting for mi to come to europe or will import mi ultra xiaomi is not what it was in the past anymore and in video comparison it bested mate pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,night mode seems to be better after last update december patch nice
Huawei,P40 Pro,there is no quality degradation on pro youre mistaken just confirmed camera qua more chill im just asking the guy for his opinion as havent update to emui on that time anyway already update to emui the only decrease quality that im aware of is when using ff video in indoorlow light its like worse lol its not affecting me much as im using it mainly more into photography rear cams and on that regards think emui has much better quality no more magenta color cast in certain lighting condition so im all good httpswwwinstagramcomshuibullahamran my ig profile newer photos are taken using my love it
Huawei,P40 Pro,camera quality decreasing is normal for almost all brands used and still using samsung phon more night mode seems to be better after last update december patch
Huawei,P40 Pro,its great love it dont need google ty
Huawei,P40 Pro,chill out want this device in the future lol am very chill you asked and told you why good luck with wasting money and finding solutions non stop to have normal phone
Huawei,P40 Pro,read the previous conversations and you will understand why no need to write the same thing more chill out want this device in the future lol
Huawei,P40 Pro,great mobile btw all apps from the old mobile was transferred to pro and the only netflix was not working but after installing from another market is working perfectly
Huawei,P40 Pro,so my wife has transitioned from pro to pro earlier this week and the change was more straightforeward than we expected phone clone took less than mins of the apps that were copied access only wear os failed to work some complained about google play services not being available but worked anyhow petal maps was not installed by default but now seems to work ok the device received software updates totalling around gb ending up with emui setting the huawei id was little awkward so off to good start less adverts it seems
Huawei,P40 Pro,amazing device great battery life very good screen amazing cameras and photo quality did not have any trouble with update and quality of photos lack of gms is flaw but it can be bypassed by lot of apps and little bit of work around have had android one phone before this and didnt have any trouble changing the os
Huawei,P40 Pro,guys im experiencing heavy battery drainage on xperia xz just bought it is nd hand and they upgraded it to oreo eish can someone assist me here another problem is its battery is non replaceble
Huawei,P40 Pro,excellent device best camera in the world and excellent hardware dont need google
Huawei,P40 Pro,being confused with cameraphone nomination was going through the cameraphone reviews more what about the camera pictures and videos quality after the software update everybody is complaining about that currently have the pro and am suffering from the same issue
Huawei,P40 Pro,things happens experienced worst on bunch of sony xperia flagship phone worst quality afte more man am tired of waiting for nothing had oneplus but back when it was after that had sammy lg motorola etc never iphone dont get whats the point of ruinning something that works very well anyway if you dont forget about this post keep me update if they fixed the problem like said before my pro is its in own box never going to use it again until they fix the apps problem
Huawei,P40 Pro,seeim on emui now newer than you have dont know was it worse or not more they are focusing on and mate series now series are thing of the past in my region there is no sign of emui not that care too much now since the phone is rutting in its own box am super disappointed with huawei for this trash they are doing plus what have discussed with the other dude you will never find out from customer support center you can only find out from people that are not biased to brand like myself and the other dude in the past felt sorry for what they are going thru but now they deserve the things that are happening to them worthless company that scams their loyal customers
Huawei,P40 Pro,feel like both photo and video specially in lower light situation has got decreased by time more seeim on emui now newer than you have dont know was it worse or not than yours after bought directly update still better quality than my older mate though bigger sensor duh got notification about emui update then bump to this issue of yours luckily gave feedback on this thread good community job have done here well guess just have to stick with at the moment until newer emui fix those issue
Huawei,P40 Pro,yeah and it should not supposed to be like that you have to change to older update as latest more may know what is the real issue about the decrease camera quality after some updates photography related videography related or just affecting front facing camera thanks lot for the feedback
Huawei,P40 Pro,yeah dude understand you for me have flashed custom roms since young boy so its some more thanks for the info gone are the days when changed roms on my phone now passed those moments and they will not return have other interests now if put my mind to it can do it for sure and it will all come back to me but like said dont do this anymore and its too much trouble plus need phone that works out of the box since use my phone heavy and dont have time to test different roms to settle upon one and this is temporary solution it would fix the problem and least but not least know that in todays world updates ruin everything most of the time have seen it on my own products way to many times
Huawei,P40 Pro,its too much really already have limited time and to spend my free time doings hacks more yeah dude understand you for me have flashed custom roms since young boy so its some normal thing to understand that updates always wont make your experience better have always told about windows too how bad it is for real and wish could install windows back but its impossible as having newer hardware requires btw recommend you to check vivo iqoo pro as it has custom samsung gn camera sensor and charges in minutes from might change this pro to that one day
Huawei,P40 Pro,no problem changed my mind for now about selling this pro away as manually updated fi more its too much really already have limited time and to spend my free time doings hacks all the time on my phone no thanks just need normal phone this phone doesnt offer anything else special to bother so much with it totally not worth it looking forward to find pro which is much better than this
Huawei,P40 Pro,good luck man wish could sell mine also but nobody wants to buy it since it has no goog more no problem changed my mind for now about selling this pro away as manually updated firmwares and found best one for this from older ones have now emui july as that update has eye tracking feature added to front camera and overall image quality is very good like supposed to be and not blurry videos in the dark as tested downgraded from emui to latest emui fw and downgraded once to emui via huawei proxy tool and updated to upper version and that one has working ota updates as it wants to update again to bad firmware but wont let it do that hope help ya fix the camera problem it sounds hard steps but you can follow on youtube those gsm fix steps and you will enjoy again your pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,yeah this is incredible really bought poco nfc to use hoping that fix or somethi more yeah im with ya with this camera one so you are not lunatic whatsoever too bad for huawei as they do this im gonna sell my pro away too and will jump to apple world as they are stable even they dont innovative like android phones in hardware wise looking for iphone or pro to buy as they has better value than new serie ready to sacrifice after having no google
Huawei,P40 Pro,im really unhappy with the restrictions on the pro had no idea the apps use dont work gmail with several accounts track solid using play services
Huawei,P40 Pro,youll get the update very soon im using the same model from india ive more im from sri lanka received th of december
Huawei,P40 Pro,yeah dude tell me more its shame as pro has some beast hardware inside like bigge more yeah this is incredible really bought poco nfc to use hoping that fix or something will come but it seems with the new updates its getting worse and worse tried talking to people online but some either have no clue about it and it seems normal to them or they are dumb fanboys that are not able to have normal conversation anyway at this moment the makes selfie videos indoor times better than pro its basically useless indoors and make lot of video selfies thanks lot for sharing the info with me thought was crazy and the only one that was having this issue the only way to make it look bit better but just bit better is to turn on beauty mode to and it becomes bit more usable but your face looks like cartoon will try to sell this garbage phone and buy something else never going to buy huawei phone again even my mate pad pro with its mp ffc is more usable indoor than this one with huawei deserves the fate their having for doing this to their loyal customers
Huawei,P40 Pro,the so will definitely stay away from their phones from now on it means that those more yeah dude tell me more its shame as pro has some beast hardware inside like biggest camera sensor of but my old lg outputs sharper pictures than pro so there is something wrong for real took some videos of my fireworks at new years eve and those videos looks like they has been taken by some cheap potato cuz emui had so bad quality in camera it is just shame but now every picture take look like their supposed to be as having old emui now with old af security patches tbh
Huawei,P40 Pro,it might be faulty device the camera on my pro is super goodphotos and video when more disagree cuz its newer updates reason have owned huawei pros and updates has decreased image quality can compare older pics by older updates with newer ones see on redskull youtube channel where he comments on some pro camera comparison videos how updates has make this camera worse its weird move from huawei say
Huawei,P40 Pro,guys same here the video quality from the mp camera at low light inside house is brutally more it might be faulty device the camera on my pro is super goodphotos and video when compared to my previous phonespoco oneplus and samsung
Huawei,P40 Pro,hey guys can confirm that image quality in the common has decreased by newer updates it might be cuz huawei is using wrong algorithms in our pro maybe focusing now more on mate pro camera installed from may of with may patches and image quality is top notch in that firmware version when comparing newest updates downgraded emui to emui first with hisuite and downgraded one more time with hisuite from newest emui to older one followed carefully steps on youtube how to do that on gsm fix channel how to downgrade pro firmware please be careful when downgrade fw stuff as you can brick your phone have experienced that so follow all the steps well

Huawei,P40 Pro,hello have iphone xs max is worth change for pro if you dont use google that much then yes if you do then thats iffy
Huawei,P40 Pro,not in the new firmware version there probably will be one soon
Huawei,P40 Pro,unfortunately with the new firmware no method currently works with pro to install the gmsunless you are willing to hack the hisuite and downgrade your phone to an earlier version of firmware
Huawei,P40 Pro,maps work normally but you cant sign in so you wont be able to get personalised more google maps is working and you can also sign in got all my locations marked as favs from my trips on maps again in fact everything with google dependency works you just need the specific emui version to install it and after that its all pretty much fine gmail photos chrome bookmarks and more are okay

Huawei,P40 Pro,have ppro it works fine with me but seem cant use waze it says keep searching network more the reason that your waze keeps searching network should be that you havent allowed the application waze to access your phone location
Huawei,P40 Pro,waze works fine on my new huawei pro you can install it from petal search or copy it from you old phone through huawei phone clone
Huawei,P40 Pro,overall huawei has very good phone spec with reasonable budgets but at the moment the price still at peak for all phones maker due to high gst tax for all goods if sold outside china only in china you can get cheaper price than retails price outside country also they came with two variants global rom china rom at the moment huawei has no access to global rom global has google preinstalledenable the trade ban for huawei last for year and it will be end on may us gov will open new contract to continue business with huawei if they agreed to us gov tc for now other brands china wont effected only huawei banned so you all dont need to worried now alot huawei users phones has been resell back for used price due to google banned using huawei at this crisis moment are very bad choice if you active in business that using google for kids they know nothing they said no google have life goodluck with that kids only know to play games but find money they dont
Huawei,P40 Pro,explain better pls well petal search is an app huawei developed so they can give apps that are not available in huawei app gallery from rd party app store like aptitode etc it gives almost all apps that are available from google play store and it gives proper updates to apps and make sure its safe anyway there are few apps that really need gms that dont work like google drive and some rare banking apps
Huawei,P40 Pro,peta search is search engine by huawei that allows you on top of browsing the internet also more petal
Huawei,P40 Pro,install petal search from huawei appgalllery you can install all apps using petal search no more explain better pls
Huawei,P40 Pro,camera monster the best camera currently in the market the pros camera resolution more install petal search from huawei appgalllery you can install all apps using petal search no need gms and google play
Huawei,P40 Pro,in this current situation is it worth buying pro over samsung or apple know it offers more is great phone overall the new hms system is not bad at all many people didnt tried it or are just afraid to switch to it myself thougth that its not gonna work but was suprised im using lite and every app is working finemessenger whatsup viber mobile banking apps etc apps that are most used
Huawei,P40 Pro,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkafjzcpxtafeaturesharefbclidiwarlhawiaxuaerkhwymvnqcikegpmimjbyaubxnxbcmgawulfvtuk just do this and your fine
Huawei,P40 Pro,google chrome google translate google keyboard youtube vanced probably more but only more it all works on my
Huawei,P40 Pro,like huawei all the device specialy latest models but sad thing is there is no google play for download my favourite apps hopefully huawei will back all the famous apps in their app store waiting for that and buy for this stylist device my family everyone are using huawei mobile lite and honor lite am waiting for once apps is available will buy this device cant wait morehuawei please back apps
Huawei,P40 Pro,deleted post let us keep politic away from this because people that buy apple help to build american too well let keep politic away from this come back to huawei pro think huawei did great job with this phone and hopefully they will get android
Huawei,P40 Pro,deleted post do you buy mobile to support someonesomething or for your ease and personal use pffff
Huawei,P40 Pro,which google apps work on pro without side load gms google chrome google translate google keyboard youtube vanced probably more but only need these
Huawei,P40 Pro,that is no big deal it will effect only smartphones with google services and think they wil more its just matter of time before huawei really takes over
Huawei,P40 Pro,just switched cell from samsung galaxy to huawei pro copied all the apps from the old more also bought last week pro have everything need and don really need google play services there is still life without google
Huawei,P40 Pro,think price of this phone with out google play should be aout us
Huawei,P40 Pro,huawei temporary permission expired all smartphones now without updates is it coming now more that is no big deal it will effect only smartphones with google services and think they will renew that license again for new devices that comes with hms its not at all problem because it uses android open source so it will get all security updates and all updates the only downside of using android open source is the manufacturer dont get the major update before hand that means for huawei emui it will take more time to develop because when android launches at that time only huawei will get source code for other manufacturers they will get at beta stage so that they can develop there skins before tge official launch and they can push updates earlier and android open source is free it can be used by anyone thats how huawei used android when america banned google from licensing android if you use android open source you cant use google services so they came up with hms and so far they are going well sure it will take time to get all apps that were available on play store but it will get it sooner
Huawei,P40 Pro,can it use for longterm without side loading gms
Huawei,P40 Pro,hello guys does on pro notification work for messages on instagram viber messenger more all work save for twitter notifications
Huawei,P40 Pro,is the pro dual sim dual active yes
Huawei,P40 Pro,hi guys feel need to be brutally honest after just dropping shy of grand on phone this phone has an amazing camera but apps are the issue for this phone can not get my banking apps spotify without petal just the most basic of things you have to go all around the houses and back again just to get what you want its so upsetting that in we have this issue am regrettably sending it back for an plus
Huawei,P40 Pro,in my country pro gb cost same as iphone gb price so is it worth buying more ppro is far better phone than ip
Huawei,P40 Pro,dought weather you used this phone in settings when you take digital wellbeing at down of more dont bother about applesamsung fanboy let them bark we all know that this phone is wonderful am not saying that apple and samsung are not good but must admit that this pro is so waow
Huawei,P40 Pro,pos phone got one for th birthday and it has lot of bloatware and spyware that is unr more dought weather you used this phone in settings when you take digital wellbeing at down of the screen there is big option button to disable digital wellbeing and same for assistant just open your eyes before commenting
Huawei,P40 Pro,just bought my pro silver and cant express my happiness the only hic for now is the nano memory card which need to buy and which is not that cheap secondly the screen is not as vividbright as samsung phone but else waow all apps am downloading from petal serach works flawlessly
Huawei,P40 Pro,really planning to buy same but heard many positive reviews whereby most apps are working ca more well you can install play store then every app should work perfectly otherwise its like different country different situationi have nova dont personally installed play store every app works perfectly for me but in my country many banking apps is already there in app gallery thats why had no problem but its different for different countries just list all your apps that you use and check weather its available in app gallery there is huawei app gallery website check in that as of now there are no big apps like facebook insta and all stuff but there other app called petal search helped me with every app that want so there was no use of play store for me personally but this is my case so definitely ask to someone in your country and feel free to ask if you have any problem
Huawei,P40 Pro,personally had pro year ago and had no screen protection the phone did not have the more can you name those devices just to know what to avoid im still using galaxy sfor years doesent have single scratch on it
Huawei,P40 Pro,does fast charging work with screen on according to wikipedia some samsung phones disable fast charging during screenon very frustrating
Huawei,P40 Pro,jul source on better scratch resistance personally had pro year ago and had no screen protection the phone did not have the slightest scratch while other devices with gorilla glass were destroyed by scratches

Huawei,P40 Pro,this is none sense have huawei phone and it is fantastic if you dont have huawei plea more have you been able to install the apps lik whatsapp instagram youtube tiktok etc on it
Huawei,P40 Pro,its better to charge with regular charger and use fast charger as needed because higher more as mate pro user will answer about the battery used mate pro for year and charged it until below mostly below once month from to for battery calibration used accubattery and it shows have battery health and got about hours sot with hours gaming on and hours in wifi so think it didnt affect the battery at all
Huawei,P40 Pro,in comparison with iphone pro max which is one better to buy money is not consideration more the pro is the best camera phone you can buy probably the iphone pro max is the best phone you can buy period good luck with either
Huawei,P40 Pro,deleted post this is none sense have huawei phone and it is fantastic if you dont have huawei please dont comment this phone is the best phone
Huawei,P40 Pro,deleted post guess have not even use pro if you can see clearly and think with clear head you will know why trump wanna ban hua wei they are too strong to hold which scare his balls out
Huawei,P40 Pro,am so mad abt the phone went to shop and hold that phone its just waow lil big for me but its amazing only the google app missing is holding me back grrrrrr
Huawei,P40 Pro,perfect phone liked the night mode the photos like brighter than samsungs ultra ultras night mode not good reverse wireless charging perfect too charged just my old iphone plus too without problems
Huawei,P40 Pro,did someone buy it is camera as good as dxomark and other reviewers say yes camera is excelent huawei is still step in front of competiton
Huawei,P40 Pro,my sister bought huawei ppro abt months ago ago and she was taught how to install google too before switching it she was using huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro,huawei is laking flash light for selfie camera stereo in speakers sound and more and aptx hdi really can understand whycd quality over bluetooth is must for any mid range plus phone let alone one thats bragging its the phone of the year
Huawei,P40 Pro,bought stand in xiaomi until decent all round gr came about not at totally stupid money thought this would be the one but it doesnt have aptx hd wtf
Huawei,P40 Pro,oh please enough with that you can install google play store on this phone just check how in more this phone is good but not good too just like that
Huawei,P40 Pro,can add more google accounts via more apps cause by using the method of tranfsering google more you can make new account go it settings look for user add new user and enjoy
Huawei,P40 Pro,what can say just won this phone huawei pro and euro via playing lords mobilegame enjoy my gift from huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro,are not from eu becouse huawei sells great here in europe work in cellphone repair in europe since huawei got bad mouthed by mass media huawei flag ships barely come in for repair anymore cheap huawei phones still get repaired more often but also less than before huawei ban biggest problem with huawei is they are now not using gorilla glass even on euro phones gorilla glass is must
Huawei,P40 Pro,huawei year performance behind plus no google services but still selling at flagship price oo
Huawei,P40 Pro,email app probably dont work with gmail at least for me it did not work but if you use gmail can use outlook outlook also works with google calendar use gmx because of the gdpr and smooth integration with mozilla thunderbird gmx cloud also provides up to gigs online storage if it is activated by installing the apps and win apps it can be deinstalled if not needed afterwards
Huawei,P40 Pro,they sell badly over here in europe thats why the keep renewing their old phones pro more are not from eu becouse huawei sells great here in europe
Huawei,P40 Pro,they really out here flexing that imx sensor kudos
Huawei,P40 Pro,huawei makes nice flagship phones they give very good camera even their network quality more oh please enough with that you can install google play store on this phone just check how in youtube own this phone so far this phone is the best phone better then samsung better then iphone better then oneplus and xiaomi
Huawei,P40 Pro,phones are getting expensive day by day spending such huge money behind phone which will be older after year is not good ideaspecifically during this covid pandemic lots of people are losing their jobs now the people need money to eat not to show off with this fancy thing
Huawei,P40 Pro,srsly look at that ppi and resolution huawei what do you do there downgrading phones
Huawei,P40 Pro,wow and you worked all that out by yourself such blatantly obvious post jeez its an opinion as opposite to your comment that is useless
Huawei,P40 Pro,believe the description saying no play services is misleading as only few countries have banned it in australia where am huawei devices still have full access to google play
Huawei,P40 Pro,is it possible to root pro and install stock android and along with play store
Huawei,P40 Pro,if your iq is high enough you can use almost everything on an pro exactly you said well people are not that smart enough thats why they are saying that no gms means smartphone is useless bt they dont know every android app can run on the latest huaweihonor devices by just side loading
Huawei,P40 Pro,great mobile with super specs mobile performance can be compared with iphone it has much better camera rest of the spec are similiar but if want to take photos then should pick up pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,oneplus pro if you are student you probably shouldnt buy an all out flagship for premium price so go for the oneplus pro
Huawei,P40 Pro,hey guys ive been saving up money for really long time and im troubled with what phone to more suggest either you buy ppro or wait for ppro or matepro for the following reasons if you want to flagship and keep it for while you should get one that offers significant technology and user experience no other phonemakers are capable of offering in the near future for flagship you should never buy smartphone without periscope optical zoom once you have used one you will never want another phone without it matepro will deliver some major breakthroughs in camera lens technology no other phonemakers are capable of offering in the near future
Huawei,P40 Pro,no play store no tq put play store back many people and my friend complaining after buying nova huawei yp
Huawei,P40 Pro,bought it yesterday tried to use it but it is simply not possible apps that used to do more why cry now you already knew about it its your mistake
Huawei,P40 Pro,for with freebuds and wireless charger its the best deal on smartphone period where is that deal thats insanei mean the phone itself is worth its price with all specs it has and to get freebuds aswell dont even need to think about taking that
Huawei,P40 Pro,ok dont care plus didnt ask this would have been great opinion if anyone actually asked
Huawei,P40 Pro,oh the camera cut out hurts me while looking it ok dont care plus didnt ask
Huawei,P40 Pro,android is perfectly fine platform for mobile phone softver it does come without google app more yes the problem has no application auto update let say we have apps on my huawei pro it can handle all apps to be updated
Huawei,P40 Pro,roni bangladesh may price very high price is more than justified as according to dxomark it has best camera on the market atm which is just continued process vy huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro,very happy with it could install whatsapp and chrome and using most google apps from chrome more hi am wondering if you have been able to download any uk banking apps onto the phone please bear in mind that those apps are on the playstore and will not work without google services
Huawei,P40 Pro,what type of glass is on this phone corning gorilla glass or its aluminosilicate glass like on pro information by huawei service and it is very good glass with high resistance scratching
Huawei,P40 Pro,price very high
Huawei,P40 Pro,of course google owns android its their software you should stop talking about things you have zero knowledge of save some sympathy for yourself ok
Huawei,P40 Pro,but it is not qhd display you can call it qhd because it consists of quad of you can certainly call hd if sony call its screen right
Huawei,P40 Pro,great phone amazing camera and personally love the design battery is excellent and the pho more this phone is brilliant it has the best photography have ever seen especially like the night photo mode
Huawei,P40 Pro,android as such can be installed by any smartphone manufacturer on its devices without the need for authorization from googlebut the google services belong to googleindeed within google services we will find the google play store with its applications available to users youtube gmail google photosetc google mapsetc to get these google services manufacturers need to get license from google and adhere to lot of specific rules it is strange to ask who owns an open source project since by its nature it is meant to have no owners but rather contributors hosts and maintainers nobody owns android google is the largest contributor but it chooses to give away all of its contributions not to be confused with google proprietary applications which are available for android iphone symbian etc so the answer is that everybody and nobody owns android
Huawei,P40 Pro,this year is the same best photo smartphone by tipa world awards well they also won first no google seduced company haha its like when we remove ios from apple phones
Huawei,P40 Pro,android os is an opensource project which belongs to the whole community involved in this pro more of course google owns android its their software
Huawei,P40 Pro,well in past years huawei always won awards for best camera phones this year is the same best photo smartphone by tipa world awards
Huawei,P40 Pro,agreed there is no perfect phone every phone has its flaw but it all comes down to what more well in past years huawei always won awards for best camera phones
Huawei,P40 Pro,nubia red magic is way better in some aspects but this would and should be the best flagship more agreed there is no perfect phone every phone has its flaw but it all comes down to what do you want and what do you need camera is the most popular part of the phone for most of the people and huawei did rly awesome job to cover that part more than anyone else
Huawei,P40 Pro,does anyone knows if supercharger effect battery health and should charge the phone wit re more its better to charge with regular charger and use fast charger as needed because higher current produces more heat and heat reduces battery life heres more how to prolong the life of your battery pack keep these tips in mind for proper lithiumion or lipo battery carethe lifespan of your battery should last between charge and discharge cyclesdepending on the manufacturercan be longer which usually amounts to yearsin short if want my battery to last longer should not charge it above and not let it discharge below battery level at this range you receive the best balance of depth of discharge and runtime if you stay in this zone you can maximize your battery use and retain that healthy battery life for much longer timeliion and lipo batteries are designed to perform its best between percent and percent capacity so once the battery hits lower than feel free to charge your smartphone already likewise once the charge hits percent you really dont need to wait for your phone to reach percent anymore you can check this in battery power consumption details battery usage and you will see how this cycle does not count hereso it will not ruin the cyclesthink of you battery as the human body throughout the day you dont really need to wait like youre about to die to take some rest and recharge yourself and you also dont need perfect eight or nine hour sleep to be able to function at full capacity but you have not done so much damage by charging up to just do not leave it on the charger when it reaches its worse when its completely empty and what most threatens the battery life is the heat
Huawei,P40 Pro,something you messed uphere is huawei pro not in addition suggest you to visit dxomark camera review
Huawei,P40 Pro,forgot about display is first display that have scratches in mobile device ever had since dont remember never used any screen protector special covers or cases in lumia xl iphone never opened iphone received as gift im apple user since so know their weaknesses right now im trying to restore ipad pro drama ppro would be finished times during same time
Huawei,P40 Pro,ppro is the best phone ive ever had but the worst camera ive ever got too much sharpening smoothing no memory of your own settings delayed shutter release taking picture of child in jump is miracle in the position you want nokia after year of inactivity turn on the camera has ev which set all settings and does what it wants despite its limitations such as lack of exposure time control but everything can be mastered even sports photography perfectly selected image parameters mpx files are more natural and detailed than with the full ppro resolution if you want to take good pictures you need to do raw and spend some time processing forget about sport so the shutter is slow in lumia xl you can do rawy in series up to frames ah and lot of vignetting in rawa video the same too much edge sharpening embellishing smoothing the pro option is joke make movies in program from the snopp gimbal lower bitrate and better quality even than filmic pro which bought and returned there is no simple function called in nokia hyperfocal which gives sharp image from meters to infinity very useful for quick photos ppro is very inaccurate thats all no but other than that love this phone all day on two sim cards with data and gps plus photo and video enabled cool but take the lumiexl with me because its faster and gives better pictures of raw jpg is also tragic here nokia was years ahead of the world there is still no competition there is no
Huawei,P40 Pro,so many comments about gms am not aware of any recent android phones that you cant put gms more agree know that we are all used on haveing gms already installed on your phone with purchase but as you said just because it is not installed doesnt mean that we cant use google apps on this phone this phone is absolutely great and its performances are stunning so there is no reason why anybody wouldnt buy this phone because of gms issue
Huawei,P40 Pro,well its true haha mean apart from shape and color have one of the best cameras in the wo more they know where to hit
Huawei,P40 Pro,two among the most popular topics related to ppro in various forums are which color do more well its true haha mean apart from shape and color have one of the best cameras in the world people are using camera more often now and want to have better pitcures camera is too good on pro and thats also one of the many reasons why phone will sell good
Huawei,P40 Pro,bought pro its getting overheat when we use camera for more than min or when we do any video chat for min camera portion gets overheating even golden snap cinematic pics remove reflection options are not coming in the camera editing option so very much disappointed return it to the company for fixing it or replacement
Huawei,P40 Pro,gms its not apart of android os then how your phone runs android os that own by google android os is an opensource project which belongs to the whole community involved in this project google doesnt own android os google is the caretaker of this open source project and responsible for putting inputs from all parties together and integrate them into the final synthesis the stable version of this final synthesis opensourceandroid is then put into deposit where every party in this community can use smartphonemaker can integrate its own addons with this opensourceandroid and put the final result android on its smartphone for sale many tier and tier phonemakers have been doing this for years because they dont want to pay google for the right to preinstall gms samsung pays google billions of dollars for the right to preinstall gms more than android smartphones sold legally in the world are free from gms including many indiabased phonemakers they are lowprofile and lowerpriced phones most people are not aware of gms is an addon essential to google apps but not essential to android os gms comes with some opensource libraries many apps are compiled against these libraries leaving the impressions that those apps are dependent on gms which is false the phonemaker can start its own zms mobile service with those opensource libraries and asks those developers to recompile their apps against the libraries included in zms then those apps can run just as effectively on android zms can be developed completely independently and
Huawei,P40 Pro,no mm jack no stereospeakers no buy
Huawei,P40 Pro,need an opinion from you all will your guys purchase huaweis flagship that does not has gms more im using lite currently and its not big deal after all apps such as messenger viber wattapp can transfer via phone clone and other apps can download via rd party appapkpure updates come normaly and nothing crashes
Huawei,P40 Pro,just receive an ad for preorder here in indonesia pro gb is just idr more wow for only that must be the best buy out of any phones for sure im sure that those preorders will dissapear fast go catch that preorder fastwhile its still available
Huawei,P40 Pro,after having this phone and using it in eu for week can give some pointers for anyone who is considering to buy it the display is absolutely gorgeous and the curve angles on sides is big plus for corner swiping honestly forgot about the big punch whole in day and dont even notice it anymore its not problem for me face unlock works even in dark its perfect backdoor installment of google services works mostly well there are few apps which do not work or partially work local swedbank app partially works can make transactions and see all info but nfc payment does not work invalid token error smart id app works ok but does not pop up for notifications invalid token error bitwarden password manager not autofilling all fields correctly netflix not available the rest including uber bolt google maps voice assistant etc all work as usual the cameras of this phone are impressive and work fine with stock camera app filmic pro works but has been buggy for now hopefully its developers will solve all issues soon
Huawei,P40 Pro,use common sense the nubia is gaming smartphone not regular flagship and both phones ca more most regular gaming phones are just flgship phones with cooling upgrade
Huawei,P40 Pro,witout doubt one of the best mobile phones that the market has to offer each segment is perfected and the camera makes this device even more special
Huawei,P40 Pro,the hole punch is absolutely disgusting cant look at this phone without thinking about it
Huawei,P40 Pro,everything almost defeat from ultra ram video sound no stereo no protection display and the pro costs the price of the ultra the ultra is overpriced and even the chipset and cameras cannot keep up with the pro fingerprint sensor is also lame and facial recognition useless even ultra costs more than gb iphone pro max and not necessarily better
Huawei,P40 Pro,you know what fkr camera you should keep in middle itself nowadays gamers are buying in inc more that wouldnt be problem in settings of display can choose between leaving punch hole or turning the top of the screen black exactly where the camera is it will hide the camera with the black line and can play ur game without getting distracted by camera
Huawei,P40 Pro,yea but is more scure and it isnt too slow it takes little more time than unlock but more face unlock or is way less secure compared to fingerprint unlock which in turn is less secure to good ol pattern unlock
Huawei,P40 Pro,at euro this phone is little underpriced for the eu market in terms of design build more yes huawei rocks
Huawei,P40 Pro,ds faster than ds face unlock for example oneplus or oneplus pro with the pop up camera yea but is more scure and it isnt too slow it takes little more time than unlock but get safer and more secure phone
Huawei,P40 Pro,will it have google no it will not it comes without gms and only hms so yea google aplications wont be preinstaled on the phone as you buy it
Huawei,P40 Pro,excuse me you missed one thing that front camera also can record video yes exactly front camera can film in either or fps in uhd or so called resolution
Huawei,P40 Pro,cell phone on overhang the bad thing is that it has the same battery of the pro and the same the fast charge inch fast charge battery del pro inch battery fast charge del pro plus inch battery fast charge and graphene battery the same should have better stereo speaker for video recording and photo resolution when zoomed the three models had to be curved screens and equal the size of screens and the cup of soda of at least hz or greater in the models equal to the competition and thus be able to compete with the other highend cell phones of today think huawei kept this device in almost all the features
Huawei,P40 Pro,does face unlock make real difference in unlock speeds compared to ds on flagship ds faster than ds face unlock for example oneplus or oneplus pro with the pop up camera
Huawei,P40 Pro,something dont get with the pro if choose zoom of for example will get mp image resolution in return or will the device be able to somehow produce an image equivalent to mp with some magic algorithm if it is an mp indeed then what dont understand is why one shall pay more for the pro when the pro can produce mp image resolution indeed this mp sensors choice is unclear to me im sure someone here might have meaningful answer thanks in advance
Huawei,P40 Pro,am just in love with this phone want it badly
Huawei,P40 Pro,look at luminosity of the photos httpswwwgsmarenacompiccmpphpidtypeidphoneidphoneidphone
Huawei,P40 Pro,no official gms no go somemore huawei phone tends to devalue quite fast example is can snap pro for about usd in my country and its only year phone with great spec or mate pro with usdjust my opinion
Huawei,P40 Pro,love this phone because have infra red
Huawei,P40 Pro,if you said spying your phone account email social apps already able to access from their more regardless of tos nsa will spy on you anyway with or without your consent
Huawei,P40 Pro,front mirrored back no google services bootloader locked and unlockable more if you said spying your phone account email social apps already able to access from their company through device once you agree with terms and conditions so read all the tc st before saying huawei is the only company who can access your device read and think before you speak twice or more please dude
Huawei,P40 Pro,the silver frost color is magical but this phone will have dark future as the mate without more not really huawei banned will make them grow bigger through worldwide market slowly getting banned is cons for short term but will profit once the market start because huawei can grow in china why not world widejust they need time
Huawei,P40 Pro,big dispointment with big camera cutout nice phone
Huawei,P40 Pro,no no optical zoom no super slow motion fps nothing new from the previous mode more it has hz and secure face unlock thats the difference also all companies wants you to buy their top tier device so they water down alittle the others in the lineup the pro has optical zoom
Huawei,P40 Pro,samsung huawei cmon think it calls innovation simon personal communicator etc etc etc etc all smartphones all smartphones is copyinnovation of the first one called simon personal communicator so please drop all this copycat sh its the same with everything else cars etc dont know how old are cant be grown up because normal thinking people know these things
Huawei,P40 Pro,phone is great dont care about google apps but because of that big hole for front cameras will not buy it
Huawei,P40 Pro,they took the camera design from vivo hm did not vivo take it from the huawei lol
Huawei,P40 Pro,different between pro and pro gb vs gbboth expandable mp ryyb tele more exactly its like samsung is better deal than paying dollars more for ultra really hoped they would give qhd screen with hz display
Huawei,P40 Pro,who cares better and better night mode shots this issue became competition area that companies created as sales strategy as user think about that when you need or how often do you need night photos if it is really necessary use flash and believe very close results just good strategy make people stuck it and wanted to have better and better one
Huawei,P40 Pro,the ugliest cellphone ever no google service no audio jack small battery its ok
Huawei,P40 Pro,too expensive without google services id rather get samsung plus
Huawei,P40 Pro,between all the three variants must say that the pro is the best balance allround bet more wrong it has nano memory card twice as expensive as microsd card and super difficult to find big no to huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro,same problem as with same ryyb sensor replacing green pixel with yellow pixel yellowish pictures even in day timebad
Huawei,P40 Pro,what does ois in the end of camera features mean
Huawei,P40 Pro,all smartphones have been looking more or less the same for several years there are practically no differences hole here hole there big or bigger camera hump what role does this play the technique inside and its usability play role ergonomics is equally bad or equally good for everyone it depends on the point of view
Huawei,P40 Pro,yeah the master of copycat is there dual punch hole display edge screen of samsung an more all smartphones have been looking more or less the same for several years there are practically no differences
Huawei,P40 Pro,great hardware worst design
Huawei,P40 Pro,it looks like am stuck with pro no reason to buy this one not even the slightest upgrade from pro very dissapointing huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro,man just love the design of this phone and love the fact the size is not as huge yet the screen is huge have watched the presentation online and every time am positively shocked some way by huawei this has optical zoommany rivals have less and this is not even the highestend model which has optical zoomtake that super expensive ultra what really dont like about these devices are the dual front facing cameras mean it looks like some dead pixels even hated this on the this thing ruins the beautiful huge display at least to me know it has an extra sensor and infrared but still it does not look well and the biggest problem is no google serviceswho knows what will come this year overall want to say hats off to huawei at making this monster phone
Huawei,P40 Pro,selfie cameras ruin the phones esthetic completely so sad
Huawei,P40 Pro,with all due respect no hardware as good as it may be worth letting go of google services more its not they have it done by choice the lack of gms is hard but it is refreshening to see google play store and mobile services finally get worthy opponent with hms and huawei appgallery one should decide for oneself which to trust more though
Huawei,P40 Pro,people who comment here have no idea of the performance about the current huawei phones and more drop the friggin holes and notches already who would want an obstructed display
Huawei,P40 Pro,everything sound good except the pill shaped cutout in the front dont understand whats th more that would give the phone hands free command using real gesture control

Huawei,P40 Pro+,miss when huawei used to have android and google play services
Huawei,P40 Pro+,missed this phone so much switched back to it from my mate pro went from pro pro mate pro the made me come back to loving photography the way did during my pro days still using the it feels better and photowise its delicious
Huawei,P40 Pro+,interesting where did you buy your pro its not easy to find this phone is hard to find bought pro and after month found progave the to my sonstill after yrs feels and runs better then any other phone on the marketp pro and pro series was the top of the quality of the huaweiif there was no ban from usa imagine how would huawei look like todayi travel regulary to china due to bussines chinese people still cant believe use pro till nowonly lack of it no esim supportapart from that give me another phone that can came close to this model
Huawei,P40 Pro+,how about the battery and camera features what kind of question is that how are the cameras its huawei flagship phone the cameras are its strong point as for battery just like gsmarenas review shows its not too great nor very bad dependable enough
Huawei,P40 Pro+,hi have had the mate pro pro and currently have the pro and truly loved all of more hi which one is better is it the pro plus or the mate pro as the optical zoom digital zoom and together with the fps super slow motion is what am looking for to be specific and so which has better optical zoom
Huawei,P40 Pro+,pro pros much better handling and materials much stronger selfie camera in terms more hi have had the mate pro pro and currently have the pro and truly loved all of them however honestly think that the camera on the pro is superior to the mate pro but inferior to the pro no ois on main camera on mate pro which was very frustrating the camera on the pro felt as though the post processing between that and the pro was better on the pro just my thoughts
Huawei,P40 Pro+,does anyone know how does one check whether the pro plus is brand new or used one as more uhmi guess if you search for it new you will find it to buy new but if you look for it at second hand then you will find it usedi dont understand what you mean on how to check new or used you just check the price used of course will be cheaper and of course random person will usually sell it while new would be selled either an official store online or one in your city
Huawei,P40 Pro+,both are getting or already got harmony os does anyone know how does one check whether the pro plus is brand new or used one as im planning to buy one either today or in days to come please help is it possible to check even without buying it first like asking the imei no of the phone which is on the box is there web site which can in put imei to confirm or should just go buy the mate pro which seem highly likely that is is new
Huawei,P40 Pro+,hello am wondering if this phone is good purchase for euros thank you at second hand presume or new if it is new then it is pretty decent deal but if second hand then its bit overpriced and of course as long as you dont get bothered by not having google play servicesthen its great phone back in the day when it was released it had the best camera on smartphone
Huawei,P40 Pro+,can anyone pls kindly tell me whether huawei mate pro or the huawei pro plus can be more both are getting or already got harmony os
Huawei,P40 Pro+,is this google avalive nope
Huawei,P40 Pro+,can some pls tell me what if the battery needs to be replaced will it be hard as it is made of ceramic back will it affect its ip functions
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ok but did it come natively with the pro try and understand what he said he installed google services so how can you ask is it native when you know its not therefore your comment is moot
Huawei,P40 Pro+,its the second best phone in the world after mate pro plus no mater what anyone says about more agree and google is predator they still all your information they are the ones who spy be careful using google
Huawei,P40 Pro+,gms google mobile services is googles ecosystem of apps google play store maps gma more what are you talking about have installed all google services stop lying
Huawei,P40 Pro+,what is gms if you mean gsm yes it is gsm phone gms google mobile services is googles ecosystem of apps google play store maps gmail youtube huaweis phones dont have access to gms since their android license was pulled by google after the trump ban in the usa am just hoping biden can lift the ban and allow huawei back in the usa they have been releasing some really nice phones
Huawei,P40 Pro+,have you bought this phone without even knowing the details about it having no gms looking th more what is gms if you mean gsm yes it is gsm phone
Huawei,P40 Pro+,best front camera design why didnt apple do this
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the return of master copycat copying edge screen now dual punch hole display of and peo more are dump why thinking like that its not abt copying its ideal tell me among those companies who always discover there own thing without taking another company technology to improve theres
Huawei,P40 Pro+,hi please did anyone compare that zoom to the regular pro with when did by mysel more zoom is times more than and the subject is much closer and with free hand it is difficult to control the image stability so you need tripod or support the phone on stable subject it is the same with professional dslr camera so they carry tripod
Huawei,P40 Pro+,what you are saying here comes down to nothing mean no productivity you are just not used to starting from new when android came out no one knew which apps to use but we got to know throughout the years at the moment im using pro plus and have found alternatives to everything google had can even watch youtube with an app and this banking with no trust please dont spread fake news do you know who to trust if you trust google or whatsapp or facebook you are already tusting the wrong companies
Huawei,P40 Pro+,really not worth the trouble especially for people on the go productivity is dead also yo more fakenews
Huawei,P40 Pro+,got this pricey phone just for the hardware nd phone with google play is still manda more install chat partner from appgallery then it installs the google apps for you
Huawei,P40 Pro+,people on the comment section here say bad stuff of the phone of no google play you all can install the google play services so you can have google play on it and use it as full android phone but they will later release harmonyos
Huawei,P40 Pro+,next time snapdragon sd for global pls and with hybrid zoom or space zoom telescope or priscop zoom thanx
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the huawei pro battery will faster hot or not
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dont have any of those issues with huawei pro its just like all other phone more thanks for your advice
Huawei,P40 Pro+,awful experience you cannot access one single google service in normal way literally nothi more agree
Huawei,P40 Pro+,we will buy huawei phone again and again examples huawei and huawei mate with snapdragon and plus dual operating systems android and harmony mobilephone dual battery systems mah mah while it may be some time before we get weeks life out of our mobilephones development is progressing well weve collected all the best battery discoveries that could be with us soon from over the air charging to superfast second recharging hopefully youll be seeing this tech in your gadgets soon
Huawei,P40 Pro+,buy any huawei phone which is without google play services use it for day and you will more to zorangelev get what you are saying my friend
Huawei,P40 Pro+,hpowner oct own huawei for almost month with no google services dont feel any limitatio more and just when you enter your car you plug in your phone in android auto stereo and you get the message this phone does not support
Huawei,P40 Pro+,explain the major software limitations please buy any huawei phone which is without google play services use it for day and you will see the limitation you have to feel it on day to day usage that something is missing
Huawei,P40 Pro+,lack of google mobile services means some apps and games will never work no matter what this is false you can install gms if you follow guide on youtube and actually know what you are doing uwu
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ca samsung galaxy ca
Huawei,P40 Pro+,this means that huaweis likely goal to equip the series in spring and the mate series in autumn with the snapdragon and respectively if contrary to expectations cooperation should come about we can look forward to new and very powerful smartphones from huawei in the coming year that wouldnt be the first time that qualcomm chipsets are being used in huawei midrange smartphones we remember the series from and also the nova series
Huawei,P40 Pro+,iamjoshuabcxvii sep how many frequencies can this phone aggregate mean how many ca ca
Huawei,P40 Pro+,iamjoshuabcxvii sep the pro has two different lenses than the pro shorter medium range optical zoom more indeed but the magnification is borrowed from the vanilla one and guess they do the same things with with focal length and aperture adjustment to achieve wide focus area on magnification
Huawei,P40 Pro+,nah bro think dxo wouldnt or even if the do pro have the exact same specs as more the pro has two different lenses than the pro shorter medium range optical zoom that has faster aperture than the pros optical thats could be used for portraits the well known optical
Huawei,P40 Pro+,iamjoshuabcxvii aug pro series has very narrow fov compared to other ultrawide cameras of other flagshipsbu more mean like none of those sensor nor lenses are different except the opt zoom however indeed the opt zoom would boost the score on dxo scoring at zooming but the rest is all about the same fyi huaweis flagship nowadays doesnt have an ultrawide angle lense instead they have cine lense that replace the ultrawide one it also answer why those phone cannot take proper macro shot anymore
Huawei,P40 Pro+,huawei new harmoney operating system smartphone huawei pro price
Huawei,P40 Pro+,lol there seems to be misunderstanding here ridiculous mean compliment whe more ok
Huawei,P40 Pro+,you called the optical zoom as ridiculous have you ever played with normal camera zoom se more lol there seems to be misunderstanding here ridiculous mean compliment where while other smartphones only use periscopes to get or huawei could achive magnification with their tech also forgot to reply previous comment that said pro plus would give better result than pro
Huawei,P40 Pro+,come one huawei xiaomi mi ultra has taken your throne dollar lower price better came more bros dxomark only reviewed huawei pro not pro
Huawei,P40 Pro+,in my place its eur since launched huawei pro euro
Huawei,P40 Pro+,switched cell from samsung galaxy to huawei pro copied all the apps from the old phone to the new one with huawei phone clone all my apps are available through huawei appgallery or patel search including the gms its the best phone ever used
Huawei,P40 Pro+,only idiots made flagshipphone for euro and not stereo sund in lol ba more next time try harder
Huawei,P40 Pro+,youre true smartie the lowest this phone has recorded so far is more in my place its eur since launched
Huawei,P40 Pro+,if they just put gb ram would buy it today but they havent upgraded that part for several models if buy pro you arent losing much compared to this model
Huawei,P40 Pro+,super big and big flagship huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro+,literally this phone is my dream tried it the other day at our local store and the pictures are out of this world feels so nice when hold it
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the prices in germany are already down to like two weeks after release and still dro more we are now in the euro range brand new in europe prices are dropping radically as people are finding out sideloading isnt working as well as some are claiming or at atll
Huawei,P40 Pro+,its kirin chipset really cant compete with snapdragon will go for the more ofc but mind you that oppo has very bad customer service
Huawei,P40 Pro+,wow just wow optical isnt iffy thats the point of having huge optical zoom as in not looking that good right now
Huawei,P40 Pro+,you named two apps what about the wealth of apps one cant even sideload you know the more in case you havent noticed he mentioned those two as an example he said he is using the lite without gms and its fine
Huawei,P40 Pro+,in germany unfortunately as long this phone is the best out there there will be no ch more the prices in germany are already down to like two weeks after release and still dropping
Huawei,P40 Pro+,yea but can still install most of the apps like viber messenger watsapp it has google maps more you named two apps what about the wealth of apps one cant even sideload you know the ones where hundreds of millions use them
Huawei,P40 Pro+,yea it has just the regular spy apps name one and il believe
Huawei,P40 Pro+,many legitimate reviewers are reporting the sideloading no longer works it makes me wonder more ebay is for scammers never use ebay
Huawei,P40 Pro+,not an issue anymore since you still can side download google apps besides you dont need most more many legitimate reviewers are reporting the sideloading no longer works it makes me wonder who all these people are saying to buy the phones and sideload europes ebay portals are filled with brand new units where the users state sideloading failed
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dennisk jul eur in germany unfortunately as long this phone is the best out there there will be no chance of getting it cheaper
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ppro jun yes its not ancient black and white nokia those phones used to have fm radio and mm jac more your looking for nothing
Huawei,P40 Pro+,my dude the optical zoom is waaaaay better than the zoom in fact would believe more right now the optical is looking bit iffy
Huawei,P40 Pro+,urmomcom jun huawei didnt used hz and instead worked at hz refresh rate in order to make up for the more sister bought huawei ppro about months ago and also she was taught how install google too do nt know why there people saying otherwise so same thing should apply to this ppro plus before switching it she was using huawei yes it only yuan in china im planning get either ppro matepro so any advise for me bought several phones from china which none of them has google just use other phone for gms
Huawei,P40 Pro+,euro for no hzno google services how funny huawei didnt used hz and instead worked at hz refresh rate in order to make up for the battery and there really isnt that much of difference the size is marginally smaller explains the small battery this phone isnt for people who are used to the mate or honor the ultra is and obviously huawei phones cant use google because of senseless accusations so to make up for the price they add the best camera system in the mobile world ceramic back that reduces heating up actually making better performance an impressive display not the best though the ability to record fps on the selfie camera other phones can do this but those phones are similarly priced super fast wireless charging that doesnt destroy battery health as seen on the oppo wireless charging and pretty much great specs all around of course it isnt euro as of now you can get it for yuan or euro for the gb of storage option at vmall httpswwwvmallcomproducthtmlvalidatedtruethemenameredloginchannelreqclienttypelangzhcn so yeah think the price is justified
Huawei,P40 Pro+,google play work in this model no it doesnt btw is call play store for long time please update your knowledge
Huawei,P40 Pro+,iamjoshuabcxvii jun great the max brightness on manual is negligible but the auto mode is great for viewing unde more my dude the optical zoom is waaaaay better than the zoom in fact would believe the mp sensor is better than the mp sensor on ultra as it is bigger and can catch more details in lowlight and in brightlight
Huawei,P40 Pro+,huawei pro so good but huawei too much modeled on other cellphone models especially more it has similarities but isnt the same design did samsung put ceramic back
Huawei,P40 Pro+,great the max brightness on manual is negligible but the auto mode is great for viewing under direct sunlight one disadvantage of the pro gone for me now its just mono down firing speaker mediocre ultrawide viewing angle when compared to ultra iphones the dim optical zoom the optical finger print reader instead of ultrasonic but quite ok as it has very secure faceid lol hopefully they could update the optical to produce somewhat goodly lit photos as happpen to watch some reviews that in terms of brightness the is underexposing when compared to ultra where it maintained the overall exposure from to but still im still eyeing for this phone hopefully they could release this in the philippines already as ive been waiting for this for months already
Huawei,P40 Pro+,deleted post spend so much money and have to go through all the troubles not worth it
Huawei,P40 Pro+,its oled which is what samsung has amoled means active matrix oled it samsung version more has dynamic amoled display

Huawei,P40 Pro+,euro for no amoled displayno hzmah batteryno google support so funny its oled which is what samsung has amoled means active matrix oled it samsung version of oled
Huawei,P40 Pro+,no thanks
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ridiculous price next their silicone cases will start at each factor in the bom and bos as well as profit this phone is overpriced by at least sans the play store not until huawei has an app store that offers at least of the most common apps in the play store can they have the gall to charge premium lgs top end phones albeit the brand is not as popular offer hardware that is on par or better than huaweis while having an actual app store at several hundred dollars cheaper
Huawei,P40 Pro+,for eur this should be mah charging atleast larger screen than pro this phone needs no big battery huawei battery optimization is pure win bigger battery more weight and it is already too heavy phone that is close to weight of smaller tablet
Huawei,P40 Pro+,this is top of the range in the series it should be bigger in the range of to for more same thoughts
Huawei,P40 Pro+,eur and no google apps no thanks
Huawei,P40 Pro+,just use yvlr or newpipe and enjoy fully loaded youtube app with added features and adfree exp more the query is not googling for hot to run youtube in background but the use of something without the need to google or installing anything dont even watch anything on the phone bcoz the screen is too tiny prefer some pc monitor or if its tv then tv to fully enjoy the video
Huawei,P40 Pro+,without google services the youtube app will not work not yet at least but like said you more just use yvlr or newpipe and enjoy fully loaded youtube app with added features and adfree experience

Huawei,P40 Pro+,do huawei sell many of these in the uk without google services
Huawei,P40 Pro+,you dont even know how close to the truth you actually are the battery life on that samsung more nonono it is the best
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dennisk jun back to smsung with the crappiest video badly optimised mp camera trash zoom and trash more you dont even know how close to the truth you actually are the battery life on that samsung is terrible and camera is far cry from being optimized maybe in year maybe not
Huawei,P40 Pro+,no stereo speaker no google app just overfocus about camera and dont care great no one asked
Huawei,P40 Pro+,happy with pro gonna buy this to replace actually it is not hard to live without gms used to it for months not that hard to adjust depending on apps use
Huawei,P40 Pro+,perfect mobile without gms
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dxomark didnt test pro and score is for pro none version think score more nice comment sir
Huawei,P40 Pro+,as per dxo mark rating its camera is the best camera in phones world dxomark didnt test pro and score is for pro none version think score could be more than even
Huawei,P40 Pro+,no match to ip pro as per dxo mark rating its camera is the best camera in phones world

Huawei,P40 Pro+,rh apexpredator may bro go check on aliexpress mi pro cost two times the price of pro go check it out yourself xiaomi mi pro dual sim smartphone mobile phablet lte unlocked global rom brand new free postage
Huawei,P40 Pro+,price is reasnoable for the spec that phone has best camera on the market dont see the re more the hardware is not the best the optimization of the hardware is the best lot of the phones has same cpu and camera but huawei still takes best pictures the thing about privacy is related to shutter sound too and many more than that
Huawei,P40 Pro+,its price so high that general cant afford it plus high zoom is bad for privacy policy price is reasnoable for the spec that phone has best camera on the market dont see the reason why would high zoom have problem with privacy
Huawei,P40 Pro+,how much can this phone zoom optically while shooting at kp and kp respectively will more the maximum zoom while taking video will be courtesy of mrwhosetheboss however that zoom will be digital zoom past it will be the sharpest at and
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dennisk may if exynos outperforms then why are the series sitting quite below other phones know more the is selling not so good bcoz even with video recording mp camera it still cant beat huawei and then there is the price mean the series aint cheap but the cheaper xiaomi makes its way to the market that antutu score was talking about is from april besides should be hint since its quite new httpswwwantutucomenrankingrankhtm
Huawei,P40 Pro+,did you decided already am about to get the because my samsung makes one times bet more dude if you want to make videos xperia ii is go its pro camera in disguise
Huawei,P40 Pro+,according to antutu snapdragon has similar score to what performs but exynos more if exynos outperforms then why are the series sitting quite below other phones know youre looking at the outdated global antutu
Huawei,P40 Pro+,why would high zoom be bad for security reasons because with that optical zoom you can spy on anyone from your apartment saw some video on facebook did zoom from his apartment to spy on bikini lady on the pool nextdoor with pro with this new leave it the rest to your imagination lol
Huawei,P40 Pro+,yes the camera on pro has better optics and lenses every pro in the series had bet more it will surely be interesting to see how well the camera performs then my main concern and why am getting the regular pro for now while there is still the special offer is that the camera wont be much better than the main camera the main camera has big sensor and high resolution albeit quad bayer compared to the which basically only has going for it as rough estimate for detail resolution multiply magnification with the square root of sensor resolution in mp main camera sqrt pro sqrt times pro sqrt times pro sqrt times the camera will likely be extremely good and blow everything out the water but until you actually get to make use of it if you shoot in raw the camera will not get activated unless you pick which often might be too much magnification and not fit the whole scene if you dont shoot in raw you lose lots of detail to noise suppression and get unnatural sharpness you will be stuck with the would have loved to see higher resolution sensor on the camera
Huawei,P40 Pro+,is the camera the same as on the the specs appear to be the same but optics and senso more yes the camera on pro has better optics and lenses every pro in the series had better optics and lenses so far they upgrade the camera on pro series like they always do
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the actually has the best benchmark scores check the scores of the iphone according to antutu snapdragon has similar score to what performs but exynos has the highest score of all and that for almost half of the price apple sells their iphone pro is already outdated
Huawei,P40 Pro+,no it isnt designed to compete with flagships go look at benchmarks and speed tests more the actually has the best benchmark scores check the scores of the iphone
Huawei,P40 Pro+,read some raving reviews about this phone totally interested dicing between this and samsung did you decided already am about to get the because my samsung makes one times better photos than the am about pics videos and editing
Huawei,P40 Pro+,even looks nice phone but it is heavy brick sad phones these days get heavier and expensive more with heavy phones have better grip since can feel the weight lot better think the is enough for phones it shouldnt go any bigger but if the phone has great specs dont think should only consider display size when are considering buying it
Huawei,P40 Pro+,havent seen this in germany yet the pro however costs about eur read some raving reviews about this phone totally interested dicing between this and samsung
Huawei,P40 Pro+,would argue that google still has significant edge mainly because the new harmonyos will more ofc its for huawei only it was always superior to ios huawei mastered optimization to level that made them number despite the same hardware as other manufacturers and since they are the best you would want to keep on using their devices the only advantage google still has is the fact that all android users got used to the google play and some of the google apps which now huawei is providing not all of the apps but soon all apps you need will be available
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the us ban on china enabled breakthrough for huawei other will follow since you never know more would argue that google still has significant edge mainly because the new harmonyos will be incompatible with other android devices like in the case of ios you would need to immerse your self completely in huaweis ecosystem for you not to feel constrained by the differences in operating systems unless huawei can convince consumers to shift fully to their products it would be difficult to sell the new system what im looking forward to in the new os is how will it match up to ios in terms of optimization security and hardware utilization
Huawei,P40 Pro+,its not that hard to get used to new system yes people are accustomed to google services but more the us ban on china enabled breakthrough for huawei other will follow since you never know and google will become obsolete or just an alternative after all the best of the best cant use google and starts using their own huawei store ppl will follow
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ppro is not intended for most buyers it is designed and priced for that very exclusive gr more exactly its the same thing can say for ultra its also not designed for every buyer if ur big fan of camera should definitely go for pro
Huawei,P40 Pro+,problem with this phone mp mm mp mm anything between will rely on digital more of users will try out the zoomtelephoto in the first minutes of owning the phone also it will be the last time of the users did use the zoomtelephoto and then until they buy new phone they will keep on using the mp camera so arguing about some other cameras on this phone is literally pointless
Huawei,P40 Pro+,how is this any different from the normal pro pro has an even better camera with optical zoom it also has fast wireless charging while pro has
Huawei,P40 Pro+,very ugly screen same as samsung series very bad looking dead pixels
Huawei,P40 Pro+,in the context of smartphone discussion on this website or on any other website can you nam more ofc they name it httpswwwdxomarkcomhuaweipprocamerareview it literally says equivalent each time not single time have they missed that word let me recycle again you have conformed to the rest of us that you are utterly clueless
Huawei,P40 Pro+,all the focal lengths discussed in the context of smartphone is by default referring to th more in the context of smartphone discussion on this website or on any other website can you name one example where focal length discussed is not referring to its mm equivalent there is none all focal lengths discussed in the context of smartphone is by default referring to its mm equivalent you have conformed to the rest of us that you are utterly clueless
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the focal lengths discussed in the specification sheets of all the smartphones on this website more couldnt care less equivalent is equivalent focal length is focal length si units define defaults nothing else
Huawei,P40 Pro+,we are talking about the mm equivalent of mm all the focal lengths discussed in the more all the focal lengths discussed in the context of smartphone is by default referring to that of mm equivalent no its not without equivalent its the normal focal length there is no review out there about phones that does not mention equivalent or similar term bcoz the phone has normal focal length which as explained is the distance from lens to sensor and since im lazy will recycle part of your comment you do understand this simple and extremely basic fact dont you you certainly sound like someone who is completely clueless xd
Huawei,P40 Pro+,focal length is the distance from lens to sensor even with mirrors doubling it it can never more we are talking about the mm equivalent of mm all the focal lengths discussed in the context of smartphone is by default referring to that of mm equivalent you do understand this simple and extremely basic fact dont you you certainly sound like someone who is completely clueless
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ppro vs ppro apr major differences between ppro and ppro an additional dedicated telephoto camera wi more focal length is the distance from lens to sensor even with mirrors doubling it it can never be mm could be mm at best
Huawei,P40 Pro+,major differences between ppro and ppro an additional dedicated telephoto camera with focal length of mm with much brighter lens much better than that of the zoom this is high quality telephoto camera dedicated to portrait photography worlds first smartphone periscope optical zoom with continuously variable focal length from mm to mm special feelgood ceramic back with engraved microstructures created using an expensive and exclusive process borrowed from highend jewelry making processes different memory and storage options etc only limited number of units will be made
Huawei,P40 Pro+,all perfect but design not good at all beside who play games like pubg or free fire the position of camera is boring huawei maybe you should next time do something different you are better than that
Huawei,P40 Pro+,lol you dont know what youre talking abt sit down of course do now run along and shoot your jerky videos with this huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro+,all looks fine but my concern is its ceramic body aluminum body could dent little but ceramic could be easily breakable
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ive got was thinking of changing to the pro can anybody give me some advice yea go for it the new hms is easy to use can download all importat apps that usewhatsappmessenger viber the pitcures on pro are unreal they really did awesome job with the camera currently the best camera on the market sell that and will save some money when buy pro

Huawei,P40 Pro+,helo friend my mobile huawei not showing sim card manger farmet time but not show opti more could be hardware issue check with different sim card
Huawei,P40 Pro+,well the pro has nd telephoto camera with ois and optical zoom wich plays good more no pro has mp telephoto with more advantages imo such as ryyb instead of rggb and video recording with the zoom lens but the mp telephoto on the pro has the optical to brag as well as the second to cover more focal lengths better
Huawei,P40 Pro+,wtf like galaxy ultra but at better zoom camera
Huawei,P40 Pro+,impressive camera attractive design fantastic fast wireless charging personally would more helo friend my mobile huawei not showing sim card manger farmet time but not show option wht do any body help please reply me
Huawei,P40 Pro+,can see many people are blaming that why huaweis price is not cheap although it doesnt has more nice thinking and agree this whole google issue sholud not have to be the reason to forget that this is high class phone with modern and fascinating technology in all kinds and all that comes with the price that personally consider reasonable
Huawei,P40 Pro+,wait minute expected release on june really
Huawei,P40 Pro+,drevox apr people act like china and huawei sre the only ones spying on citizens how do you think apple more well look its all speculation mean cant do anything about the situation so mind as well get the phone wich want currently checking out pro and it looks rly sharp checked out the new appgallery they have and its simple to use it even have side app called moreapps wich can use for downloading google apps some people even say that reccomending apps helps them to get around faster
Huawei,P40 Pro+,people act like china and huawei sre the only ones spying on citizens how do you think apple and google know exactly which apps you like what sort of shoes clothes etcwhere you like to go out to eat thats just tiny bit of the info they gather on daily basis
Huawei,P40 Pro+,have google play no this phone has no google play but there are many ways to download and use google apps on this phone first you can transfer your apps from old phone to new one with phone clone and there is huawei appgallery that has many popular apps to download or more apps as well
Huawei,P40 Pro+,you need to know where to buy nice advice wouldnt want my phone come with gms and sever more you mean aside from us spying on all your calls and messages why would you care for china spying on you it just one more country than before xd compare to that malware is harmless
Huawei,P40 Pro+,you need to know where to buy and if you buy without you can install yourself cant inst more you need to know where to buy nice advice wouldnt want my phone come with gms and several malware preinstalled
Huawei,P40 Pro+,hey what is the difference between ir tof and normal tof tof camera is more precisely when scanning objects with infrared light regular tof camera does the same when scanning objects but in they look much better and detailed huawei always had that on their flagship phones and is one of the reasons why their cameras are one of the best in the world
Huawei,P40 Pro+,mate series does not ship with gms iirc source httpsconsumerhuaweicomaucampaign more you need to know where to buy and if you buy without you can install yourself cant install google on
Huawei,P40 Pro+,mate pro is not number any more it still does awesome videos but so does unless you more mate series does not ship with gms iirc source httpsconsumerhuaweicomaucampaignhuaweimateanswers
Huawei,P40 Pro+,mate series mate pro is not number any more it still does awesome videos but so does unless you refer to google play which mate has
Huawei,P40 Pro+,well huawei was the st chinese mobile company who made breaktrought on the market with more apple are made for people who like ios and care about the brand samsung are for android fans who whant higher specs and care about the brand chinese brands are for android fans who whant better price huawei is chinese brand who was supose to be cheap that isn don understand why people will pay that much for chinese with only gb ram huawei is chinese chinese are not know for quality they are know for quantity and cheaper prices
Huawei,P40 Pro+,huawei still is no it just lost some of the popularity among ppl who use google play store more mate series
Huawei,P40 Pro+,first triple ois mobile
Huawei,P40 Pro+,islahuddun apr asalam alaikum hello to my all concerns first of all appreciated to huawei cell phon more nice comment that says lot in little word
Huawei,P40 Pro+,hate module camera positioning design
Huawei,P40 Pro+,asalam alaikum hello to my all concerns first of all appreciated to huawei cell phone brand has made great concept and making great changes best phones in durablity efficiency and look vise one thing that said to huaweii pls ponder over you cross the limit of costs in cell phones success is whom you giving qualities at low cost every good things have cost to much in whole world ppls have no power of purchasing elite things pls think your own motive regards islah
Huawei,P40 Pro+,without doubt this mobile phone has the best camera it is flawless and perfect in all areas
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the face is exactly samsung splus the back panel more or less like samsung splus no new designs for huaweii
Huawei,P40 Pro+,have now huawei pro and this is my first huawei phone after quite long samsung series pro plus seems to be an good phone even without gms really hope huawei will consolidate hms apps suite soon and will finish gms dependecies apple even not have gms and are living
Huawei,P40 Pro+,interesting you own samsung and you come to huawei page and say that xiaomi has better feat more well huawei was the st chinese mobile company who made breaktrought on the market with their leica cameras that also opened market for other minor chinese mobile companys like xiaomi back then personly for me like taking pictures and huawei are the best in the game when comes to that
Huawei,P40 Pro+,if you are xiaomi fan then you dont have to talk nonsense how huawei kirin is worse more am not xiaomi fan use samsung but let say that would not care about brand and look at the specs don understand why would someone chose huawaei and not xiaomi they are both chinese so someone who buy chinese doesn care about brand chinese are not known for quality they are known for qunatity but at least xiaomi has better features than huawei
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the no gms phone maybe next part they will ban programming languages for them so that they will create their own written in chinese language
Huawei,P40 Pro+,who care about water amd dust proof you buy phone to throw it in water even if he is more xiaomi mi with that cpu eur mi note eur ppro with the cpu mediamarkt eur tradingshenzen eur is as cheap as eur with same cpu as pro and same main camera do sports and twice week jogging obviously sweat the phone will not have contact with water but sweatsteam what about rainy days cant even take it out or the water will kill it xiaomi that is why huawei will be still better regardless
Huawei,P40 Pro+,compare mi pro with the huawei pro not xiaomi mi note huawei has worse proc more if you are xiaomi fan then you dont have to talk nonsense how huawei kirin is worse and they wont sell single phone its childrens story and this is not eur phone and you are not competent person to criticize such strong brand but you can read and learn from an existing like ephotozine tech radar dxomark notebookchek digital trends etc
Huawei,P40 Pro+,hmm so xiaomi mi note that is not water proof nor dust proof see videos there is noth more who care about water amd dust proof you buy phone to throw it in water even if he is water proof do you really belive that phone throw offen in watter will have no problem xiaomi has snapdragon who is better and why do you need gb ram seriosly is samsung has gb gb ram is good for now for euro phone but when you pay that much you have other options is like you buy bb ram on desktop is ok for now but not future proof gb ram is for high end in computers for smartphones true there still people who has gb ram on desktop but they can only use media center with that
Huawei,P40 Pro+,its the same thing as pro they only added ceramic back frame downside massiv more not quite the pro has telephoto cameras and optical zoom wich is quite difference in terms of having good camera on phone
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dxomark conclusion we are used to seeing the top score in the dxomark camera ranking creep more the top spot never left the huwei house the last one was mate pro of course at mp the mi note did take better pictures but not videos and at night mate pro could not be beaten and before that ppro mean apple gained on pic quality especially the videos but it never had chance
Huawei,P40 Pro+,check the sony xperia ii inorder for you to know fam boy sonys alpha cameras put it on more thanks laughed hard seriously there is nothing to compare the is way above
Huawei,P40 Pro+,phone looks great been using huawei since mate pmate nova mate more well used mate pro and now im using lite the new appgallery system is not bad at all since can transfer apps via phone clone dont need to download the apps all over againi mean they are probably working on bringing the rest of the apps to the appgallery
Huawei,P40 Pro+,looking forward for pro premium edition packed with mah battery
Huawei,P40 Pro+,xpeia ii the one that has worse camera than it also has almost screen means scree more check the sony xperia ii inorder for you to know fam boy sonys alpha cameras put it on smartphone now that is true innovation of smartphone camera not this junk that trools people with the outcome of the photos if your programmer you kniw what is happening to the camera software you can make fun of the people around showing photo captured jnti your phone that is better than other phone
Huawei,P40 Pro+,is way to expensive for the features that it has gb ram euro on chinese phone iphones assembled in china worse specs samehigher price
Huawei,P40 Pro+,they should make an improved version and call it the pro ultra
Huawei,P40 Pro+,sad that they only use mp sensors for the optical zoom cameras have the pro and there more compare optical zoom ultra mp pro mp and high iso mp fixed zoom far away compare other brand just
Huawei,P40 Pro+,which xiaomi has better specs than ultra something like that does not exist yet huawei more did not say that xiaomi has better specs than samsung said that xiaomi has better specs than huawei lot better there are lot of xiaomi with gb ram and model don know what model has video and is cheaper than huawei so what is the point of buying this if you whant brand you choose samsung if you whant android or apple if you like ios if you don care about brand and whant smaller price and higher specs you can go to xiaomi is just like huawei with better specs and cheaper price
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ultra has versions with gb and with gb ram fps just like most movies xiaomi more which xiaomi has better specs than ultra something like that does not exist yet huawei has similar pricing as samsung except is still lot cheaper than iphones and takes best pictures as for medium specs if huawei has medium specs then the phone you are using has worse specs xd and yea there is that sultra it has in deed gb ram
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ultra has gb ram where only handful of ppl will ever make use of that much barely se more ultra has versions with gb and with gb ram fps just like most movies xiaomi has gb ram and better specs and is lot chepear why is so expensive is still chinese brand just like xiaomi oppo or whatever huawei is not apple to have his own os and charge more money for less features huawei is just another chinese brand with medium specs and higher price
Huawei,P40 Pro+,exactly without making the picture look blurry and can focus better on what are zooming in to better result than samsungs rushing to he the first zoom phone
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dennisk apr yeah to keep it consistent zooming between and think exactly without making the picture look blurry and can focus better on what are zooming in to
Huawei,P40 Pro+,have telephoto cameras and optical zoom on pro yeah to keep it consistent zooming between and think
Huawei,P40 Pro+,think answered well you just didnt get it as huawei is going for optical zoom it more its possible wait for the next years telephoto cameras on smartphones big sensors with minimum optical and hybrid optical zoom
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dennisk apr also wondering the same which gives the pro model the ability to do video with the tephoto more and that footage from that small telephoto sensor on pro will be garbage compared to from the ultra which uses last years flagship sensor imx
Huawei,P40 Pro+,sony xperia ii will kill this one except on zoom but this phone has long range but less pix more xpeia ii the one that has worse camera than it also has almost screen means screen on time will be extremely bad as more pixels need more power the only thing sony can do is speakers that phone will have nice sound and that is all so for good battery life nice pics you stay with huawei for good sound sony
Huawei,P40 Pro+,its an awesome gadget am real huawei fan and wont mind it even without google apps but th more how about pro then think it has good price with all specs he comes with it costs little bit more than pro when it came out
Huawei,P40 Pro+,only gb ram chinese brand that cost more than no thanks
Huawei,P40 Pro+,best phone in the worldapple fans would like this to be an iphone
Huawei,P40 Pro+,my st huawei hand phone was nd was mate screen big enough for me but only gb ram later go for pro good enough but screen little bit small for me was thinking to change new one mate pro but not suit my test because of curve screen so waiting for pro or pro but very disappointed me is why the flagship phone are mostly having curve screen even samsung oppo also having the same pattern does it look elegant fashionable or glamour again at this moment flagship phone is going to gb ram and mah battery capacity pro only come with gb ram and mah think this is failure for huawei sorry am going for xiaomi black shark pro this time
Huawei,P40 Pro+,dont you think the price is bit high as huawei is also famous for its affordable costing bit high its too expensive just like ultra and compared this two models iphone pro max gb is just overpriced
Huawei,P40 Pro+,don understand why is so expensive first of all the specs are not in the same league as more actually the pro is faster than the ultra httpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsscreenshotpng
Huawei,P40 Pro+,camera setup is of course very very good but the sensor is not the best than pureview
Huawei,P40 Pro+,to pricey for phone without gms will but this one if the price is
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the could have kept the mp from the pro it does not make sense to reduce resolutio more also wondering the same which gives the pro model the ability to do video with the tephoto but not the pro hmm
Huawei,P40 Pro+,can the new huawei perform well without google before buying do you know what happened with nokia phones with lumia lineup at that time no doubt nokia phones where really good in quality design and camera still they were lost due to software os now think same about these huawei phones
Huawei,P40 Pro+,not sure it answers my question but why skip the mp they use on the pro in this case so more think answered well you just didnt get it as huawei is going for optical zoom it might not be possible with bigger sensor
Huawei,P40 Pro+,how about the premium edition which packed of mah battery
Huawei,P40 Pro+,smaller sensors are easier to work with as they are going for numbersx zoom they cant re more not sure it answers my question but why skip the mp they use on the pro in this case sounds unfair for me to pay more to get less resolution at same zoom level seems even non sense unless there is trick to get mp by combining the and into something that could produce mp image
Huawei,P40 Pro+,google play no yes no gms but there is hms huawei mobile service
Huawei,P40 Pro+,wow it is more like husamweisung sp change the location of camera hole you got it more not funny
Huawei,P40 Pro+,had mate pro and it has the same size battery it could last litteraly whole day even if more but there are rumours about use more power than so need bigger battery
Huawei,P40 Pro+,optical zoom comparison mp pro mp and iso high mp fixed optical is
Huawei,P40 Pro+,mah battery too small for had mate pro and it has the same size battery it could last litteraly whole day even if you are using it all day didnt use it every time of the day and it could last day and half
Huawei,P40 Pro+,so this mobile will have tof camera good news but dont remember when read this the iphone will be the only mobile will have this camera
Huawei,P40 Pro+,the camera is superb
Huawei,P40 Pro+,no but you have other options huawei has appgallery as it source of aplications its huawei more yes you can use google app why your lying that he cannot have mate pro and im using all google app including google pay store
Huawei,P40 Pro+,why so manny cameras
Huawei,P40 Pro+,for someone who is an amateur photographer this phone offers absolutely everything you need for photo on the go camera of course in pro mode option battery and fast charging
Huawei,P40 Pro+,awesome camera specification fps
Huawei,P40 Pro+,amazing but battery is small
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ram gb to less
Huawei,P40 Pro+,this the worst looking front in smartphone to date can tolerate the iphone and new iphone compared to this
Huawei,P40 Pro+,we can use both gms and hms in device after installing google services
Huawei,P40 Pro+,remembered that revatlas video the comments on that video completely contradict what you sa more what the comments arent my own eyes can clearly see the gets destroyed with my own eyes and dont need comments to tell me otherwise those are obviously just butthurt owners who dont want buyers remorse
Huawei,P40 Pro+,something more than iphone pro max
Huawei,P40 Pro+,in fact there is high chance its faked because in comparison between the lumia and more remembered that revatlas video the comments on that video completely contradict what you said here complete night and day difference
Huawei,P40 Pro+,httpsyoutubekwvccasg poor not chance in fact there is high chance its faked because in comparison between the lumia and the pixel xl the lumia also has mp sensor but was released year later and has been shown to produce better results the gets absolutely destroyed the comparison was made by revatlas on youtube
Huawei,P40 Pro+,just because its the largest sensor doesnt mean its the best go ahead and compare that sen more httpsyoutubekwvccasg poor not chance
Huawei,P40 Pro+,thank to exnokia employees they make the camera of huawei good nokia innovation is the king more just because its the largest sensor doesnt mean its the best go ahead and compare that sensor to any sensor on any phone this year and just see how poor it is
Huawei,P40 Pro+,agree mar but if makers dont based on androidu think ios is available not to mention windows phon more yet hope the most powerful mobile processor kirin gb ram and more apps in app gallery
Huawei,P40 Pro+,wait why are there two telephoto lenses it is simple the zoom modules on smartphones are fixed this means that the camera which is capable for optical zoom can not create images that are eg magnified but the difference between and is too big to be covered with digital zoom so they have added camera as well as result it should have much better pictures at eg or zoom as other smartphones in the market the should is important because the final image quality is not just depending on the lens but also the pixel size the resolution and the filters and algorithms applied to it so we will see
Huawei,P40 Pro+,no aptx support in such high end phone sorry double tap
Huawei,P40 Pro+,no you cant but heard huawei developing their market its named appgallery and its true that cant download apps such as messenger whatsapp but those things can transfer with phone clone and they work just fine without any errors they are still working to bring more apps to download
Huawei,P40 Pro+,all major companys following samsung like punch hole display rectangular camers they copied dual camera from huawei but ok
Huawei,P40 Pro+,with all its news not so spectacular compared to the pro the new pro plus disappoin more but if makers dont based on androidu think ios is available not to mention windows phone already oofand its not like out of the box anyone can create platform from nothing with just flick hms is there but most core apps for worksocial is still there but play wise not much especially if those who love to spend on games will find it tedious as gpay is not available specs wise it can be better but seems might have fall short against the early releasers like samsung or xiaomi hope mate might pull out something more attractive
Huawei,P40 Pro+,ugly screen
Huawei,P40 Pro+,worst displsyscreen implementation the corners look ill fitted as if the screen is for an entirely diferent device bad bad indeed for an expensive device of course all the chinaccp loversfanboys will say it is an innovation gorgeous just beautiful modern etc but the fact is no other device has this obnoxious ill fitted screen not even the cheapest one

Huawei,P40 Pro+,ugliest punch hole ive ever seen have no clue why manufacturers havent all switched to po more pop up cameras need separate mother boards heat dissipation isnt uniform in this case

Huawei,P40,the size of this phone is ideal there really isnt anything stopping huawei from adding and ir blaster mah battery and ip to make this phone perfect given the speed of wireless charging dont really care for it
Huawei,P40,hello can any of this phone owner give me honest review im planning to switch from my mate more ive just changed from mate pro and dont recommend the phone the camera is better on the it does fps the speed slowmo is available at not limited to or lower the battery is smaller and doesnt fast charge as fast but my year old mate pro was getting bit worn battery wise so the newer phone feels like it lasts bit longer but the main issue and reason dont recommend it is the lack of google mobile services without access to all the apps on the play store including ones ive paid for it isnt as useful cant use my banking app authenticator plus app intervalometer app for taking timelapse of the stars in the light painting star trail mode so many things are not available to me anymore the gspace app might be all you need but it runs the apps in virtual machine and doesnt support google apps paid domain account like use probably fine for basic gmail account ive tried few attempts at getting google play gmail and the like installed natively but at the moment the phone isnt supported by twrp and doesnt look easy so in conclusion great camera and phone but without google services wouldnt recommend it
Huawei,P40,shehab arahman apr we are now on huawei is still not support stereo speaker for all devices we are in this is in early
Huawei,P40,eastern models get first harmony rollout see phonemore several phone variants

Huawei,P40,hi or pro battery performance of course
Huawei,P40,the has great battery ive been using it for year im pleased okthank you
Huawei,P40,samsung phones are disgusting in the camera department theyre only useful if you will more the is very good in photos and filming look at youtbe
Huawei,P40,mine is ananx and yes it doesnt have ois all vanilla does not have ois on its main cam more thanks man
Huawei,P40,yes which model number or better does the model nmbr ananx has ois mine is ananx and yes it doesnt have ois all vanilla does not have ois on its main cam seems like some of the website think it has
Huawei,P40,mean model number or what yes which model number or better does the model nmbr ananx has ois
Huawei,P40,wht is the version nmbr of vanilla mean model number or what
Huawei,P40,vanilla does not have ois same as mate pro after got emui update quality are the more wht is the version nmbr of vanilla
Huawei,P40,on huawei site it says the mp is just with no ois but here it says the mp with ois more vanilla does not have ois same as mate pro after got emui update quality are the same as mate pro main cam as they share the same hardware isp as for pro its hard to say no as well better telephoto has gms
Huawei,P40,well hawe pro looking at spec evwrytging the same expect no stereo speakers lotlle more what do mean its the same pro updated lot on the core aspect especially in performance camera should compare it with vanilla not the pro
Huawei,P40,bad news emui bug no google services wouldnt mind about it good news bette more its no bug dude huawei and google broke up it was pretty bad fight they are never ever ever getting back together
Huawei,P40,where did you get the deal its around here and waiting for price to go down it seems to be the regular price here in serbia
Huawei,P40,not much of difference compare to spec except it has now it has the tof sensor for secure face unlock and the cameras are better the design is also lot nicer imo
Huawei,P40,warning to users do not update to emui if care about camera quality somehow the more seems like the only decrease quality that im aware of is when using ff video in indoorlow light its like worse lol its not affecting me much as im using it mainly more into photography rear cams correction for my post
Huawei,P40,the battery capacity seems bad for me havnt owned this brand before try checking comparison on youtube the capacity should be enough for most people its like similar to how iphone manages to do well with small battery
Huawei,P40,you can enable those on screen navigational keys in the settings samsung phones are disgusting in the camera department theyre only useful if you will use gcam other than that samsungs software is despicable slow laggy etc ive been using samsung phones since the and all the way to im returning the and searching what phone to buy next all because of the bad camera quality that makes it worse than my and screen burn in at the bottom
Huawei,P40,its scary feeling knowing that bank app may or may not work last time my bank app locked out for some reason had real difficult time fixing it and dont want to risk so guess id pass this device or wait for while
Huawei,P40,just get myself brand new for main camera is mindblowing telephoto usable up to zoom front camera good quality got play store using dualspace method just under minutes work still playing around will give feedback after few weeks
Huawei,P40,can anyone chare what sot can you achieve wanna buy this phone brand new like everything but ima but worried ab battery life
Huawei,P40,ive been totally let down by the phone for this price tag was expecting much more fro more you can enable those on screen navigational keys in the settings
Huawei,P40,hi guys need help here should get this phone compare to samsung se need opinions more is great but display issue
Huawei,P40,gosh was about to buy this even though would not been able to run my bank app on it but now see there is no mm jack so it is an nogo now
Huawei,P40,cant setup my versa smart watch huawei admits its not compatible shitty phone
Huawei,P40,tips for stable file transfer videos only via otg update your software pc transfer via cable is again not working
Huawei,P40,just get gb sd card connect it to pc and transfer your precious gb movies on it much fa more gb internal is enough sofgwade update improves the video file transfer but still unstable to audio files use xender to wirelessly transfer audio files but at slow rate but it works
Huawei,P40,is it googe play service available no
Huawei,P40,huawei with snapdragon chipset huawei mate with chipset
Huawei,P40,already sideloaded gms twice and it always works this phone is the best price for specs in more agree for that price get even more than expected the phone has awesome specss especially the camera wich is the most important part if ask me
Huawei,P40,bro it dosent matter the sensor size and quality that much the iphone has only mp camera more iphone like pixel is using software to enhance the photo they used to be the best in camera department but today that is not the case now they are average there are many brands that outperform apple in photography at least and they are much cheaper
Huawei,P40,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvftizfehwlw followed this method and successfully install more dont need gms and google play now huawei comes with pedal search apps that can install all the apps you want to
Huawei,P40,have any of you here were able to successfully use gsm on this phone httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvftizfehwlw followed this method and successfully installed gms gpay wont work but you can installa lots of app from playstore
Huawei,P40,most people and tech youtuber said that the higher pro and pro has great camera compared all the variants camera using gsmarenas photo comparison tool and got to admit something here ill take vanilla over the pro and pro all day even though can see some hints of oversharpening in the its way way more forgiving than in the pro and pro the pro and pros photo is complete mess do think the inclusion of tof sensor somehow ruins the pro and pros overall photo quality
Huawei,P40,not good phone no gms battery too small for the year some application not supporte more noted
Huawei,P40,hello all am unsure about this phone if instal aps from moreaps will have updates for more yes ofcours ur updates will come thru apkpure the rd party app where download stuff moreapps is app that shows how to download the app want and it gives the linkmost of them are thru apkpure
Huawei,P40,to owners have you found reliable way to use play store on it many apps arent availa more apkpure
Huawei,P40,for overall and iphone for camera this phone is camera based in what world is the iphone camera better has higher resolution the uses one of the best if not the best camera sensors in the smartphone industry with slomo and same video resolution and fps the camera is waaaaaay betternot to mention zoom this is also cheaper the chip is also better than the iphone chip so this phone absolutely wins in all aspects
Huawei,P40,for phone you can buy for dollars this is one of the best smartphones out there the key point of this phone is its camera so if you are one of those camera users with limited budget you need this even if youre not the chip is flagship grade and battery should last you
Huawei,P40,definitely its better in overall specs and its cheaper for the money pay get lot more its nobrainer go for the and if you can spare some more money go for the pro its worth it
Huawei,P40,need help cant decide between and am concerned about processor is it old for more my sister bought huawei ppro abt months ago but also she was taught how to install google too before switching it she was using huawei
Huawei,P40,suggest has no google mobile service its not about not having google playstor more installed the apps from hms and they all worked well without gms for all the app need
Huawei,P40,vs iphone which is better definitely its better in overall specs and its cheaper for the money pay get lot more with so if wanna buy new phone go for
Huawei,P40,noticed that internet automatically turns off when am on call eventhough call is on sim more as per the mobile technology if you are using sim at time and you cannot use call on sim as well as internet on another sim both at one sim will do
Huawei,P40,nothing new and innovative the same screen resolution same camera there is no support more it looks like you are buying phones for specs and gimmicks not for real usage
Huawei,P40,hi do you think guys is way better than from camera perspective speaking ccamera performance is very important to me and from specifications im not sure if worths the extra money what else recommends it over thanks
Huawei,P40,huawei makes phenomenal phones each year this phone is simply excellent lack of google more well said
Huawei,P40,think its alright the phone itself is worth and can see that those headphones are wo more nzd btw which translates to eur
Huawei,P40,in new zealand the huawei is being offered for with bose noise cancelling headphone more think its alright the phone itself is worth and can see that those headphones are worth around so if need headphones go for it will even save
Huawei,P40,mate is better than pbigger batterybigger screenwireless charging would rather buy the pro because mate and mate pro are better that the and pro the only different is just the camera thats all
Huawei,P40,the phone is ok but peopledo you really keep promoting and buying chinese products after more could you specify what do you mean with after all that happened are you talking about the whole spy thing fiasco or are you implying something else
Huawei,P40,hey there first of all do not own any of these phones personally would go with the more helped alot thanks was also rooting for subconsciously
Huawei,P40,need help and suggestion should buy pro or love camera thank you both phones are great but its slightly better to go with model it has new kirin processor that is phenomenal for all tasks
Huawei,P40,please help me decide have an option for buying for pro for and fo more hey there first of all do not own any of these phones personally would go with the the camera is insanely good and while the pro already has great camera the ps is even better it also includes video recording fps ps kirin doesnt support fps video recording is just overpriced in my opinion its not better than the at all in fact the camera is worse and the battery life is terrible from what ive read the ps battery life is pretty good according to gsmarena testing the does have higher refresh rate but you didnt mention it as your priority so im guessing you dont care about that would completely eliminate the from consideration and choose between the huawei pro and imo the is worth the extra hope helped bit
Huawei,P40,are my eyes deceiving me phone thats smaller than in oh my god finally phone smaller than bricks
Huawei,P40,expect aggressive app management well the app managment wont be any problem at all have an app called appgallery wich can download regular apps and have rd party app called apkpure on apkpure can download google apps and get updates for them can also use the app moreapps wich will guide to download the app want
Huawei,P40,xiaomi mi se is ok but it is out of competition with the huawei as it has big diffe more and has with both rear and front camera optical compared to optical hybrid compared to hybrid and digital and again kirin is quite powerful chip
Huawei,P40,except pro and pro that come with hdr hz display the huawei is th more you can get almost the same specs on the xiaomi mi se for of the price is the worth the extra
Huawei,P40,device that has fantastic camera that does professional photography in all conditions especially when we are in nighttime environment one of the best mobile phones on the marke
Huawei,P40,like it
Huawei,P40,its seems like its to me
Huawei,P40,when will be the battery rating out
Huawei,P40,yo audiophile please ignore the stooges samsungapplehuawei and buy lg not only they ha more lack of gms is not nearly problem of this device most of your data and apps can be easily transferred by phone clone app from your old phone to new one so your whatsapp facebook viber and many more apps can be fully functional on also there is huawei appgallery where you can find all kind of popular apps to download in second if you like this phone you should have no doubts about it
Huawei,P40,no ip no deal well besides that is resistent to splash see that most of the people keep their phone in masks to protect them even those who have ip doesnt matter as long as you watch out for your phone dont need any ip certificate
Huawei,P40,huawei couldve at least kept the jack if not put an ir blaster can always use the type to aux adapter and ur problems are solved the other thing is can use bluethoot headphones was using adapter on mate pro since it didnt have jack and it worked perectly fine
Huawei,P40,again the lack of notification led is very disappointing after pro thought maybe huawei will recognize the importance of subtle led light for the business world and reintroduce it with pro but no therefore am sticking with my pro which has very discrete led the pro led does not shout out but very functional with color code it shows if my batteries are charged if have gmail or whatsapp message just by short glance to my phone without touching it and without any battery drain too bad that most phones are now coming without notification led
Huawei,P40,pls help me should buy pro for or for tips totally hate curv more absolutely if you have problems with the curved screen can buy case for ur phone to make ur grip better like you said camera is awesome and if its the most important thing for you dont see the reason not to buy it price is also good for the phone with that specs
Huawei,P40,why not add selfie cameras all over the screen
Huawei,P40,so pretty bad they removed the headphone jack it was the main feature of the non pro serie more its not that big of deal can use type to aux adapter and solve everything out can also try to use bluetooth headphones but if prefer jack then can use the adapter
Huawei,P40,yes it does have infrared face recognition no mean ir plaster it is written infrared port
Huawei,P40,is it really has infrared yes it does have infrared face recognition
Huawei,P40,theres something bad that the display of is produced by boe so the subpixel array is bad and the ppi is lower than the screen that produced by samsung or lg
Huawei,P40,still charge its not is brand new charger that the spec is va its va before but dont think theres some substantive improvement
Huawei,P40,they are not sony or htc to give out stereo speakers for flagship so dont expect long live htc and soon sony at least sony brought the headphone jack back
Huawei,P40,no stereo sound its flagship they are not sony or htc to give out stereo speakers for flagship so dont expect
Huawei,P40,disappointing and absolutely pointless device telephoto and ultrawide cameras are same as in more price idea
Huawei,P40,ppl too poor to afford spotify use modded spotify apk from any website
Huawei,P40,who tf is listening radio on their phones ppl too poor to afford spotify
Huawei,P40,so no mm jack still too big for proper compact no fm radio and all for tempting price more who tf is listening radio on their phones
Huawei,P40,with gms it would be best flagship at reasonable price flat screen telephoto main rear mp with biggest sensor usb for desktop mode mi are much worse unfortunately without gms its not worth even half that price
Huawei,P40,man its literally the same phone as the except for the cameras that dont expect to be lot better than they are already would still go for the saving more money practically the same phone plus google services have it now and im extremely happy with it great pictures great battery life good screen what else could you ask for
Huawei,P40,think between this device and the rest of the series huawei really have pushed for huge improvements all of this today with the announcement of the new uk store plus new products really shows how hardworking huawei are with setting the barr people forget that gms devices are battery draining so some of the negative comments here youre forgetting that hms helps regulate battery consumption vs gms devices fact soon as this lands ill be getting the pro
Huawei,P40,nm is almost the same size as microsd what is point to use it couldnt use the old one
Huawei,P40,whats happening with battery
Huawei,P40,one thing like most size is my favorite
Huawei,P40,yes its smaller that inches but it will be more comfortable to hold and for flagship more im all for smaller displays is already too big seems perfect
Huawei,P40,even is too much for the hz diplay
Huawei,P40,headphone jack
Huawei,P40,if the us and china would finally settle down with their trade war so that sprint could carry this then id probably jump on it its decently compact has promising cameras and battery has almost no bezels and more first fan by the way
Huawei,P50 Pocket,pocket does have wireless its located in the bottom part of the phone probably it more cannot undo my comment but after several testing and studying of teardown lack of antennna for wireless charging have no idea how my phone could show it was charging on the wireless pad my apologies chilli
Huawei,P50 Pocket,overpriced and useless without google play you can download all the needed gms apps through gspace pretty simple to get all the apps you need
Huawei,P50 Pocket,definitely agree true as long as everything works we can say screw
Huawei,P50 Pocket,netflix is already available on petal search just tried it on my honor lite
Huawei,P50 Pocket,unlike flip with soft politically correct colors this one looks better but it hasnt got the wireless charging and bootloader cant unlock
Huawei,P50 Pocket,just to be clear gsma obviously got flawed unit since mrmobile easily got one day of battery out of this phone dont take the battery rating in consideration
Huawei,P50 Pocket,which is huaweis home country and consists of huawei fans which doesnt use google more google and his preinstaled appsi want only devices that have nothing to do with google and microsoft
Huawei,P50 Pocket,like huawei pocket
Huawei,P50 Pocket,certainly one of the wackiest phones by huawei
Huawei,P50 Pocket,thinking huawei is one of the very best amongst all thanks huawei how
Huawei,P50 Pocket,who needs gms everything works definitely agree
Huawei,P50 Pocket,no one wants fold able phones that are as thick as two phones give me rollable or slidable more comrade well done
Huawei,P50 Pocket,it ismofficialy sold out of china now which is huaweis home country and consists of huawei fans which doesnt use google services so your point
Huawei,P50 Pocket,personally dont like the design at all but im still glad there are more foldables coming to the market to keep competetive environment
Huawei,P50 Pocket,while that mp fluorescence photo mode does look like neat party trick id rather have zoom or zoom telephoto camera instead to this day theres no telephoto camera on foldable flip smartphone and having telephoto camera can give great flexibility
Huawei,P50 Pocket,you are more than likely going to find all your essential applications in the app gallery ban more depends which ones most of the ones know are not there anyhow no excuse for them in my opinion google should be fair here because if all other chinese brands can provide gapps but hauwei can not that is just beyond ridiculous so considering it is not huawei their decision at least provide the option to unlock the bootloader
Huawei,P50 Pocket,only interested in the battery and im surprised to see the difference has little impact more the known problem for battery here is that android os allows some apps to run on background even without any initiation at the end battery would suffer
Huawei,P50 Pocket,ive could live with that since my mobile operator wont be offering in my area more you are more than likely going to find all your essential applications in the app gallery banking apps included
Huawei,P50 Pocket,significantly more expensive than zflip doesnt offer google services why did more because they made fans and they will buy huaweihonor no matter price when someone ask me for advice to buy huawei say no you use google not worth your money then they buy it and ask me to setup google for them ask for euros or gtfo told you
Huawei,P50 Pocket,they made the same stupid mistake samsung did this phone would have be much better on batt more huawei does not have permission to buy chips from qualcomm
Huawei,P50 Pocket,weak battery no space for cooling hence throttling to of its performance which very significant should have use more mid range processor so this can be perfected
Huawei,P50 Pocket,noticed huaweis phones have poor battery recently the pocket and pro only last and respectively the optimization of harmony os is terrible nowadays most phones go beyond
Huawei,P50 Pocket,my flip has been relegated to multimedia player and pocketable gamecube and dreamcast if my razr is charging the flex mode is awesome to watch content on it but the seamless way from watching videos on the big screen to the cover display or viceversa or using gmaps just isnt there even with the samsprung widget launcher feel razr does cover display the best for foldable flip phone then razr and then flip ive actually turned off any security to use samsprung with less hassle using bixby to wake it still feels more buggy and need an internet connection to use it with razr no need samsung really blew it for their both foldables with the outer displays motorola nailed it by its nd generation this pocket still feels too st gen with the useless circular outer display only slightly more useful than the st and nd flip it gets for that but every other area is an or above including larger battery than the razr and flip and expandable storage for my taste motorola razr samsung galaxy flip motorola razr huawei pocket tcl flex samsung galaxy flip samsung galaxy flip just cant stand the design of the first two flips and its useless cover display why listed it at the bottom even below the poorly reviewed razr which technically came out in early but we call it razr nobody is doing the cover display right except motorola
Huawei,P50 Pocket,stopped reading when saw batterys ratings same big fail think another comment is correct this is phone for wealthy women who want the looks and high end style but basically only use it for sms and calls
Huawei,P50 Pocket,anyone who want to spend euros for phone is someone who uses their phone lot and whats top specs lack of is just about tolerable not to have but such poor battery life makes it total no to me
Huawei,P50 Pocket,any phone that cost above samsung xiaomi apple is hard sell what is solid reason to buy more thats the point you can use the cover display to take selfies
Huawei,P50 Pocket,good to have more options with the foldable clamshells this flip phone just doesnt cater to my needs razr is really the only foldable flip phone to do the cover display right ive been trying to get the razr to own both modern razrs and even that ones cover display lacked the functionality of its successor trust me when say use both razr and flip thoroughly every day have praised the flip lot on here only recently have preferred razr slightly more while it lacks in horsepower it makes up for in price higher storage and cover display functionality its the only modern flip phone that makes the most sense in design
Huawei,P50 Pocket,definitely pretty solid for their first clamshell obviously theres much room for improvement but that applies to all the other foldables too new technology always takes time to mature up
Huawei,P50 Pocket,the battery life could be better maybe something to work on for next gen device very much more yes huawei needs kirin badly qualcomm sucks
Huawei,P50 Pocket,dis is for rich women only
Huawei,P50 Pocket,nothing is good about this except for display if this have the same price as iphone pro max ill go for the iphone without thinking twice this definitely for huawei hardcore fan or someone who want an alternative to galaxy flip
Huawei,P50 Pocket,thats making the pocket really tough sell just saw its almost on amazon here haha for phone
Huawei,P50 Pocket,do you recommend this phone in honestly there are better offers in with the price of this device can get much better flip phone second hand if are lucky can even find galaxy flip or could just go for flip which could still support recent software and could properly be good secondary phone overall only go for this if want more diverse camera and do not care about software and just want phone that does the flipy flipy
Huawei,P50 Pocket,why must be huawei actually its okay if you dont sell in america
Huawei,P50 Pocket,my wife loved it and bought pieces both have broken screen in the midle from normal usage more that is really sad to hear huawei is also known for their worse service centers btw
Huawei,P50 Pocket,its not comparable both form factors and specs are not the same is it more expensive
Huawei,P50 Pocket,miss huaweii hope in future huawei and google can get alongi need to buy huawei phone hi you can use google apps in gspacecan find in appgallery
Huawei,P50 Pocket,the gapless hinge system is promising on the flip since theres gap and the display more but not into the hinges there is brush system first introduced on samsung flip
Huawei,P50 Pocket,no loud speaker trash there is loudspeaker are you blind
Huawei,P50 Pocket,does really matters oh yes it does though we might not use now in future it makes huge change
Huawei,P50 Pocket,no big deal then its very big deal
Huawei,P50 Pocket,insted of getting foldables you should get like realme gt neo cuz they offer better perfor more its not comparable both form factors and specs are not the same
Huawei,P50 Pocket,from east to west huawei is the best of course the best brand with no google play services
Huawei,P50 Pocket,very long battery life how hrs is way too little should at least last hr
Huawei,P50 Pocket,straight samsung flip copy their designs and specs are totally different are you blind
Huawei,P50 Pocket,way better than samsung flip copy in being bad flip phone no google play services only up to support although dont use worse software support or year software update less than flip battery is worse although it has bigger battery it has better cameras than the flip but not worth the higher price just for the cameras
Huawei,P50 Pocket,after meet good huawei sales person finally can handle huawei phone and loving it so much because of the camera and battery is better than samsung and iphone everi swear
Huawei,P50 Pocket,they cut google out of huaweis phones because id they didnt of sold phones woulfd have been huaweis phoneslook at this compared to the samsung its completely on another level was amazingso much spectacular phonesthe sad part we the customers are the ones losing
Huawei,P50 Pocket,ugliest camera for that price and no what the what no one needs actually just works fine isnt it plus if compare it to samsungs it seems like it ws much more leveled up im not being biased here cuz im actually samsung user
Huawei,P50 Pocket,good luck viewing youtube using google services creating accounts having an email or instal more just get the pro maybe that phone is the last one with google
Huawei,P50 Pocket,can we talk without unfolding no
Huawei,P50 Pocket,im not sure if this phone use usbc as michael fisher aka mrmobile tweeted about this phone in wired desktop mode httpstwittercomcaptainphonesstatusstsxzhbvydelvcjvaa
Huawei,P50 Pocket,kf jan so you can make foldable with memory card slot hope more company will make memory card more its actually nano slot which is so expensive for me lol
Huawei,P50 Pocket,without google services still better than iphone without finger id and fsst charging
Huawei,P50 Pocket,nice phone really appreciate the fact that it has an expandable memory that others are running away from
Huawei,P50 Pocket,if had more money would buy it in heartbeat im not google slave
Huawei,P50 Pocket,for gi smell lg way
Huawei,P50 Pocket,looks like they used display from wrist watch on the back is it
Huawei,P50 Pocket,is inch with this clamshell huawei consider big screen phone or upper middle or middle
Huawei,P50 Pocket,dont care about gapps as it just drains more battery constantly running in background whats more good luck viewing youtube using google services creating accounts having an email or installing apps and having them run properly then
Huawei,P50 Pocket,so you can make foldable with memory card slot hope more company will make memory card slotmicrosd slot to be specific
Huawei,P50 Pocket,if they still had gapps this would turn so many heads over here like this no one really cares dont care about gapps as it just drains more battery constantly running in background whats important are social apps like fb twitter whatsapp etc streaming apps like netflix amazon video etc
Huawei,P50 Pocket,think flipv is enough know that is in low spes but hauwei why euro can get tb more wait till apple enter the folding phone market then charge eu
Huawei,P50 Pocket,sd chipset what guess youve been living under rock when unclesam banned from using tech
Huawei,P50 Pocket,you do not your nick says literally that what about my nick that im from kosovo yeah am london united kingdom is where live helloooooooooooooooooooooo
Huawei,P50 Pocket,how do you mean available smart part of the cities live in london and use three network more you do not your nick says literally that
Huawei,P50 Pocket,wish some could but me
Huawei,P50 Pocket,better than galaxy flip but still whats the point of having dont get why people complain about especially one that dont have in their area yet for about years at least will be available only in small parts of the cities till then whoever buy this phone will look for an upgrade or it will already have new device so dont get it still think it is bit overpriced but for different reasons
Huawei,P50 Pocket,you are rational realistbut what you said doesnt matter for richer who wanna buy it man rich peopel are fools whuich instead of helping others and saving our planet leading ordinary people into doom which has been created by rich people for that case many borders been pushed to be accepted as standart for most people in most countries
Huawei,P50 Pocket,agree on this for every use its shld be good pro is still working well in more unfortunately at least for me the updates had rendered the camera almost useless compared to years ago
Huawei,P50 Pocket,to me after the motorola razr this is best looking foldable and have best specs of any foldable out there
Huawei,P50 Pocket,gapless hinge is actually really really bad and guarantee once more people start buying thi more the razr manages gapless hinge with plastic lip around the perimeter of the display which circumvents that problem cant see it on the product photos but im sure it has it all these foldables do to ensure when youre snapping them shut you arent slamming display to display
Huawei,P50 Pocket,well thiis definitely looks like best foldable the market with its specs when comes to more you are rational realistbut what you said doesnt matter for richer who wanna buy it
Huawei,P50 Pocket,us has ban on huawei no big deal
Huawei,P50 Pocket,huuuh no where are you going huawei us has ban on huawei
Huawei,P50 Pocket,mm too tall and too wide for one handed use prefer samsung galaxy flip than this dont need such big screen inch with poor single hand usage
Huawei,P50 Pocket,deleted post some do but not you and actually but still theres phone for most of us out there except for those who want real big display phone like the mate like me everyone else can find phone guees
Huawei,P50 Pocket,about is true but this is unarguably not better than flip in any mean the gapless hinge system is promising on the flip since theres gap and the display has plastic layer fine coat of lintdust always makes it onto the display
Huawei,P50 Pocket,looks expensive
Huawei,P50 Pocket,all the people complaining about the price are right but do think that the price will drop more about is true but this is unarguably not better than flip in any mean
Huawei,P50 Pocket,not only theres no for tht price theres no ois too
Huawei,P50 Pocket,for usbc thought that only xiaomi would be smoking for that kind of thing even samsung can give usbc despite disabling video output support
Huawei,P50 Pocket,this phone seems to reuse old components of the pro charging mp camera however more agree on this for every use its shld be good pro is still working well in unless google tweak some major changes gaming wise and especially with this form factor not recommended
Huawei,P50 Pocket,pocket in china silverblack look like gold color belong to more the cheapest flip in my country is so would still go for it anyways
Huawei,P50 Pocket,high rate euro
Huawei,P50 Pocket,we have kind mp one with imx honor httpsmgsmarenacomhonorxgphp another with imx huawei httpsmgsmarenacomhuaweipphp
Huawei,P50 Pocket,when comes to foldables razr by motorola looks best in every aspect its most beautifull designed foldable phone ever build when comes to features and overall specs huawei is the winner for anything else samsung or flexpai shoud do its work but to my honest opinion since foldables are heavy thick and unreasonable with bad battery endurance fragile screens and very expensive any half baked xiaomi bar phone does lot better job for lot less money
Huawei,P50 Pocket,nice design but unfortunately would go for flip if would have to buy flip phones sin more pocket in china silverblack look like gold color belong to version still no selling oppo find
Huawei,P50 Pocket,with this battery belong to the garbage
Huawei,P50 Pocket,what pretty sure its running windows all of you are blind its obviously symbian
Huawei,P50 Pocket,after pro ultra no phones get close to optical zoom no phones more both the iqoo and pro have optical zoom but yes iqoo pro is better in that regards
Huawei,P50 Pocket,no its definitely ios what pretty sure its running windows
Huawei,P50 Pocket,so will this launch globally with harmony os
Huawei,P50 Pocket,is harmony os android or not no its definitely ios
Huawei,P50 Pocket,better
Huawei,P50 Pocket,very great design this is the best flip phone for me really like the design but dont wanna buy it because loved the design but dont wanna use flip or foldable phone will just wait for
Huawei,P50 Pocket,flip razr pocket huaweis foldable clamshell is the worstlooking more id say razr galaxy flip when it comes to styling samsungs flip still look like generic bar smartphone motorola got much betterlooking design than samsung if im really going to complain just one thing about the flip its the lack of samsung dex support by right it should have no problem having one since it runs on the same snapdragon chipset as the fold and the series
Huawei,P50 Pocket,it looks elegant well done
Huawei,P50 Pocket,anyway the body shape its better than oneplus pro especially the rear cam bcuz pro its too ugly
Huawei,P50 Pocket,need nm memoryhuawei type type
Huawei,P50 Pocket,for models billionaires
Huawei,P50 Pro,looking forward
Huawei,P50 Pro,looking back at this phones camera performance only noticed just now on how utterly brilliant the zoom photos are expect to see the usual oversharpened effect but im not seeing one at all heck even dare to say that its nokia pureview and nokia lumia like quality it is that impressive if theres one thing this phones telephoto camera shows it shows that quad bayer never always been the right sensor for lossless zoom even with demosaic native rgb sensor is still the right and best choice especially if it can do oversampling like those two aformentioned nokia phones
Huawei,P50 Pro,ok half of the photos in the review are extremely soft and out of focus is there prominent more dear buy huawei pro global version the day picture of camera is not good and the night camera picture is very good its software issues or camera issues can you solve this problem
Huawei,P50 Pro,id love to add huawei to my collection but it first needs to be rootable
Huawei,P50 Pro,there arent any kirin chips left that huawei could use and they cant produce any more pretty much stuck in rut no to compete no google services leica just left them for xiaomi id say the future for them has not been bright ever since the us ban
Huawei,P50 Pro,finally the last rear camera is the mp zoom snapper the sensor has proper bayer fi more wish they used high megapixel bayer filter at this would solve the zoom gap problem
Huawei,P50 Pro,it has mm mm per exif ois periscopic lens no its not mm lens mm is specification for the field of view which depends on the sensor size its mm lens
Huawei,P50 Pro,google isnt the issue its the ready connectivity and more apps to run on their own os dont talk about privacy and all cause most of us know that apple and google isnt doing the same they just have different ways to do it
Huawei,P50 Pro,im still using my mate pro because is great phone and secondly monochome camera love black and white photos sinse then ive been waiting for new phone with monochome camera but nothing came out now pro had that camera but with no google servicessorry huawei
Huawei,P50 Pro,the mp monochrome camera saves mp photos my assumption is that they use quad bayer sensor without the colour filter array but with pixel binning then it might be rather megapixel sensor and would explain this behaviour
Huawei,P50 Pro,agree the pro was better overall package huawei made no compromises when it come more so amazing
Huawei,P50 Pro,so basically phone worse than pro wow agree the pro was better overall package huawei made no compromises when it comes to cameras except not using new sensor sad to see it be like this for the first time in generations but at least the camera is good it really pains me to see the rest of the phone so poor this is not reaching the standards huawei was famous for reaching in either performance or battery life
Huawei,P50 Pro,charger in the box and case both cost lol
Huawei,P50 Pro,still proprietary nanomemory theyre crazy or what better than what all of bbk apple google and honor offers
Huawei,P50 Pro,no no gms terrible battery life why should someone pay euro for that charger in the box and case
Huawei,P50 Pro,hey looked through the pro and monochome modes and found no option to use pro mode with the more thank you for looking it up
Huawei,P50 Pro,wow saw battery test with kirin it was almost as good as pro max snapdragon is batte more huawei wants to use the kirin for the pro but they have limited stock of the chipset tsmc is not allowed to make kirin anymore for huawei under the us ban
Huawei,P50 Pro,an interesting versatile compact camera with plenty of smartphone features butdo not buy if you look for smartphone definitely not worth the money with cropped software
Huawei,P50 Pro,great thing about manual mode with raw output is you can get awesome quality with long exposure at night thats why even if auto performance is bad you can get way way better results then not every brand bring manualraw to superwide and tele though amount of detail with iso vs iso sec is different at least for still subjects otherwise they can as well use mp sensor since details are at that level
Huawei,P50 Pro,it doesnt make any sense this price without the store and camera is beast but in terms of processing xiaomi is considerably ahead with more natural looks no one in the market can match it imo except for the zoomit looks even better than the zoom pic incredible huawei is jewel and quite niche smartphone just like sony latest cameraphone
Huawei,P50 Pro,on the forums in my country people seems to have no problem with battery life but contrary dont know why the pro global is bad the china kirin version has battery life as good as apple pro max despite not using ltpo tech not to mention its cpu and gpu is faster than any android just check technick channel
Huawei,P50 Pro,even su is better choice let alone su
Huawei,P50 Pro,gsm keep talking about the pill shaped cut out as problem on pro ive been using the phone for year and its no problem at all its as distracting as single cutout in the centre tbh you focus more at the centre if the screen than top left so actually notice centre single cutout than the pill far more plus complaining about dedicated depth and biometrics camera that creates perfect bokeh effects and actual face biometrics that works in complete darkness vs nothingfake face unlock ok gsm ok sometimes question the people doing the reviews and if they actually give proper and fair evaluations half the time unless your samsung or apple then theyll over sell them
Huawei,P50 Pro,endurance rly bad on the forums in my country people seems to have no problem with battery life but contrary
Huawei,P50 Pro,the unit used by phone arena also has blurry main camera
Huawei,P50 Pro,not beautiful device design looks outdated two circles is ugly huawei series is going down
Huawei,P50 Pro,hahaha what joke phone endurance and no google play servcies yes lets all go buyu this garbage xdxd
Huawei,P50 Pro,bad choice to use sd housefire
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei fast charge is behind other rivals also battery management is poor even with chip
Huawei,P50 Pro,thats last years phone year old hardware why do we get it now how about king of old hardwaresapple
Huawei,P50 Pro,in photo comparison tool ultra looks way better more details less artifacts more natural colors
Huawei,P50 Pro,nova main camera turned to be much better
Huawei,P50 Pro,its simply overpriced hardwarewise its good software well thats where more if the bootloader was unlocked then the whole lack of google services would be less of issue really huawei should consider giving the option back to unlock it
Huawei,P50 Pro,tbh the cameras photo quality is not that bad im really impressed with the daylight photos including the zoom cant say the same for lowlight photos though the night mode does give somewhat better detail purity but it doesnt really impress me much nevertheless not bad phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,cool designs
Huawei,P50 Pro,as usual huaweis camera performance is unmatched truly impressive performance from all cameras the mediocre battery life is bit of bummer though as weve come to expect excellent battery life from huawei phones guess moving from kirin to snapdragon is the culprit for that still overall it seems like pretty good flagship with somewhat original design great specs
Huawei,P50 Pro,knowing huawei they provide raw support on all sensors since days yeah looking closely on the camera app screenshot there is an option to choose jpg on top left just curious to know if we can get true monochrome raw
Huawei,P50 Pro,in the review in the design part it says the screen may appear curved but it more it means the screen is curved the display is flat
Huawei,P50 Pro,no mention of raw photos gsmarena can it take bw raw photos knowing huawei they provide raw support on all sensors since days
Huawei,P50 Pro,so lets review curved glass easy to break and hard and expensive to fix screen with max nits mediocre for flagship snapdragon with only that throttles in no hdr support netflix in sd lol battery life wow dollars phone can pass loudness score very mediocre android is already here no google play no voice assistant gets hot while benchmarking or gaming main camera that blurs half the photo no proof its an isolated case ultrawide camera with poor autofocus proprietary card slot no headphone jack all of this for euro wow
Huawei,P50 Pro,for the first time in history huaweis phones doesnt have an better battery life more no point in selling it for that price as it would probably loose money the chip and no gms doesnt save any money for the company in fact it probably costs more snapdragon are likely to charge them extra for the chip as they need to produce and sell it in small quantities just for huawei also not being able to use gms means they have to spend lot more money than other android brands developing their own software alternatives in reality this makes their phones not that competitive in terms of price so very small number of consumers are likely to choose this phone itll probably be years before they can access flagship level chips again if they can survive in the smartphone business for that long think the main selling points of huawei phones before the us ban were the kirin chipsets and cameras but now they cant even use their own chipsets and cant access custom camera sensors anymore without special licesne at least from sony or samsung
Huawei,P50 Pro,the bw photos look amazing im getting ricoh leica vibes
Huawei,P50 Pro,goes to show that sd really contributes to an overall horrible battery life whichever device this is put in suspect the same with any sd gen device
Huawei,P50 Pro,huaweis appgallery handles the default app installations but we hate that it shows ads almost every time you open it we dont find this solution userfriendly but we guess the focus with this feature has been to help developers promote their apps dont like second ads when opening appgallery either in my experience however dont see ads every time visit appgallery once appgallery is opened and is in the background it doesnt show ads next time go to appgallery again even when fresh launch appgallery sometimes it shows an ad sometimes doesnt so actually dont see ads most of the time im not specifically pro user but doubt the pro should be different for this matter considering that the app is the same by the way unlike apple huawei appgallery does not put ads first above what users actually type and search for on the search result pages
Huawei,P50 Pro,the ultrawide camera is surprisingly hood it is just cheap small mp sensor smaller than the mp ones on ultra or even the bbk ultrawides which are mp imx it doesnt stand chance against bbk ones especially vivo pro plus ultrawide but for mp inch sensor it is superb that the shots at night was that bright but that green tint is just too much
Huawei,P50 Pro,in the camera department can you guys please use aperture mode instead of portrait mode the main camera is also the primary portrait shooter and it does brilliant job the mp portraits zoom we took with it offer proficient subject separation and naturallooking blur while the subjects remain detailed and sharp the colors and the dynamic range and quite good too there are more zoom levels within the portrait mode but they provide digital zoom over the main camera and save pretty soft portraits portraits are soft and has beauty as well as skjn smoothing on its software try aperture mode please remember the mate pro camera comparison review aperture mode is way better than portrait mode in terms of details
Huawei,P50 Pro,will pay maximum of or for this
Huawei,P50 Pro,the endurance was very poor while in standby also numbers are low for screen below qhd anyway not worth in magic pro is better phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,the battery scores of the pro reminds me of flagships from when phones came with mah battery and nm chipsets
Huawei,P50 Pro,im disappointed by the battery life but very very nice phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,great phone but crippled with no real huawei fault before the ban huawei was destroying competition and thenwell you know the story apple is just overpriced rubbish samsung soso going apple way xiaomi is halfbaked semigood manufacturer sony thinks its still and that they are relevant still vivo oppo etc are not important huawei was real treath and they took care of it
Huawei,P50 Pro,its shame what usa did to huawei imagine something similar happening elsewhere oh wait novak dokovic had similar experience if youre the best they will hurt you huawei had the best phones on the market and even today they would be the best but nobody will buy them with no google services they are rather expensive and lack of google is problem usually people just go to samsung as an easy fix apple is terrible had iphone for month and its rubbish had iphone before that like years ago and same problems are still there so many annoying things like no permanent numbers row in keyboard
Huawei,P50 Pro,when did they launch magic pro with google play thought it was in china only
Huawei,P50 Pro,hello what is your experience is this best phone as compared iphone
Huawei,P50 Pro,how to install whatsapp if it saying download offial whatsapp but even if download its still more you can do microg then gbox and you can get the playstore from gbox and install any app from the play store after no problem only things that dont work as far as know are google wallet and android auto have whatsapp even before gbox and microg used to use apkpure for everything and most stuff still was working fine
Huawei,P50 Pro,yes install micro and then download store for store replacement can use most the more how to install whatsapp if it saying download offial whatsapp but even if download its still say the samething
Huawei,P50 Pro,for anyone interested in this phone in as second hand buy yes battery life is pret more bought this phone like days ago battery at and the phone is clean traded my oneplus for it and paid jod the oneplus phone was terrible actually love this phone tried like flagship phones and the huawei pro is the top this phone is amazing and battery is great for me but the phone sadly feels warm in normal usage and sometimes hot it kinda depends on the weather and in jordan its hot in summer charge the phone times day from to sometimes to the phone is great but not the best but its decent for its price my list for the top phones tried this year samsung huawei mate huawei pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,hello there am looking to by an used pro so was wondering is it possible to install more yes install micro and then download store for store replacement can use most the apps available only chatgpt is unavailable

Huawei,P50 Pro,gd pinwheel apr now my pro is on android but with severe wifi issues support only ghz wifi take it in count
Huawei,P50 Pro,theres usd brand new one being sold near my place xd
Huawei,P50 Pro,people hate on the design actually like it just needed matt finish instead of glossy
Huawei,P50 Pro,now my pro is on android but with severe wifi issues
Huawei,P50 Pro,need help im between these models the pro pro and pocket which of these more huawei pro better color accuracy than huawei pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,also just saw the pro is one of the devices in the emui beta list which means it more the mate pro is still getting updated lol
Huawei,P50 Pro,id say its worth it for the most part aside from the sds poor efficiency more agree with you actually battery life is little better when you use wifi connections then mobile data its been years since get this phone and camera is still great compare to others flagships models have gspace wich can do all my jobs aobut google accounts after all will rate this phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,for at fair condition without issues is this worth it its gb variant sd id say its worth it for the most part aside from the sds poor efficiency when it comes to battery life im pretty happy with mine its not laggy display is great speakers are not the loudest however sound quality is still one of the best ive heard on phone video all around even on the selfie which very importantly imo also has autofocus barely any phones have that even today and the cameras in general can still give current flagships run for their money havent had the need to install gbox or gspace for the two years ive had the phone been running everything need just fine still getting security updates as well just got one today actually dont know how much longer they gonna support it sometimes notifications dont come unless you open the app dont know how much of this is an issue with huawei and how much is issues with the apps dont have gms phone to compare
Huawei,P50 Pro,no disagree with you what is the highest resolution does your tv supports my tv is more oh nice ive learned lot from you nice comment
Huawei,P50 Pro,my pro keeps freezing for more than mins and the it comes back again after hold the lo more no problems with that issues only problem is wifi lag on ghz wifi connect and low batteey range no overheating and no lags no jsk says that the camera is better in mate pro plus then pro and it is not true mate pro plus have better camera compare to pro but it is not better little better he overrated that compare am talking about eu version of pro with sd
Huawei,P50 Pro,this is expensive smartphone so where is option think samsung is the best optio more no disagree with you what is the highest resolution does your tv supports my tv is miniled tv from samsung over half percentage of people in and even will and using tv due to the fact that tv is the most popular and budget friendly tv out there do you have tv in your home are you professional filmmaker do you know the truth firstly tv is not that popular and not even budget friendly to the most of the people who are living currently secondly if you want and need an feature then you should probably be professional filmmaker or advertisment company even instagram tiktok facebook and twitter doesnt support or lastly the reason why samsung is advertising feature is that they want to sell their super highend tv lineup to make more money then why other companies like xiaomi is also putting feature on their phones because other companies like xiaomi vivo and etc are competing with samsung do you know something iphone pro max even without an video capability could capture stunning videos have you watched the scary fast event from apple the whole presentation was shot on the iphone pro or max in not in
Huawei,P50 Pro,would have been better if it had sadly no thats the reason why huawei launched the mate series
Huawei,P50 Pro,without leica huawei phones would look terrible if you pay attention to the camera quality disagree with you currently own the mate pro plus and my previous phone was pro honestly to tell the truth mate pro pluss camera is much more better to be exact about times better in my experience compared to the pro better colors better zoom capabilities better video performance better ultra wide shots better low light shots better detail and the mate pro plus excels every aspects of photography and videography compared to the pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,anybody have problem with keyboard in landscape mode letters disapear just blank white in more no didnt have any of those problems
Huawei,P50 Pro,hello is it worthy to change huawei pro to huawei pro just one criterion is camera more no its not worth it just wait for the pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,hi am comparing pro vs mate which one will be better choice at their given price more overall think mate is better than the pro except for the display refresh rate
Huawei,P50 Pro,hows the battery life on this phone ive used the pro in the past which had gr more its just mediocre just wait for the pro if youre planning to upgrade
Huawei,P50 Pro,superfast charge doesnt work after emui update only quick charge appears both usb more no its not true after received the emui update on my pro the phones charging speed radically boosted
Huawei,P50 Pro,how is performance the huawei pro this phones worth buying good or not reply me have used this phoneglobal version for year it performs ok but has serious overheating problems for example when play car parking multiplayer the phone temperature goes up to over degrees celsius even with the phone cooler was activated and also when use the phones camera for minute it just gets hot really hot but the overheating problem occurs only in summer time and the other cons is that the battery life is not good the phones screen on time is only hours minutes always turn on the gps and high brightness so need to charge it times day if you are going to use pro only in winter time then there will be no any overheating issues despite the two major factors the phone is worth it but if were you would wait for the pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,can somebody help me encountered problems with the unit and its just been only wee more check apps running background and disable any that may be causing any battery draining issues also opt out of sending any diagnostic data disable syncing for all accounts might be software or hardware issue update software if you can if not software contact huawei might have to replace display
Huawei,P50 Pro,update the device to emui and enjoy the much longer battery life yes after instaling emui battery life is longer only problem is again wifi connection on ghz ruters and wifi lag same problem at start with emui
Huawei,P50 Pro,ok good phone but it isnt any google apps or another apk of android if it capable to sideload google apps and apk of android apps it will be nice harmony os next will be no of android apps apk sideload
Huawei,P50 Pro,not agree any something the camera is better on pro then pro because have booth te more oh and what improvement what saw is in portrait mode give more detailsin normal photo mode nope
Huawei,P50 Pro,recomend all to stay on huawei pro or mate pro the last phones with kirin versionbc more not agree any something the camera is better on pro then pro because have booth telephones yes there are issues but you have version pro with sd had all two version first version is like you says battery terrible heating bag second is better no heating battery better camera perfect now use the second version with sd and its work normal we will see for how long and yes they upgrade wifi because he had wifi issues when it is connected on ghz router
Huawei,P50 Pro,bought it months ago from miranda nswhavent used it because no google play but ke more you really dont need google play store you can still side load all the apps you need

Huawei,P50 Pro,no google services is so haaard you can install gspace
Huawei,P50 Pro,the hardware is excellent people who saw photos made using this camera got almost hypnotized but the software department cannot be praised no fps no fps no fps no switching between htz huawei should offer software like protake or filmic pro with compatibility for gimbals and that will attract many more enthusiastic videographers
Huawei,P50 Pro,useless phone time to time it kicks you out of the apps it does not have mobile pay app more bro its appalling to compare two year app with other apps for years try and be great critics when it matters ok
Huawei,P50 Pro,after months using the ppro my honnest review as ppro user for years im gonna more one question how many second you needed to take night photo on sd version is second and its the greatest night photo ever seen day photo very good have pro and compared head to head but issues on sd like wifi lag somethime batery problem is at very low level here

Huawei,P50 Pro,the hdr option in camera is missing in my pro emui do you guys experienced the same issue
Huawei,P50 Pro,iphones might have smaller capacity batteries but the software optimization means they beat mo more still no charging brick
Huawei,P50 Pro,can anyone review harmonyos have matepad pro with harmony without google services and it works really well it feels powerful and the best thing you can add gspace playstore emulator works almost as any other android device

Huawei,P50 Pro,sorry to say to you that you do not understand any thing this selfie camera is the best in th more iphones might have smaller capacity batteries but the software optimization means they beat most androids with chunkier batteries
Huawei,P50 Pro,shldnt call this phone call it toaster
Huawei,P50 Pro,dont bother ive had to stop using my pro as daily driver because of the goo more if you searched bit more than minutes you would see that are replacements for the google services youyube and pretty much everything else you dont need petal or use the browser yes its annoying but if you really depend on google apps then this phone is not for you get samsung or pixel
Huawei,P50 Pro,is this using type cable yes it has usbc cable
Huawei,P50 Pro,it is waste mobile battery is verry waste have you ever tried it
Huawei,P50 Pro,was about to buy pro but it seems that huawei phones have problem on the camera my huaw more hade the same problem last week on the pro brought my phone to the service office and they replaced new camera because pdaf was not working properly huawei gave extended warranty for ppro so didnt have to pay anything
Huawei,P50 Pro,so is sd or kirin because see online both models and idk what is true europe model to br more chinese models come with kirin and overseas models come with an sd
Huawei,P50 Pro,im curious about the current state of play of huawei and their android devices from my limited understanding the harmonyos is not meant to be major os but to be conduit to connect iot devices using available platforms windows android maybe even linux etc so for their smartphones and tablets theyre still using android as base even in emui global edition and harmonyos cn edition are they currently developing new smartphone or tablet os using aosp android open source project what will happen when the android is no longer supported is it sink or swim situation and would that make us customers gamble to buy any huawei smartphones in given the end of life date for android is likely to be sep this year or the latest oct in line with pixel end of life date android end of life was sep google last android devices were pixel released in will be supported until oct or pixel released in will be supported until oct pixel was already on android
Huawei,P50 Pro,to be honest something is missing on this phone from the camera to it battery and sometimes it overheat but regardless love huawei believe its not their intentions
Huawei,P50 Pro,but guys until when are we not goona see google services on these new huawei smartestphones probably until the usa admit that they are not the economy in the world anymore and stop preventing the growth of nonamerican companies
Huawei,P50 Pro,hiya have the pro mate and looking at another hauwei phone but was scared off due to sa more dont bother ive had to stop using my pro as daily driver because of the google problem its not even just google apps because lot of apps run through google play or google protocols you get half the apps even on apkpure and aptoide that wont work still needs gms authentication basically youre going to have to rely heavily on petal searchweb browser for pretty much everything have to use brave browser for youtube my bank pretty much all takeaway and taxi ordering great devices just the lack of google is now huge problem considering the monopoly of apple and google being essentially the only os of choice
Huawei,P50 Pro,kirin chips in this case are much better in case youre curious the sd wins in short more ive got huawei pro performance mode only gives you better benchmark results doesnt really do anything in the real world so thats wrong day to day performance you wont see difference between kirin snapdragon gen and any applesamsung or mediatek chip in the premium market unless you absolutely pushing your device and the chip to its limits all the time and even then youll get stupid levels of throttling from current top end chips like exynos gen and in apple devices
Huawei,P50 Pro,snapdragon is know for its heating problemi dont know about the kirin because ha more kirin chips in this case are much better in case youre curious the sd wins in short burst performance but the kirin wins in terms of sustained performance however this is with the performance mode enabled without it all huawei phones with kirin chips generally have quite mediocre performance in intense gaming due to power efficiency being the main priority but flip the performance toggle on and the chips will perform at their fullest for example in normal mode my pros kirin scores sustained score in the throttling app after minutes itll take minute breaks at to cool down but otherwise its pretty much always at power as for dmark slingshot extreme it scored sustained points however in performance mode the picture changes drastically the sustained score gets ramped up from to sustained do be aware that the oneminute breaks are now at instead of and in dmark opencl the sustained score gets bumped up to points the kirin will behave like this as well mediocre but hyperefficient performance in normal mode but with dramatically improved performance mode that will not come at the cost of severe throttling the sd throws that book completely aside it follows huaweis throttling protocol but offers substantially higher peak performance with severe throttling simply put the sd lacks the refinement and flexibility of the kirin
Huawei,P50 Pro,im using and im loving it face id is the best day or night selfie great day more hiya have the pro mate and looking at another hauwei phone but was scared off due to sanctions with google so your saying can still use all my google products still if download apkpure will it also continue to back up photos to google photos can use drive gmail and google pay thanks in advance
Huawei,P50 Pro,am thinking to buy this phone but it seems that the global version only have the snapdragon more snapdragon is know for its heating problemi dont know about the kirin because havent owned or used huawei phones
Huawei,P50 Pro,if order this phone from china with kirin will technically work in region of europe thought the phone only support
Huawei,P50 Pro,just checking the pro mp images in the studio photo comparison tool vs other mp phones more bad compression
Huawei,P50 Pro,use pro and its absolutely fantastic although shattered my bottom camera jue to dog walking and dog nail going in dogs fine but still take great videos and wide angle photos still have my pro and that was amazing too might upgrade once order new camera lens cover and put mine up for sale whats the best hauwei for photography these days thats all care about mobile for haha
Huawei,P50 Pro,will stay with my mate pro not worth it buying new one unless you looking for better camera
Huawei,P50 Pro,ill go for mate pro or pro plus ready and nice design is pricey lack of the camera is ok
Huawei,P50 Pro,this is such good device but night mode have issues green tint you may check it here httpswwwredditcomrhuaweicommentstaszyinightmodeconcernsforppro
Huawei,P50 Pro,guys would like to buy new phone and am thinking between pro samsung ultra or more using ppro and ppro just bot the pro battery is superb and camera is still incomparable used to have pro but was stolen coming from huawei user many chamges had been made to the ppro and id still go with the as it has options if its the camera after ur best bet is pro ad the ip rating for water resist is astounding
Huawei,P50 Pro,comparing the with the they share the same chipsets and processors samsung will win more huawei wins always at battery well at least the kirin version will
Huawei,P50 Pro,just
Huawei,P50 Pro,tried to compare this phome to my find pro with android main camera find pro is better to my shock huawei have bad high res main cam since series at full high res mode even with ai mode which you need to held the phone sec the result is bit less sharp and detailed than my find pro telephoto have bit better color and detail but roughly looks the same at hybrid zoom screen using xtra color mode on my find pro and still lose to the color gamut on pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,still better option is mate pro better battery connection etc only camera is better wi more agree but sizewise pro is perfect they just compromise on battery life is it because kirin has better power consumption than sd
Huawei,P50 Pro,not that anybody cares since physics was never your passion but the main sensor on this is too small at xiaomi has equal size on phones also why is suddenly sensor size huawei secret
Huawei,P50 Pro,does the pro has global version
Huawei,P50 Pro,iamjoshuabcxvii feb the camera system is what always like about huawei or mate series but the lack of gms ser more its not huaweis fault its the us ban that doesnt allow them to use processors if you find necessary then buy mate pro it has kirin but with
Huawei,P50 Pro,never liked huawi or honor but this one looks promising until the stupid price hit you like fat dong mean am against samsung pricing but they are nice value compared to this
Huawei,P50 Pro,its good unit though the camera feature light painting is nowhere to be found sad
Huawei,P50 Pro,iamjoshuabcxvii feb just saw this phone in person earlier was eyeing this for the great camera hardware but more you can take video with ultrawide
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei used to make great phones with best battery lifeh with missing of google and mid more agree they had really geat kirin socs that can beatout qualcommapple but after unclesam ban they no longer sell phones with kirin socs outside china
Huawei,P50 Pro,dont buy huawei products they cannot fix my years old laptop because they don more they offered you voucher apple slapped me with dollar bill when they repaired mac that had its warranty expire months ago
Huawei,P50 Pro,just got today wahahhahaaa love the design and the material they used very elegant lo more congrats to you guess you buy the china version then any difficulties to operate it
Huawei,P50 Pro,hello all have old huawei pro which has old kirin chipset think to buy pro but more you can watch gsmarenas youtube video review about pro they have answer for your questions there
Huawei,P50 Pro,buy real camera cheaper and better thats another thing im talking in terms of mobile camera
Huawei,P50 Pro,unprecedented unparalleled image quality far better than those of galaxies pixels and iphones buy real camera cheaper and better
Huawei,P50 Pro,bravo huawei despite of the total war declared on you by some big and fearful enemies you survive its an old saying that states that any kick in the but is one step forward those big entities which we all know who they are just could not compete with huaweis excellent products both in quality and price so they decided that huawei is spying tried to eliminate them and impose monopoly on the market but guess what people are not stupid and huawei do fight and fight well live in europe and decided to say no to those big dogs and now really think at buying one huawei although some european countries still are in line with the us decisions this will not last in europe
Huawei,P50 Pro,the us said huawei collect your mobile data but the us never said apple collect your data
Huawei,P50 Pro,the camera system is what always like about huawei or mate series but the lack of gms service is already quite the turn off but still considerable since we could use gspace but no in this day of age of flagship devices carrying no thanks plan to use flagship phone for years and if this doesnt even have that would greatly reduce the useability of this device to yrs only as networks continually expand
Huawei,P50 Pro,wake up were talking about the it is rather would say an advantage
Huawei,P50 Pro,my still works well and love it huawei makes pretty good devices the only issue is the more wake up were talking about the
Huawei,P50 Pro,ummm ghz yo huawei being banned and such they should be trying to prove themselves to the public now if got this phone itd be slower than my current motorola edge pro lol hauwei just gonna fail
Huawei,P50 Pro,is my last concern dont need the speeds of are more than enough not to men more absolutely
Huawei,P50 Pro,why is europe getting shafted out of the white pink models
Huawei,P50 Pro,real shame with how huawei got shafted they do make some nice devices
Huawei,P50 Pro,it is selling today in bulgaria at eurthis is complete bs it was eur on release more that is because of tax shipping cost etc
Huawei,P50 Pro,when will get phone which all spare parts user replaceable or upgradable

Huawei,P50 Pro,no no buy what ridiculous decision to release nong phone globally in is my last concern dont need the speeds of are more than enough not to mention that the coverage is very poor at least in my country the lack of gms is more of concern than the lack of
Huawei,P50 Pro,can use goggle
Huawei,P50 Pro,they are literally not allowed to sell enabled phones because of the us ban so is the more the pro plus will support
Huawei,P50 Pro,can this battery of pro last full day with single charge it has the best android battery
Huawei,P50 Pro,better buy the xiaomi pro half of the price but with almost same specs well youll get better camera in the pro if thats what you like to pay more for
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei still the best phone lol
Huawei,P50 Pro,just to let you know couldnt use anymore samsung note serious phone before us more but what
Huawei,P50 Pro,dear god the was already ugly enough but they somehow managed to make it worse
Huawei,P50 Pro,ppl when talking about banned google they mean google play service not goog more just to let you know couldnt use anymore samsung note serious phone before used huawei mate pro liked changing phones at least yearly samsung never be not even close to huawei sold the samsung and purchase pro but but has to be used because even if is new with specification for canada network and is not from canada network will not work canadian networks are locked you are not able to use phone what is not meant for canada strange but true recently purchase new realme master edition which has same frequencies what canada network has but couldnt use it not even on lte and no canadians are back to prehistoric era and selling year old models phones wow and of course iphones this market is only for stupid iphones and thats it newer and better technology is not anymore welcome to canada im sooooo frustrated on this move
Huawei,P50 Pro,didnt even realise this already released in august
Huawei,P50 Pro,just use vanced problem solved but what about all the other google services id rather get another phone with play services tbh even if this phone had play services id still not get it because the design is just too ugly
Huawei,P50 Pro,people may say what they want we shall support harmonyos and huawei eventually theu shall more me too bro
Huawei,P50 Pro,bruh you cant you google account without play services youd only be able to wa more just use vanced problem solved
Huawei,P50 Pro,yea yea totally they dont matter like banking apps tax management apps local shopping more as long as you think so
Huawei,P50 Pro,when buy samsung disable all gapps by knox so no it is not required by default but mo more yea yea totally they dont matter like banking apps tax management apps local shopping apps music apps any kind of subscriptions app you might have small business services that have their app only on playstore this or that who needs apps to manage their online stuff when you have pi ji ki browser my friend google is the law
Huawei,P50 Pro,also note that anything you need google for yuo acan do without youtube app is not needed and if you want that drug you used youtube vanced or pure tube
Huawei,P50 Pro,anyone knowing there is website called youtoubecom you can watch videos there more bruh you cant you google account without play services youd only be able to watch videos on youtubecom not save them like them or subscribe
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei would have wiped the floor with samsung if only the ban hadnt come in owned more im totally with you but once people got to know google they cant see anything else
Huawei,P50 Pro,bruh you cant even open youtube without play services got honor phone while back more anyone knowing there is website called youtoubecom you can watch videos there and its surprisingly similar to that youtube app couldnt imagine that something like this exists
Huawei,P50 Pro,pro camera still beats apple samsung in almost every aspect battery life is great
Huawei,P50 Pro,for what do you need google if you can have same apps without google services bruh you cant even open youtube without play services got honor phone while back without play services and it was absolutely horrible switched to the iphone pro now and im loving it
Huawei,P50 Pro,huwei unlocks at night with fingerface without the need of any light and it unlocks from ext more who cares about that when huawei doesnt have google anymore you need google for just about everything these days huawei should have just left the market like lg when they got banned now theyll make these phones with no one to buy them lol even their mid rangers arent worth
Huawei,P50 Pro,dont buy this phone if youre willing to spend this much money then get something more huwei unlocks at night with fingerface without the need of any light and it unlocks from extreme angles and almost each time the screen works like charm and its hard to mistype or hit wrong letter while typing message etc that is something samsung and iphone can dream of not to mention samsung messed up the and series with each update some things work again while others stop to work the only positive thing about samsung is that it has now the mp camera which beats whatever huawei can doafter all you cant beat mp with mp meanwhile huawei got its petal maps which works quite nice and some extreme amount of apps that ppl use on phone with google services is available too if now would want to buy reliable phone that works each time as intended then would go for huawei but for pictures would go for xiaomi samsung would be the last choice
Huawei,P50 Pro,get honor has google play and if you buy from hk company it has theres no reason to use google play it only contains apps with ads
Huawei,P50 Pro,very sadnot the greatest screen not google service only and still the best ever how get honor has google play and
Huawei,P50 Pro,use it the google services not working and very hard to ue it with it but comparing the mo more snap is if yo buy kirin version it works
Huawei,P50 Pro,the best ever think about it can you install apps from google play no can use more can you use of the apps you want yes do you need pure android no does it worth worth absolutelynot honor magic propro are better
Huawei,P50 Pro,how come huawei can sport sensor from sony sharp can do it with sen more actually sony is as about to release xperia alpha which imx inch sensor as the first android phone with announcement tomorrow huawei pro dont count not or even proper android
Huawei,P50 Pro,no it camera not the best google pixel iphone xpro its better than this guess the camera would be better as usual but lets wait for the real life tests
Huawei,P50 Pro,tf youre talking about it is less than except the above article says in two places
Huawei,P50 Pro,really love this phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,at least it has best camera in the world battery backup is good too and the great thing is th more no it camera not the best google pixel iphone xpro its better than this
Huawei,P50 Pro,no small battery ugly design and more for very high priceno way at least it has best camera in the world battery backup is good too and the great thing is that the phone is not tall like samsung and xiaomi that much
Huawei,P50 Pro,on huawei official site it says it is powered by snapdragon chip
Huawei,P50 Pro,the two camera groups look too big and ugly wow its the best ever all huawei haters should just get one then confirm
Huawei,P50 Pro,too expensive for the specs battery is below average even for its price
Huawei,P50 Pro,you will find these cameras on xiaomi too years later hope not lol
Huawei,P50 Pro,whose idea was to price this at no and only mah with in that thing nah more tf youre talking about it is less than
Huawei,P50 Pro,downside is the camera design and lacked of support no and small battery
Huawei,P50 Pro,my high taste didnt savor this ugly design what can say the two camera groups look too big and ugly
Huawei,P50 Pro,beauty is in the eyes of beholder my high taste didnt savor this ugly design what can say
Huawei,P50 Pro,the pro tops the dxomark for camera am comparing it to other top smartphones
Huawei,P50 Pro,the difference on and is not noticeable with small screen beside its not the more this is so underrated are your eyes so calibrated to screens look you will barely notice difference unless you full on compare it to display side by side just another one of those things on spec sheet like the number of cores and boosted hz like wtf its reallife performance that really matters and which cameras does it support and like your just making videos you just need good stabilisation and noisefree
Huawei,P50 Pro,no connectivity
Huawei,P50 Pro,lol see huawei is now copying samsung and putting mid range screens on their flagships the difference on and is not noticeable with small screen beside its not the resolution that count but the ppi will give more battery life than the
Huawei,P50 Pro,just dont all this price and it doesnt say it supports probably does though more beauty is in the eyes of beholder
Huawei,P50 Pro,hope it will launch globally
Huawei,P50 Pro,unfortunately for you the iphone is not as bad as you make it out to be the pro is th more and thats why only buying those with kirin chipsets wait ing for the mate series specs before deciding on whether to go with pro plus or mate series
Huawei,P50 Pro,am on and it does not have google have the phone for year now and its superb can more use google on huawei with vms pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,yep it definitely can visit that im using huawei without google services and by far more if you want google services install gspace app or if you need you tube install you tube vanced app
Huawei,P50 Pro,any ideas when it will be available in europe you need to think about the compatibility because its not going to come with any google products so think about it carefully before buying
Huawei,P50 Pro,are kidding right iphone more xpensive and they use sony cameras nothing good in it only more unfortunately for you the iphone is not as bad as you make it out to be the pro is the superior device to the iphone but thats because the pro belongs to the iphone pros league as for overheatingits sad that huawei switched to qualcomm for the later pro the sd is the one which will overheat as its made at samsung rather than the kirin and which are both made at tsmc the chips made in taiwan have proven to be the superior ones want evidence exynos chips come from samsungs fab which is where the sd is made
Huawei,P50 Pro,love it but will not buy no no googler play service can have real explanation of why you want wont accept the ansi might want it in the future until becomes extinct gimmick for consumers
Huawei,P50 Pro,not worth the money buy iphone the only advantage is the chip which is useless because ios does not have desktop mode
Huawei,P50 Pro,superb cameras smooth and easy to use no gms no problem im still can use google chrome as my main browser just like you use in pc
Huawei,P50 Pro,when the gb version variant
Huawei,P50 Pro,you wouldnt believe how many people can live without google go and check out rdegoogle more dont know what rdegoogle is you can live even without smartphone if we put it that way but use all the google services daily
Huawei,P50 Pro,what services does it use or does it use google no it uses huawei mobile services
Huawei,P50 Pro,theres also aurora store which is basically google play store its reference from sleeping beauty
Huawei,P50 Pro,whats harmony os and who would use such unknown os will do it
Huawei,P50 Pro,amazon appstore apkmirror apkpure apkupdater aptoide fdroid humble bundle qooapp sams more theres also aurora store which is basically google play store
Huawei,P50 Pro,is it still only available in china yep predict it will get released weeks after after the snapdragon version get released in china unfortunately kirin are not enough to power the european version of pro
Huawei,P50 Pro,your point being heshe just saying its good and give it try instead of whining personally agreeand im using the new os well on my pro china version apps can be lil challenging to understand for nonchineseasian users but its not big issue if are smarter than your phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,you cant review something if you cant get it is it still only available in china
Huawei,P50 Pro,everything is unknown for people who dont research or try things out just like you so more your point being
Huawei,P50 Pro,michael sep how will phone have when my mini laptop only uses its crazy where this world more wait till you see the fast charging on the iqoo pro and xiaomi mix
Huawei,P50 Pro,how will phone have when my mini laptop only uses its crazy where this world is heading
Huawei,P50 Pro,gsmarena wont review it you cant review something if you cant get it
Huawei,P50 Pro,its based on android so its based on linux with aosp layer for android compatibility sometimes ignorance isnt bliss
Huawei,P50 Pro,finally harmony os begins its journey huawei is really impressive
Huawei,P50 Pro,poor hauwei it had reached the top of the market even were threat the samsung and thing more cant wait
Huawei,P50 Pro,honestly would prefer to buy huawei phone than any other phone huawei is facing lot challenges but proofing it can give quality and decent smartphones some of the smartphones know is scam and being coned your hard earned money for specifications which does not deliver likes of samsung and xiaomi having mp main camera and mp selfies yet huawei with mp and mp emerges to be top performer on the other hand as long as the chipset is powerful and the phone is thats enough its not must for phone to be for it to be the best lastly gms does not matter as long as the device has search engines and basic apps to enable you install what you want with harmonyos you can still fetch gms services should you need them
Huawei,P50 Pro,oh wow youre not joking its not capable for about just more funny people you are do you even have and use network in your country it is like having uhd tv and watching sd programs lets be real is nowhere near done so phone for me is just good marketing at this moment
Huawei,P50 Pro,say hello to the last huawei phone outside china
Huawei,P50 Pro,return back to haha oh wow youre not joking its not capable for about just why
Huawei,P50 Pro,how does harmony work is it compatible in nigeria you can ask to the developer for more information about harmony os
Huawei,P50 Pro,fuking design of back camera what waste
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei pro front camera mp but dxomark is highest score in the world more thanks gee
Huawei,P50 Pro,front camera is very low only mp why huawei who will tell them what pixel binning is all those and mp selfies produce mp pictures so for an ultraish wide selfie camera is fine
Huawei,P50 Pro,since it doesnt access play storewhere can one download from that would be huawei app gallery
Huawei,P50 Pro,mr welli playstore did not drop from heavenits manmade and thus harmony can become tim more especially that huawei participated actively to the android development and android applications and in very big way
Huawei,P50 Pro,thumbs up to huawei despite the massive shaking you are still standing this is challenge more bravo
Huawei,P50 Pro,pls global launch and send phones to reviewers pls talk to us govement
Huawei,P50 Pro,im hyped for the huawei pro its great
Huawei,P50 Pro,the camera shape not good
Huawei,P50 Pro,how lol dont be fanboy
Huawei,P50 Pro,mkbhd is fake reviewer how lol
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei talked alot about software in their unveiling and seeing google use those puny mp ca more mkbhd is fake reviewer
Huawei,P50 Pro,guys this phone bam hope harmony is surprises ios and android users
Huawei,P50 Pro,love it because of its camera setup
Huawei,P50 Pro,useless no playstore just like you
Huawei,P50 Pro,very ugly
Huawei,P50 Pro,the battery size is too small compared flagship standard and whats with the monoch more man the first dual telephoto sensor was in the last year huawei mate pro plus so they know there work but samsung just cheating nothing else
Huawei,P50 Pro,indeed it best brand in the world but without play store forget itits not worth it
Huawei,P50 Pro,not as expected just too many better phones out there of cause there is too many but can you name it
Huawei,P50 Pro,cant seem to find it on aliexpress or anywhere for that matter only kirin versio more well mean the sd version isnt exclusive either but sd version is probably in production rm either way kirin doesnt overheat like frying pan and doesnt destroy battery life either it sure may lack raw power against sd but miles better battery and miles better in heat management kirin is cool without proper cooling sulotion yet sd still heats up bit with proper cooling
Huawei,P50 Pro,will they be able to restore the google play store no but honor will do look out for magic
Huawei,P50 Pro,can do the sd version its like euro lower or maybe even euro if not that much cant seem to find it on aliexpress or anywhere for that matter only kirin version is available at the moment
Huawei,P50 Pro,already available on aliexpress although the price is high over kirin version can do the sd version its like euro lower or maybe even euro if not that much
Huawei,P50 Pro,horrible camera looks like old tape recorder speaker ah yes live will be constantly staring at the back of ur phone cuz thats the display and the feotn is the back yes uno reverse card logic wow
Huawei,P50 Pro,the camaraderie is good but the layout of the camera does not look that nice
Huawei,P50 Pro,can make question to all persons who doesnt like huawei pro for its performance more you are right but to me my phone is an universal tool that almost replaced my pc so do my banking control my music that is setup with chromecast audio and speakers with build in chromecast the apps use dont get released other places than playstore and appstore also dont think that the phone will be released in country
Huawei,P50 Pro,why does hits have but hits huh
Huawei,P50 Pro,will buy it for huawei os
Huawei,P50 Pro,does it look the same as the one you use oooooof
Huawei,P50 Pro,just order it online using aliexpress is it global version does it have google
Huawei,P50 Pro,lol designers are no longer bothering about the shape and design of the mobile phone now its only the shape of the camera modules which matters
Huawei,P50 Pro,for the camera found at the bottom it should have been in the middle and the flash under it
Huawei,P50 Pro,does that really matter to you cuz it doesnt matter to me though here is the thing if more dont mind the fella he never experienced challenges of life to see the difference huawei might not be in good market share for phone business for now but the company would be back with bang
Huawei,P50 Pro,someone wrote about batteries being small believe theyre not perhaps they could round them to mah and thats it because dont know if its up to system optimization or what now but their batteries were always good speak from experience when had and and am average user could use the phone for days
Huawei,P50 Pro,answers no because of us restrictions they could not sell devices but something more next years one do not need yet anyway
Huawei,P50 Pro,there will be one yeah yeah
Huawei,P50 Pro,absolute true believe huawei would be able to in best possible shortest time for consumer more yeah good luck with that do huawei even at the top of their domestic smartphone market share
Huawei,P50 Pro,download the google framework and stuff apks and install playstore apk then it should work bit
Huawei,P50 Pro,yes and once huawei is able to create all their own components and software the us would neve more absolute true believe huawei would be able to in best possible shortest time for consumers to enjoy their new possibilities on phones and other products
Huawei,P50 Pro,overacting absolute true
Huawei,P50 Pro,why not
Huawei,P50 Pro,well gmail and twitter idk maybe can install the apk on ur phone to see if twitter is avail more understood but there are other clients like edison mail blue mail outlook its important there are alternatives for average user now im not sure if there are cases where missing gms is currently out of alternatives and the phone de facto doesnt work cause of that certain case
Huawei,P50 Pro,still no google app on this new phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,great smartphone analysing specifications cameras possibilities and have little there to more well gmail and twitter idk maybe can install the apk on ur phone to see if twitter is available but gmail is no no sadly
Huawei,P50 Pro,bravo huawei after so many western country pressure he is to give such good smartphone
Huawei,P50 Pro,looks like thismdevice has only omnivision no exmor
Huawei,P50 Pro,any reasonable workaround to get the playstore running
Huawei,P50 Pro,just wait huawei pro plus there will be one
Huawei,P50 Pro,no
Huawei,P50 Pro,no is not big deal for me since government of my country has no plans to make network reality but missing google services is problem indeed
Huawei,P50 Pro,deleted post no in your house before too
Huawei,P50 Pro,no of country dont have no wifi are joking huawei can absolutely make wi more also charging charging is only released in infinix concept device only and not regular phone and as if isnt lightning fast enough
Huawei,P50 Pro,no no wifi no watts charge years old processor price is high no of country dont have no wifi are joking huawei can absolutely make wifi when it isnt even released year old processor kirin is yr old haha good joke you do realiza its just been one year since the launch of the series plus they have limited stock and like in october november it will go out of stock and sd will be used
Huawei,P50 Pro,how can they both be qm when they are both but not the same resolution different sensor
Huawei,P50 Pro,no really downgrade this for flagship device like seriously is getting adapted fast more because will definitely be available to everyone before fan fact some people got years ago in there houses and am not taking about india or africa
Huawei,P50 Pro,legend reborn they always had best cameras on their phones same gonna be this year new camera king
Huawei,P50 Pro,love you huawei magical
Huawei,P50 Pro,quite sad no googleno phone its as simple as that are you serious
Huawei,P50 Pro,very disgusting design rip huawei
Huawei,P50 Pro,so eur the prices are valid where how much the transport import taxes and what about vat in europe the vat is some applied on top of the starting price import taxes sometimes on top of transport too warranty
Huawei,P50 Pro,im glad some of the manufacturers are finally bringing back the gold models of phones more weve had gold for ages iphone xs and series galaxy and also had it too believe last year
Huawei,P50 Pro,its fun to use mobile without gms highly agreed actually borrowed the huawei mate pro of my big brother and even without gms it rocks and quite of unique experience
Huawei,P50 Pro,huaweifan aug they also need appdevopers to get into appgallery for thats what consumers cares about whe more yea good luck with that
Huawei,P50 Pro,im like comparing this pro to older huawei devices religously kinda prefer the pro more than pro hope they release the pro if it is available the specs in pro seems to be good but feels something lacking
Huawei,P50 Pro,waowww eurosand no nano memory card no google services etcdead on the spot
Huawei,P50 Pro,snapdragonwow
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei cant use tsmc on manufacturing so stock on kirin are very limited and thats why they use chips now snapdragon usa ban china to use model and only they can buy now seen usa media and youtubers to attack huawei to not have in the pro have been fun to see if qualcomm could have stock with chips if they couldnt use tsmc on manufacturing
Huawei,P50 Pro,well it was surprise seeing the rumors about continuous optical zoom where not real after all
Huawei,P50 Pro,who care about gms no one
Huawei,P50 Pro,no no party
Huawei,P50 Pro,my next device dont care about google
Huawei,P50 Pro,liked the addition of color display tried to buy color bit monitor for my pc but their price is so high that become happy with color at first thought color range is the main thing to search and was looking for ntsc or srgb monitor would be better later found color range is nothing main thing is how many color the display support good thing is color display will be available for mid range mobile in future for sure then will get one as cannot afford the pro also
Huawei,P50 Pro,ofc you they and me cant be sure how many people in eu will buy huawei phones but more am definetely agree with you am from indonesia and always love huawei with or without google am big fans of huawei since years ago and will always be have mate mate pro mate pro matebook huawei smartwatch freebuds pro freelace and am looking forward to see the huawei mate pro hopefully they will launch the mate pro this year since heard that they will skip mate pro this year nice to know you bro
Huawei,P50 Pro,why would you need watt charging watt is already really fast overacting
Huawei,P50 Pro,absolutely huawei has leapt through unprepared waters orchestrated by usa bans hopefully the more yes and once huawei is able to create all their own components and software the us would never be able to do anything against huawei or any other chinese phone company as they would just get help from huawei
Huawei,P50 Pro,wow this is the phone am waiting for huawei has done justice to we the customers great ph more absolutely huawei has leapt through unprepared waters orchestrated by usa bans hopefully the company would come back stronger at last
Huawei,P50 Pro,its channel color spectrum sensor not rgbcir or older huaweis channel one getting the colors you see is always hard lot also depends on processing and lens based on presentation it should be pretty close just wish they would include raw option for cameras otherwise sonys raw jack is still the best option
Huawei,P50 Pro,yeah pay sht tone of money for the phone and still get an oled display not even amaled of more yeah you pay ton of money for the phone and you still get an oled screen not even amaled from super amaled you know that amaled loooool super amoled and oled emit the same colors the differences are the layers they have person who does not know the name or the differences of each one will not notice it either or do you think that because it says super is better or fluid amoled is more fluid
Huawei,P50 Pro,why they didnt put their own network on their kirin socs and selling them outside us because has american technology
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei is the best sure
Huawei,P50 Pro,am living in china yesterday experienced the pro in the huawei store the pro has been greatly improved in photography the primary camera uses rggb comos with ois and its reproduction is accurate boc there is only optical zoom but it is better than one by using huaweis latest algorithm it is pity that the us sanctions huawei cant use the rf chips and gms which leads to very poor experience will probably buy huawei to support huawei this may be the last phone for huawei
Huawei,P50 Pro,no but also no google so no huawei you wouldnt believe how many people can live without google go and check out rdegoogle that is prime example
Huawei,P50 Pro,mate pro have std and uwa camera in the front no it doesnt it has an ultrawide camera and tof sensor no standard wide selfie camera for any mate models
Huawei,P50 Pro,the telephoto may have lower focal length but it can head to head with mi ultra let me tell more yes pp can easily provide better at least same picture quality on tele when compare to miu in the initial camera firmware
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei never put an ultrawide selfie camera on their and mate series phones it has only eve more mate pro has ultra wide selfie what do you mean
Huawei,P50 Pro,this phone it nice will be super nice chipsetspeed processors crystal clear camera fast charging
Huawei,P50 Pro,pro camera spec correction based on full frame mm mm mm ovb more ovb mm counted
Huawei,P50 Pro,mp periscope telephoto pdaf ois optical zoom what sensor size you can see my analysis when gsmarena agree it appears in pp comments uploaded the analysis in this chat few minutes ago it seems like ovb by mm or imx monochrome by mm by mm
Huawei,P50 Pro,lovely camera lovely chipset lovely os and the most important lovely price
Huawei,P50 Pro,beast is coming
Huawei,P50 Pro,hope it will cost maybe even since it doesnt have price globally is euro sadly cuz they dont have enough chips for the phone maybe if the kirin stock runs out they will price it bit less since they can buy tons of sd but they will lose profit and gain profit xd
Huawei,P50 Pro,exactly who needs the useless black white camera the monochrome isnt the regular bw sensor think monochrome has more light than regular bayer sensor and more with quad bayer plus it can make contrast and dynamic range outstanding
Huawei,P50 Pro,no in such latest phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,glad to see huawei is back with their flagshipone of the best android devices you can buy cur more ofc you they and me cant be sure how many people in eu will buy huawei phones but im from denmark in scandinavia and for sure will buy phone without google but hope for mate instead always mate for me
Huawei,P50 Pro,you speak for the whole of europe chillmate its fridaypoisoned darts use somewhere elsenot in the moodread my comment againand think about itno im not the spokesman for our continent thats bothering youobviously
Huawei,P50 Pro,no the actual max zoom is trueform dualmatrix camera truechroma shot zoom range zoom range is the maximum zoom ratio divided by ultra wide angle magnification httpsconsumerhuaweicomenphonesppro taken from official website pls check first if you want to speak something it reflect your intelligence
Huawei,P50 Pro,this is more like promoting gimmick time if you calculate from the uw lens lol no the actual max zoom is
Huawei,P50 Pro,the reason they go with lower focal length what get is the longer focal length ex the harder to stabilize image and get good detail to have better quality like the promotional image they need to reduce down the focal length if they go with it will be on par quality like the rest flagship ex mi ultra its like tweaking things to get better advantage this is not new to huawei the quad bayer and monocrohome sensor in pro is one example
Huawei,P50 Pro,from mm periscope telephoto optical zoom pro to mm periscope telepho more this is because their new tech longer focal length will reduce the detail that can be captured if you see their launch video in pro in their telephoto algorithm explanation it seems the lower focal length the better image quality detail that can be captured
Huawei,P50 Pro,under display optical ultrasonic where is it my reno lite has optical at this the same optical is faster
Huawei,P50 Pro,huaweis own harmony os level up beat the other ios and android devices hope youll develop own huawei appgallery like playstore im waiting for the return
Huawei,P50 Pro,finally the most ugly phone was redifined by huawei thats subjective therefore irrelevant what matters is how good the phone performs and im pretty sure it crushes whatever phone you have especially in the camera department
Huawei,P50 Pro,most people in the world dont including me lmao are you from slovenia
Huawei,P50 Pro,keep in mind that unlocking the bootloader for huawei or honor isnt free which means no root nor custom rom without paying
Huawei,P50 Pro,you know that harmony os still runs on android and will therefore include ussoftware chinese more depends on your definition of ussoftware does it include open source software created in usa if so dont see an issue as its the developers intent for it to be utilized to be honest its almost impossible to create new software from scratch itll turnout to be like windows phone where microsoft paid developers to put stuff on their store there just isnt enough incentive for developers to create another app in another operating system but anyways only time will tell if the new os fails like all the others if there isnt enough adoption
Huawei,P50 Pro,idc who jul hope harmony device win the heart of the public dont let us monopoly the world you know that harmony os still runs on android and will therefore include ussoftware chinese propaganda usually isnt very clever if huawei builds software from sketch without using western software it would be breakthrough sadly china still doesnt have companies capable of this also im very sure its not the usa nor the missing androidos that ruins huawei but the cpc people are not dumb and the media elsewhere is not censored the way it is in china north korea or russia
Huawei,P50 Pro,hope harmony device win the heart of the public dont let us monopoly the world
Huawei,P50 Pro,never buying because of huawei mate pro plus
Huawei,P50 Pro,brhhh no pro in this series
Huawei,P50 Pro,yeah got full coverage in my home you dont know your needs if someone into definitely camera as priority over anyday plus if that person live in place where is not mainstream yet why not nothing to loose if your top priority are internet speed ditch this phone from your mine save your money and go get any cheap midrange phone that has
Huawei,P50 Pro,im waiting to see how sd performs with harmony os
Huawei,P50 Pro,to those who say no fail do you have in your house and will you more yeah got full coverage in my home you dont
Huawei,P50 Pro,flagship phones are but it is
Huawei,P50 Pro,lmfao no epic fail this guy must be dumb not every phone has to have to be good
Huawei,P50 Pro,you are right we will not use it before
Huawei,P50 Pro,the snapdragon may have better thermal head room with the exclusion of the modem hope the graphene and huawei software can do better than most devices out there
Huawei,P50 Pro,mi ultra ultra and vivo pro plus finally are gonna get bested in the camera department huawei pro may have better wider selfies better lowlight thanks to monochrome sensor and large main sensor better zoom flexibility thanks to high resolution mp tele that can zoom from to with minimal quality loss allows users to zoom from to lossless with their mp so huawei may allow from to losslessly too maybe an better ultrawide cam dont knoww about the sensor yet but ultrawide king now is still vivo pro plus thanks to the gimbal that allows for night vision ultrawide cam also huaweis image processing is better than xiaomis and samsungs oil paintings look but still behind apple and google in video it does not have and will take iphone and vivo over huawei xiaomi and samsungs video
Huawei,P50 Pro,imagine if pro is only that would be excellent
Huawei,P50 Pro,really wish the camera bump was centered
Huawei,P50 Pro,disappointing not having the expected new camera sensor though this phone has already the first rank on dxomark but still it could abd should has done better rivals are so close besides they have google services which is abig compromise to ignore
Huawei,P50 Pro,im not bias towards any brand yes have my favorite companies but im not hater more its not most people that hate now you think youre special lol only small minority truly hate just dont like the little lens clusters inside the bigger circular housing looks and style are subjective know but much prefer the older huawei design from say pro and have had huawei in the past but im now continuously switching because cant find one feel comfortable with long term
Huawei,P50 Pro,wdym where is it the pro can zoom up to digitally these guys dont post things on how much the zoom and stuff is that will be exagaratted once the phone is realesed this is because there is always bias in every company no one can tell weather its the phone thats zooming in or the software just cropping into the picture so we will hopefully have all information by wend of august
Huawei,P50 Pro,do you guys think they might release pro plus with and video becuse think those are the two main places its lacking but hopefully after further investigation when the phone is realeaces we can examine and see if those two things are even important
Huawei,P50 Pro,dont mind no dont have any coverage where live anyways
Huawei,P50 Pro,excellent camera review
Huawei,P50 Pro,lol dig this design it looks really nice tbh especially the brush gold color love the pink one wish it was available for the though
Huawei,P50 Pro,that is why still love vivos zoom and zoom dual telephoto setup its much more im happy with any if its hi res with great processing even more though its great to have more fovs having one hi res is also good like on my vivo mp is better than some mp shoot with sun behind anyway would be perfect though as second tele
Huawei,P50 Pro,of the comments saying this phone is ugly are anonymous even they know they are wrong lol dig this design it looks really nice tbh especially the brush gold color
Huawei,P50 Pro,hm the pro is worse than the pro no its not
Huawei,P50 Pro,display has hole punched into it no frontfacing stereo speakers no headphone ja more man omg most phones have punch hole or hole in corner and it have stereo speakers learn to read please and jack is useless obsolette wireless is way better and future of technology
Huawei,P50 Pro,looks like best camera phone on the market along with mi ultra rest of the competition and competitors just toying on the sand like usualy
Huawei,P50 Pro,best brand ever huawei my number one
Huawei,P50 Pro,huawei is done on market it is sad
Huawei,P50 Pro,the pro model has zoom and the simple the previous pro models all had something more youll be surprise that optical on pro has continuous zoom with different sensor are far superior it will be better than on vanilla even up to zoom
Huawei,P50 Pro,two issues that see off the bat this phone will most definitely not use the kirin choosers more wrong series is the last with leica branding mate will use someone elses if had to guess most likely zeiss
Huawei,P50 Pro,only optical zoom pro plus have optical zoom so pro is downgrade keep more pro has optical zoom mm pro has mm optics so pro has only longer focal length but its mp to mp thats times difference so digital zoom will be much better
Huawei,P50 Pro,yet if another company did that same horrible design you would slate it it looks hideous im not bias towards any brand yes have my favorite companies but im not hater like most people
Huawei,P50 Pro,absolutely beautiful phone yet if another company did that same horrible design you would slate it it looks hideous
Huawei,P50 Pro,missing why back technology
Huawei,P50 Pro,bad to hear they lead big real development in mobile photography can you please provide us with the reference for this info
Huawei,P50 Pro,useless camera setup wheres the promised sensor periscope camera at zoom more exactly who needs the useless black white camera
Huawei,P50 Pro,pro plus will have completely different camera array going to use new bigger sony imx mp sensor periscope and all
Huawei,P50 Pro,good thing they removed the ultra wide selfie cam the dual pill cutout looks ridiculous also more huawei never put an ultrawide selfie camera on their and mate series phones it has only ever been tof sensor mainly used for facial recognition unlock huawei only ever put an ultrawide selfie camera on their nova series phones
Huawei,P50 Pro,actually use and often having hi res one with brighter lens is actually better than more that is why still love vivos zoom and zoom dual telephoto setup its much more practical than having two telephoto cameras with zoom and much longer zoom
Huawei,P50 Pro,new beast of bloatware
Huawei,P50 Pro,what do you mean
Huawei,P50 Pro,imagine judging phone from its telephoto thats the best way to describe phone in gsm arena eye
Huawei,P50 Pro,camera design be ugly but it will be the king of mobile camera quality guess ahh yes becaise we spend most of our screen time looking at the back of our phones
Huawei,P50 Pro,megapixels dont really matter if the sensors are big that is good point after all megapixel resolution and pixel pitch size correlate to each other the lower the megapixel the bigger the pixel pitch size and vice versa that is why the sony alpha as produce nearly triple the pixel pitch size than the sony alpha ar despite using the same full frame camera sensor
Huawei,P50 Pro,that rear is ugly
Huawei,P50 Pro,there are questionable decisions in this phone however one that doesnt bother me is the battery while small its evident that huawei have confidence in their harmonyos battery efficiency do as well especially as huaweis historically had great battery life with small batteries what does bother me is the camera mainly the main camera and zoom camera if am reading this correct huaweis sticking to their year old camera which is not going to be enough to challenge apple and samsung unless the software is good enough and secondly the zoom camera is direct offspring to the ultras zoom camera again could be bad unless the software is good enough while the benefits for having the lowzoomhighresolution zoom camera are nice to have good video without need to crop from the main camera better stabilization frankly feel that it is not worth the problems such as rapid video deterioration when zooming past and sheer software reliance if you wanted to zoom but at the same time feel that they probably did it for night performance with big sensor for zoom means that it will likely become the most powerful zoomed night images knowing that this is the phones confuses me will they instead run entirely on kirin they cannot use other chips for their counterparts which cements the fact that this phone will likely not be for the masses sadly cannot imagine price tag lower than or even euros im not surprised if they charged even more for the pro it will likely be due to the lack of stock of the handset that will likely make the technological marvels of this phone even more sad
Huawei,P50 Pro,deleted post who cares as long as photos taken with it look good
Huawei,P50 Pro,why did they downgrade the periscope telephoto from pro to kinda disappointing not necessarily the new sensor capture much more detail so it will be available to zoom digitally more but yeah am disappointed too we should wait till tomorrow though those specs might not be right
Huawei,P50 Pro,similar like huawei mate series
Huawei,P50 Pro,overall would be good be phone
Huawei,P50 Pro,periscope telephoto wonder if this is the case but we will learn everything tomorrow
Huawei,P50 Pro,is hz touch sampling rate true
Huawei,P50,you never even owned the device opinion rejected my family member has it and its worki more shitty especially if you are one inclined to google apps
Huawei,P50,the is it still good phone to buy in
Huawei,P50,like your name you commited sin you got him good
Huawei,P50,thats truly terrible advice snapdragon gen is also bad chip that overheats and more you never even owned the device opinion rejected my family member has it and its working great
Huawei,P50,which mobile do you have bought the phone in may can say am happy it heats up and jam right now as am speaking it just went off
Huawei,P50,nah there aint anything weird bout that look at spec there isnt anything special othe more do you still stand with your words
Huawei,P50,the phone must be nice but no google
Huawei,P50,sure instead of sending and selling personal data to google its going all going directly to more all governments including china usa etc and big companies including google apple samsung huawei etc are stealing customer information thats the way they achieve their goals the problem arises when one doesnt share the profit with governments
Huawei,P50,why you spreading propaganda against huawei huawei have fight for their users againts google more sure instead of sending and selling personal data to google its going all going directly to huawei and the chinese government instead nice
Huawei,P50,as bad as huawei is think xiaomi is still worse the xiaomi brand smartphone are full of more like your name you commited sin
Huawei,P50,when it comes to camera huawei is leading technology leica is more advanced than others camera technology
Huawei,P50,my wife using huawei nova not google play store she already familiar using that phone so bye bye google
Huawei,P50,cant access company portal
Huawei,P50E,wish huawei made with design but with punch hole camera
Huawei,P50E,hope that google services would be back to huawei phones have prime and it has go more have the same feelings with youi do agree with you kirin chip is very good and the quantity of huaweis mobile phone is also very good
Huawei,P50E,this pe is quite decent but in globel version is dont know if kind tempting to buy or not more the majority of the applications that dont work have alternatives couldnt use my banking app to pay with my phone installed curve never looked back and using wwwgooglecom is not restricted in huawei phones
Huawei,P50E,its more like if they werent having huge market share to make america scared of more us dont play fair if they see some non us company gaining market share they instantly make public propaganda to damage its image or bansanction them us no
Huawei,P50E,can presume that this is lite but its got an for expensive
Huawei,P50E,bomai apr whats the future of harmonyos harmony os is currently chinaonly just handful of devices were released with harmony os outside of china so if you dont live in china you dont need to thinking about it but can tell you that harmony os is wonderful
Huawei,P50E,for snap mah for display what think huawei with more what is the matter galaxy has same cpu and costs the screen has less resolution and the camera is not even close to the camera in the pe so you would prefer just because it costs less and has mah more battery capacitiy these are arguments you make when comparing entry level phones the huawei pe is premium phone actually it is the same as vanilla but with less powerful cpu
Huawei,P50E,flat screencheck decent chipcheck capable camerascheck nice design and premium materials more still waiting for series with kirin chipsets and zoom for both photo and video capabilities and hope fully they will release it with lcd screen
Huawei,P50E,which phone that know have ip sd optical zoom oled ppi sd card mm di more even mi ultra doesnt have type but this one had it even cheap tablet like legion had it
Huawei,P50E,whats the future of harmonyos
Huawei,P50E,tbh all im seeing is nova with ps design does the nova have periscope
Huawei,P50E,less price for almost the same specs as vanilla huawei that is insane and oh the processor doesnt heat up as much
Huawei,P50E,and where would you use anyway when you walk past the very center of your city availab more well said absolutely see no reason to get hyped over when there is no working infrastructure in the first place
Huawei,P50E,its nice to see huawei creating mid ranger with optical zoom and screen with higher screen resolution than samsung for example threw away the telephoto lens from the in the
Huawei,P50E,ok am using nova for the past months have had no problem with gms or but the only complaint have here is that dont receive the notifications on my phone for skype fiverr bitrix and some other apps as well the only issue need them to resolve is to get notifications dont mind no for another year or but fix this issue
Huawei,P50E,use in my
Huawei,P50E,euros with no connectivity ill have to pass and where would you use anyway when you walk past the very center of your city availability is still poor because of its problematic nature people need to stop pretending you cant use phone without and downloading an app in seconds instead of why would it matter
Huawei,P50E,overpriced garbage with small battery no thanks maybe learn what overpriced means
Huawei,P50E,this would be rival for samsung galaxy as
Huawei,P50E,why xiaomi doesnt make phone like that mp pericsope maybe in
Huawei,P50E,this phone isnt too bad
Huawei,P50E,better use the lowest chipset if alang design
Huawei,P60 Art,for the love of god why cant delete my own comments
Huawei,P60 Art,the best looking phone ever
Huawei,P60 Art,wow this phone is even uglier than the rest of huawei lineup which were already ugly which ones are ugly
Huawei,P60 Art,its not more billion oh yes billion
Huawei,P60 Art,in the end of the day it is up to your personal preference some people may like the design more its not more billion
Huawei,P60 Art,yes but the chinese global version is not so good and you can find lot of programs you canno more wellyeah
Huawei,P60 Art,yes it is possible just you need to import directly from china yes but the chinese global version is not so good and you can find lot of programs you cannot remove and if you buy it directly near your home you will also have years of warranty when you order from china you have only days of warranty
Huawei,P60 Art,beautiful this may yet be the ugliest phone on the planet that amorphous camera island is more in the end of the day it is up to your personal preference some people may like the design of this phone like me whereas others like you may not like it bro there are over billion people living currently in the earth it is not possible when everyone likes one thing it is impossible for example like pepsi rather than coca cola but this doesnt mean that everyone should like pepsi due to the fact that like it
Huawei,P60 Art,just look closer to the back of the phone and you will understand why they choose to give the more yes
Huawei,P60 Art,google is spying on you too nothing is safe on the internet yes you are completely right
Huawei,P60 Art,siliconcarbon performance better in theory yes
Huawei,P60 Art,ugly phone with no google service useless pointless less less less to some people huawei phones are essential but to other people its not some people may like the design language of huawei phones some may not its just up to your personal preference personally use the huawei phone for my main phone and it is great have used the iphone pro max and galaxy ultra for my main phone in the past and in my experience dont want to go back to iphone or galaxy in this world there are people who doesnt like huawei phones like you whereas people like me loves huawei phones the thing you need to do is to just accept the truth because this is just personal preference admit it
Huawei,P60 Art,huawei art is incomparable with nokia in terms of beauty and aesthetic design
Huawei,P60 Art,no nokia model can come close to huawei art in ugliness department because nokia is the only ugliest phone and huawei is most beautiful and luxery phone in worldthats why it cant come close
Huawei,P60 Art,ok go and buy ugly nokia no nokia model can come close to huawei art in ugliness department
Huawei,P60 Art,beautiful phone bought it last week and was ecstatic when it arrived it allowed me to play cod with perfect frames so you can imagine how fast the cellphone is
Huawei,P60 Art,gooooooood phone ugly phone with no google service useless pointless less less less
Huawei,P60 Art,gooooooood phone
Huawei,P60 Art,well guess that is new piece of tech that will be used on phones but is silicon carbon bat more agree thats the big question and time will tell of course however they would have tested the product as its tech has been around for many years and they would not want to have bad feedback later on and have their product attract bad report when they are attempting to break into the big names market silicone is being usedtested with lithium by tesla and few other ev battery manufacturers for their new ev batteries and it is also used in other battery forms also
Huawei,P60 Art,new and huaweihonor are one of the first to use itthis phone is on my short list well guess that is new piece of tech that will be used on phones but is silicon carbon battery durable tho
Huawei,P60 Art,is this kind of battery was used in other phone brands in the past or is this brand new thing new and huaweihonor are one of the first to use itthis phone is on my short list
Huawei,P60 Art,quote this sitea siliconcarbon battery is more energy dense than typical lithi more is this kind of battery was used in other phone brands in the past or is this brand new thing
Huawei,P60 Art,can someone tell me what is that silicon carbon battery can do to device like this quote this sitea siliconcarbon battery is more energy dense than typical lithium battery of the same size
Huawei,P60 Art,nice phone but not available globally
Huawei,P60 Art,we went esim like and your last update must have esim
Huawei,P60 Art,only if huawei was not spying for the chinese governmentthey could have been the number one more yeah prefer usa spying on me had been spying since the birth of the internet worlwide they even caught be pooping in the bathroom one time
Huawei,P60 Art,it is just me or not because when look at this phone can imagine whale and do not know if will like it or not
Huawei,P60 Art,looks like somebody stuck fish on the camera bump of pro and called it art
Huawei,P60 Art,im confused isnt valerian family of plants mean the movie httpsmimdbcomtitlett
Huawei,P60 Art,there is certainly nothing arty about this phone just look at that camera bump just look closer to the back of the phone and you will understand why they choose to give the phone this name
Huawei,P60 Art,im waiting for huawei drawing
Huawei,P60 Art,or maybe valerian edition im confused isnt valerian family of plants
Huawei,P60 Art,wow at last matching camera resolutions just hope the sensors are or at least because otherwise and that they are not quadbayer can you imagine buying mp ful frame sony camera only to discover that its actual resolution is only mp because like almost all samsung apples huaweis oppo etc cameras it is quad bayer and so quarter of the resolution you have paid for and we at least need to see and obtain from reviwers on gsm arena downloadable raw dng files from these cameras because dpreview is closing and their phone reviews which do include them will no longer even occur at all on paper this looks like the final solution that you will at last be able to travel with just your phone blog with just your phone etc we do need hope for viable future
Huawei,P60 Art,the time for change has come the best looking smartphone ever apart of that huawei is famou more only if huawei was not spying for the chinese governmentthey could have been the number one brand in the world
Huawei,P60 Art,huawei avatar flow edition or maybe valerian edition
Huawei,P60 Art,how come the latest flagship device does not support is that true didnt you know about the ban on huawei from us
Huawei,P60 Art,the specs doesnt seem show no google play services does it mean it has google play
Huawei,P60 Art,im thinking that why the all series have only
Huawei,P60 Art,huawei was banned from using and google services
Huawei,P60 Art,hmmm its too long avatar the way of water either avatar edition or the more huawei avatar flow edition
Huawei,P60 Art,huawei trying to bring ancient design back but now we are living in symmetrical world you sure enjoy living inside the box
Huawei,P60 Art,man what is with that camera bump
Huawei,P60 Art,this should rather be called the way of water or somethin avatar edition
Huawei,P60 Art,please this is ugly
Huawei,P60 Art,its like sloths
Huawei,P60 Art,that has to be the weirdest but nicest looking camera island ive ever seen
Huawei,P60 Art,beautiful design well done huawei
Huawei,P60 Art,unique design
Huawei,P60 Pro,with time they are eliminating some specs and possibilities in huawei apps like changing display bit rate and so on some photos are getting bluish since last updates
Huawei,P60 Pro,bit expensive its very expensive even with that hardware no acceptable and no more use microg and aurora store no issues
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei pro price in india was expected to be rs this is gb ram gb internal storage base variant of huawei pro which was expected to available in black green rococo pearl violet colourthe inch quadcurve ltpo screen gives you smooth grip and immersive view with its hz adaptive refresh rate the huawei xtruetm display provides accurate colours and truetolife details in bright and dark areas supporting wide colour gamut it has gained tv rheinland colour accuracy dual certification colour accuracy precise colour projection
Huawei,P60 Pro,after five generations of pro series to this date they cannot reproduce cool green color al more with the update this this problem is solved
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei pro is the worst phone someone can own worst material ever even though it looks amazing and so durable when you buy it software issues when you download anything on the phone have not been able to download many apps that are required from my work do not ever by this phone its the worst mistake ever
Huawei,P60 Pro,can tell me which has the best total optical zoom best total digital zoom also the supe more the new one is the best one but comparing pro and pro with basic is totally wrong pro and pro killed it
Huawei,P60 Pro,very interesting camera spec of the pro is the effective diameter of its periscope camer more can tell me which has the best total optical zoom best total digital zoom also the super slomo as iam going to buy either the hua wei ppro plus ppro or perhaps this pro since you know about zoom
Huawei,P60 Pro,hate washington officials so much
Huawei,P60 Pro,wonderful stills just discovered lately problem is best stills always come with big bump camera sensor among other problems which dont want im not photographer bet id better have real dslr than this piece of sht in the end
Huawei,P60 Pro,checking the sample photos they are excellent ultrawide stunning with truetolife details at crop main camera night mode
Huawei,P60 Pro,second hand market pricing has to do with volume samsung has high volume and low desirability more thats why the americains are buying iphones produced inchina
Huawei,P60 Pro,the periscope camera hardware could benefit from smaller pixels if the lens is sharp this periscope lens has the largest effective lens diameter on the market mm so it would really make sense to combine it with micrometer pixels instead of
Huawei,P60 Pro,verdict after using the pro for months coming from google pro plus you wouldnt go back to normal charging again after using quick charge battery life is phenomenal compared to xiaomi note pro pp iphone pro max camera is as good as the iphone pro and it takes better closeup photos than ip pro there is no heating issue compared to the pp phone unlock works unlike googles phone emui is as smooth as andriod cellular and wifi signal better than pp use gbox to access gms or install mircog gfs with aurora store to get your googles app am glad to buy this phone as replacement for the google pro the latter had caused my so much misery to my life
Huawei,P60 Pro,please explain because my whatsapp doesnt back up to anything the reason why say so more that is because you need to install davx and google drive where wathsapp store and download backups do search in google or youtube and it is not very hard to get it working saw many videos show how to do it but never did myself as not have huawei now getting one soon again
Huawei,P60 Pro,cheaper and better than the iphone according to dxomark the most used google apps are supported therefore no reason to ban this device
Huawei,P60 Pro,design is good is think except that big camera on back side two big problems it has no goog more well often see these sell for euro in operator stores with vouchers for watches aswell so price can be problem but only if we are talking about msrp and not what the phones actually go around for
Huawei,P60 Pro,sure and messages backup on the cloud please explain because my whatsapp doesnt back up to anything the reason why say so ive got new huawei and when downloaded my whatsapp again it was blank lost all my chats where it had normally gave me an option to backup and now it doesnt must say love the new huawei pro really but really hope they can make whatsapp compatible with huawei and give us an option to back up our whatsapp really please sort it out will be helpful please look into it
Huawei,P60 Pro,the phone doesnt have playstore or findora its struggle to download apps using gbox or huawei app sometimes these apps are not useless after downloading they dont download sometimes one needs to go google search the app then download it sometimes that works sometimes it doesnt then its got keypad problem it dials what it wants especially in the middle of phone call it goes and dial another phone number and put the main phone call on hold and go press other apps goes as far as hanging up calls when it wants the camera is satisfactry whn its video call im so unhappy with the phone its got lot of problems the excitement had when buying it turned into regret
Huawei,P60 Pro,when will be released globally waiting for it
Huawei,P60 Pro,does the phone support whatsapp sure and messages backup on the cloud
Huawei,P60 Pro,just cant understand by the fact that there are so so many people recognizing that this phone is using the snapdragon gen people this phone is using the snapdragon plus gen those processors are very different from each other the plus gen is the upgraded and cooled version of the gen gen is based on samsung nm architecture while the plus gen is based on tsmc nm architecture
Huawei,P60 Pro,no extra detail in photos versus huawei so the hype
Huawei,P60 Pro,snapdragon gen hard avoid no matter how good the rest of the phone is that cpu is some more it is using snapdragon plus gen which is lot better then exynos and snapdragon gen
Huawei,P60 Pro,be aware that the phone cant use lighthouse even with location set up in malaysia huawei will be no go until the lighthouse become available outside malaysia apps like gboard second space etc are not enough summary display great camera awesome variable aperture is the gamechanger every bigger sensor should have this it was enough blurry pictures battery and still of battery left
Huawei,P60 Pro,really wanted to buy this one but its software is just horrendous not because it doesnt have google but lot of its simple stuff like searching an app requires some permission and internet connectivity and those bunch of ads called recommendation youll have to disable manually in some cases cannot be disabled completely it doesnt even have simple video player or music player itll direct you to their streaming apps and compare to other uis their emuis seems so cluttered comparable to those in tecno etc themes doesnt help either most of the available themes are so tacky some of this may be regional problem but these are the problem with my huawei few months ago until decided to get replacement as secondary phone
Huawei,P60 Pro,samsung handsets price tend to do that not huawei kindly checkout device like the huawei more second hand market pricing has to do with volume samsung has high volume and low desirability so price crash apple has high volume and high desirability so price somewhat stays huawei has no volume so pricing will remain stubbornly high huawei is for patriots to china back when the ban was announced officials were rushing to buy to show loyalty to the party the founder has very deep ties with the party elites
Huawei,P60 Pro,bulbulitobayagbag may also handsets from huawei tend to depreciate in value very fast lot of people seem to over more samsung handsets price tend to do that not huawei kindly checkout device like the huawei pro four years old and still expensive to get but the plus is only yrs old and is now very cheap huawei just rules together with apple and huaweis aim is to take down apple interms of tech and innovation just ask usa
Huawei,P60 Pro,no no google services eur lol lmao even also handsets from huawei tend to depreciate in value very fast lot of people seem to overlook that thats why people tend to gravitate toward the iphone if you decide to sell your device later on at least with an iphone you can still sell it at much better price than huawei
Huawei,P60 Pro,you been invested in googles ecosystem has nothing to do with this phone same applies to appl more they have plenty of apps just not in your language
Huawei,P60 Pro,gmail drivephotos youtube wallet dont tell me that could just use alternati more you been invested in googles ecosystem has nothing to do with this phone same applies to apple however the lack of apps in huawei appstore might be an issue and that deserves consideration in the review
Huawei,P60 Pro,honestly dont get the fuss about google understand partly in country like denmark there is mandatory government app that needs google play store to function silly know so from that perspective its turn off otherwise than that its quite easy to live without that framework
Huawei,P60 Pro,surprised that this reviewer uses mediocre to describe flagship phone more can please kindly tell me whether the huawei pro plus is still in china available brand new in box not second hand and please tell me which hua wei phone is better than the optical zoom digital zoom of the pro plus as im planning to get one one day
Huawei,P60 Pro,the ultrawide pics are really good both daylight night time but lack of is really deal breaker for me that why still keeping mate pro around
Huawei,P60 Pro,what is so essential about google that you couldnt live without does your old phone wor more gmail drivephotos youtube wallet dont tell me that could just use alternative apps or crappier web apps im too invested in googles ecosystem at this point because it just works so well
Huawei,P60 Pro,no google is ok because there are alternative bypass but no is suicide because there are not alternative to connect to network
Huawei,P60 Pro,actually dont like the sound quality in the video clips kbps is too low and don more your headphones and earphones will fail you well before any bitrate will no smartphone will ever match dedicated microphone the pro wont either
Huawei,P60 Pro,larger display is not an advantage stated when compared to honor magic stop saying that we want smaller screen phones and pro is already too big
Huawei,P60 Pro,the achieved magnification and quality are quite impressive given the limitation of the sensor and its lens limitation of the lens it has larger effective lens diameter than the ultra mm whereas the ultras periscope only has this means that regarding diffraction huaweis periscope could let you zoom more than the ultra at the same quality if huaweis periscope had smaller pixels slightly smaller than micrometer
Huawei,P60 Pro,lets look at the zoomed photos now surprisingly we found those to be more detailed than the zoomed images taken on the huawei mate pro which used mp camera with similar lens similar lens what are you talking about the mate pro likely had the same periscope lens as the pro mm lens so the effective lens diameter was only mm and the camera suffered from diffraction due to pixel size fnumber micrometer ratio of only the pros periscope has an effective lens diameter of mm this means that distant objects suffer less from diffraction and this compensates for the lower megapixel count at least slightly it could be also possible that huawei uses better demosaicing algorithm or that quad ryb sensor produces maybe sharper results than quad bayer sensor or that the lens is of higher quality
Huawei,P60 Pro,did use gspace about years ago and it was horrible didnt think that the day will come that theysimilar apps get this close to real google services mean even on some phones that that did have google services we sometimes have problem with hdr on some apps and this not official one is getting the job done in mho lack of and esim isnt still big issue for most of people but the thing is that this is the same price as others while they have these its not drawback for me but its very good reason to not buy it
Huawei,P60 Pro,the telephoto camera on the huawei pro has mm lens meaning it offers the largest aperture on such long telephoto camera thats wrong mm is not specification of the lens but specification for the field of view which also depends on the sensor size its actually mm lens and it has large effective lens diameter because mm mm is one of the largest effective lens diameters you can get in smartphone including main cameras only the galaxy zoom has slightly more mm this means that it can capture more light per exposure time from distant objects than any smartphone camera including main camera on the market
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei literally has the phd in camera department im impressed by the results
Huawei,P60 Pro,deleted post sorry iphone design bro check your vision at doctor you even said it yourself curved screen does the iphone have that and the edges are again curved not like on the iphoneflat
Huawei,P60 Pro,quadbayer ryyb sounds confusing know quad bayer know ryyb but nomenclature fusing the two together definitely suggests more than one potential meaning and we lack an illustration the telemacro issimply the correct way to do things interesting that huawei seems the first to turn things around while they were the first to mislead most of the industry into uwa macros which are pain to use is nearly stop faster than sonys with largely comparable sensor size but then againsigh sony itself is the outlier frankly with the multi aspect penalty dont think its flagship worthy the dof of the samples do seem very shallow but then its absolutely crucial to disclose the focus distance dont agree that this is mature processing perhaps just the colors but details still look waxy magnified well as typical series would for years they do look good without magnification but then so do samsungs and dont abide by that approach again if youre aiming for mp dont pretend you do mp and im certain different person shot the samples compared to the usual reviews many subjects are the same but theyre shot at notably different angles and positions making them useless for comparison if you want to convince you need real shootout think still see quite some distortion in those uwa imagesyet you wont even shoot brick wall its uwa you need brick wall if you want to say something about distortion night mode seems to progress with an even stronger emphasis on the overall picture instead of the pixels theres little if any improvement at all if magnified but the image at size on my screen seems notably better than before again thats about mp on my screen but its probably enough for most nonpro use but its definitely not real pro approach and again we need real shootout dont think theres been one for the past years
Huawei,P60 Pro,everything else will drain your battery noticeably faster if aod drains battery noticeably faster than most likely the screen is inefficient which almost certainly means that drr doesnt work as advertised these should refresh in hz after all it turns your phone into listening device that streams the sound to your bluetooth headphones or speaker funny how hearing aid with the receiver detached from the speaker turns into spying device xd and we had no say in this there is just no option to tell that this is not junk it was gone forever lol and thought vivo was overly assertive certain chinese companies may have taken on undesirable traits of their party branches and for the record wechat binds the voicetotext language to the chosen app languagepreviously only the system language so for communications app with over decades history and over billion users they cannot even accommodate bilingual usage not to mention trilingual or above and with the abundant underutilized power of todays ai cores in socs they still refuse to support offline conversion be it translation or voicetext conversion this is what can only describe as authoritarian arrogance
Huawei,P60 Pro,android and last years chipset this has to be the lamest launch ever disappointment the photos look great though
Huawei,P60 Pro,very bad mp photos in photo compare tool
Huawei,P60 Pro,the finish looks interesting but the camera island looks toyish
Huawei,P60 Pro,well this seems like pretty good phone checked all the camera samples and it does perform better than the competition in many scenarios the natural rendition of colours with plenty of resolved details and minimal noise this is what all smartphone companies should provide no gms and no is deal breaker for me but other than that this seems like solid camera phone
Huawei,P60 Pro,another phone that with smaller camera does better than samsung
Huawei,P60 Pro,im impressed with the photos the flower shot at looks so realistic the night mode also impress me with less noise reduction than the normal mode especially at zoom but really what sold me to this phone was the screen never liked the mate pros massive curve so its great to see huawei noticeably toned it down for this phone its still not truly flat unlike the vanilla mate but its close enough
Huawei,P60 Pro,will wait for honor magic pro probably an huawei phone with gms and or should consi more depends where youre located and if you need the full google services or not personally pro overall would be my choice just got slightly better features want for camera imo id go huawei main sensor and selfie always been the best and somehow still are make iphone and su look average honor magic pro is probably best for secure unlock choices dedicated biometric sensor and ultrasonic fingerprint really just look at which one you can get slightly cheaper and easier for you to get because all are amazing wouldnt wait for the magic pro wont be here till next year the optical zoom cams will do without issue or any real quality degradation you really dont need an average quality times one like with samsung
Huawei,P60 Pro,no google support officially more expensive than gen
Huawei,P60 Pro,funny huawei fans on weibo claiming this phone has same sensor tech of new xperia just because both output mp and area used are similar they claim huawei is not allowed to say huawei is not even spending cash on imxy nor long periscope let alone on something that costs way more
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei says this lens can capture the largest amount of light in the industry for mm lens it actually captures more light per time from distant objects than any smartphone camera including main camera on the market due to the large mm effective lens diameter only the samsung galaxy zoom offers more mm
Huawei,P60 Pro,would be fair
Huawei,P60 Pro,with large pixels thats unusual is there source
Huawei,P60 Pro,no and officially no google services means no go in europe
Huawei,P60 Pro,anyone that have this phone hows the performance is it still worth it to get im more have the chinese version with harmony os overall is quite good camera is excelent baterylife is good minor hicups using it in and most annoying for me is lack of haptic feedback on navigation buttonsneed to use rd party buttons if you want vibration if you can find ot around euro think its worth it
Huawei,P60 Pro,so this the last phone in the series rip will kind of miss it my first phone was lite
Huawei,P60 Pro,at last sb answered thanks lot how is the signal reception of pro what do you think it gets up to signal but my opinion is that is very fast network for internet
Huawei,P60 Pro,hey there got the phone just few weeks ago and must say its great device if you dont more at last sb answered thanks lot how is the signal reception of pro what do you think
Huawei,P60 Pro,recent opinion about the phone anyone hey there got the phone just few weeks ago and must say its great device if you dont mind some deficiencies upgraded from pixel pro and it feels lot snappier smoother animations and camera is lot more consistent overall great phone with the roccoco pearl just looking amazing missing google play services isnt major issue since you can get of apps to work with the microg workaround gpay and mcdonalds are the only ones so far refusing to work if you love taking photos then this phone is almost definitely for you
Huawei,P60 Pro,hi all bought this phone several months ago and its over all good for the price cam more the stronger the glass the more prone it is to scratches
Huawei,P60 Pro,they should just leave the snapdragon chip and produce their own usa just weaponising their more what do you mean snapdragon is weaponized
Huawei,P60 Pro,not anymore why not
Huawei,P60 Pro,have galaxy watch but its not compatible with this phone tt someone help me
Huawei,P60 Pro,xiaomi and pro are price same in my country im confused which one to get if you can overlook the minor gms problems then definitely go for pro
Huawei,P60 Pro,hisilicon kirin chip is far better than snapdragon chip perfomance wise not about fame
Huawei,P60 Pro,dont need gbox to run google servicesu can instal micro and do some setup and all google more yes microg is mich bettera option
Huawei,P60 Pro,bro you just wrote what we see on this page is this an advert
Huawei,P60 Pro,life without google is better safer and more personal privacy you only need the maps progra more dont need gbox to run google servicesu can instal micro and do some setup and all google stuff will run
Huawei,P60 Pro,that cpu is surprisingly strong as thought huwaei would have horrible cpus but here we are more did you get new phone
Huawei,P60 Pro,im still using my huawei plite and its going to be about year in about months time an more dude leave site this is about pro not lite cheapest phone the camera on you phone is terrable because it is cheap mobile how can you ever compare to other flag ship turn off internet and leave
Huawei,P60 Pro,the last update in huawei pro and camera interface with limitations errors weird sliding destroyed everything
Huawei,P60 Pro,my huawei plite is years old and still is in perfect condition like first daythe cheape more im still using my huawei plite and its going to be about year in about months time and it is still like new although have changed the battery once what really lime most is its cabability of zooming of up to while taking photos even when recording videos and handful of my friends that the qualities are sharp can tell me more about your maximum zoom for both
Huawei,P60 Pro,hahap series there is no fps superduper slowmotion only ppro ppro and mate more am still waiting for huawei to release another huawei ppro plus with its optical and digital zoom and also itafps and if there isnt after ppro plus then will have to look for new hua wei pro plus
Huawei,P60 Pro,as huawei user living without google more better bcoz you cant let google know your privacy already years using huawei without google
Huawei,P60 Pro,since its now confirmed that the global pura models only have is this worth picking up over one of them
Huawei,P60 Pro,its just works fire up few apps installed and rocking yeah life without ggle is possible big time
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei phones were always good but dont know how to express how angry am with more and you forgot to drop the name of your cheap phone so we can roast its other aspects like the trash camera xd
Huawei,P60 Pro,use aurora store gbox and gspace but if huawei goes global with their own os will dump more have you tried using mail it is thunderbird for android install directly from apkpure or appgallery have matepad and changed outlook for this other option the interface is the closest to gmail
Huawei,P60 Pro,sadly no google huawei makes best and most stylish smartphones in the market since more use aurora store gbox and gspace but if huawei goes global with their own os will dump most google products most because email takes time to sort out
Huawei,P60 Pro,what is wrong with you ugly ass ufo phones with plastic and garbage software and why would the more they didnt pay usa saved them huawei was about to be number in but trump interfered with sanctions besides true android users know how to get around lack of gms
Huawei,P60 Pro,screen is amazing and the phone is very fast battery lasts days camera has no competition more no no google service company is dieing
Huawei,P60 Pro,the rococo pearl model is beautiful in the way it catches the light and the subtle curves to all sides makes for device thats treat to hold
Huawei,P60 Pro,no unfortunately series will support
Huawei,P60 Pro,theres gbox where you can dowload google apps
Huawei,P60 Pro,so which maximum zoom is better is it the one on the ppro plus or pro so can th more it can beat ultra so it probably beat pro plus
Huawei,P60 Pro,had the pro for around months now love almost everything about it except one thing whe more so which maximum zoom is better is it the one on the ppro plus or pro so can the maximum zoom beat the ppro plus optical zoom digitzal zoom
Huawei,P60 Pro,pro still the best correct
Huawei,P60 Pro,would suggest to upgrade with and giveaway the to me please good way to begging
Huawei,P60 Pro,work in my citys townhall and was informed cannot take the phone with me even if it more where do you live because this situation is going to be hilariously funny if you say usa httpswwwandroidauthoritycomapplegooglepushnotificationsurveillance
Huawei,P60 Pro,hello is it worth to upgrade from huawei pro to huawei pro or better wait for pro more lets wait the pro
Huawei,P60 Pro,it depends if you have any issues with your pro think the biggest selling point of more the pro recieved the kirin only in china on the global market it has the snapdragon
Huawei,P60 Pro,its better to wait for the series the difference between pro and pro is minor yes this is the best to do and think it will be much better than the mate pro which is already very good
Huawei,P60 Pro,need new phone can anyone buy that for me
Huawei,P60 Pro,will it recieve the kirin perhaps down the road but at this rate dont think so there was list of huawei devices that received bluetooth certification while back but that list didnt include version of the pro also with how many orders there are for kirin devices and workers already working overtime dont think it would be very good idea to introduce more kirin devices at this time maybe the supply issues will clear up by in time for kirinpowered release
Huawei,P60 Pro,unfortunately as much as would love to see huawei include newer version of android alongs more thanks for the info guess will just have to use android until my phone becomes obselete usually change every years so hopefully android still works then
Huawei,P60 Pro,because it is the as offers decent mp camera with ois not as good as the huwaei but stil more none of samsungs flagship beyond contain micro sd slot huaweis nano memory and the headphone jack stopped being offered after the stop using samsungs midrange trash that are also getting their jacks and sd slots taken away
Huawei,P60 Pro,google is stealing data from you does it matter theyre just doing it to give you personalized ads so ofc not
Huawei,P60 Pro,btw if we buy pro from china can you install gbox and youtube and stuff or for the china more gbox works on the china version as far as im aware however prefer to use aurora store as dont need to sign in with google account and most apps work fine without gbox aurora store just downloads using links directly from google play using your account if you choose to log in or using public account if you choose anonymous if you are interested in using aurora store to anonymously download apps from the play store this is the flow personally use you will need to download and install aurora store from their github and firefox other browsers might work too but this is the first tried and it worked the default browser will not work for this as far as know set up aurora store to work anonymously make sure you give aurora store all the permissions it needs the only tricky permission is to allow it to open links for this you will have to add it manually under unverified links also recommend going to spoof manager and changing the spoof device to google pixel tablet more on this in the first additional comment start aurora store and let it request session for you go to the play store and search for your app or search for the play store page directly from search engine one way or another get to the play store page for the app youre looking for open the firefox menu and press open in another app if things are set up properly it should open up the aurora store page for the app and you can download install it there some notes additional notes the cpu uses arm cores so for apps where there are different versions for different cpus like firefox the apks you are looking for are the armva ones as result some apps might not install properly in aurora store off the bat in my case couldnt update firefox if you open the aurora store menu and go to spoof manager you will see it defaults to hwmnadefault have so far had no issues after switching to google pixel tablet spoof google pixel spoof might also work since it also only supports armva apks if it looks all broken when opening play store page in aurora store it could be that you need new session just restart the aurora store app and try opening the play store page in aurora store again if you use other app stores like qooapp they will give you warning saying the app may not work properly without google services and it will try to get you to install google services it will then try to get you to install google services but wouldnt recommend it the apps will work just fine without google services and ive heard its pain because you cant force the service off so you cant update it use aurora store anonymously but you can also sign in with your own google account if you do this you probably will have no issues searching for apps directly within aurora store itself so you dont need to install browser via apk
Huawei,P60 Pro,well think it is nice cell phone because huawei is trying there best to make good phones although they are banned from the us
Huawei,P60 Pro,wait the huawei pro doesnt support video recording thats absolutely hilario more videos are so sluggish really dont recommend using an video setting on your phone plus it really takes so much space so huawei do not need an phone video resolution
Huawei,P60 Pro,no network
Huawei,P60 Pro,was just very hoping that huawei can find solution with their heating problems on the snap more yes lets wait and see
Huawei,P60 Pro,it seems its their own was just very hoping that huawei can find solution with their heating problems on the snapdragon chipsets
Huawei,P60 Pro,have and am still using emui yes but see security updates almost every month
Huawei,P60 Pro,actually you could see the sensors on nanoreview it states there that the huawei pro main more interesting the sensors from sony are very good
Huawei,P60 Pro,the snapdragon gen is much more capable than the gen but still huawei has still issues more can understand that but they should find solution assume they will not update it with gen processor
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei dont want to tell what camera sensors are on the phone they keep it secret so why spe more it seems its their own
Huawei,P60 Pro,its very good phone but the snapdragon gen is trash the phone is heating lot more the snapdragon gen is much more capable than the gen but still huawei has still issues on trying to manage heat on snapdragon processors when it comes to camera many people are having heating problems when using their huawei phones specially with the snapdragon ones huawei explanation on the pro heating issues when camera is being use is that when using the camera the processor works extra hard on processing image and video quality that is why the processor is beginning to heat up that explanation is fairly enough to satisfy me
Huawei,P60 Pro,wow no charger in the box really like iphone yes they do not have chargers in the box which is nuts come on chargers are part of phone removing it is like you are trying to remove the ability to sleep on human beings
Huawei,P60 Pro,you can ask sleepy joe and trump on the question why huawei cannot use kirin chipset or more yes but do you think they will reply
Huawei,P60 Pro,if anybody wonder why is huawei using cropped part of sensors obviously to have good edge to edge sharpness even with poor lens quality in mobile phone worldby full size cameras as standard they can get stable performance huawei ahead of everyone
Huawei,P60 Pro,oh noes not my jewgle services how will cope oh noes not my brainfrying how will cope
Huawei,P60 Pro,unfortunately it is to be fair the google pixel phone is actually not that bad it had good camera and good software almost comparable with stock android but what is bad about the google pixel phones specially for the phones that have the google tensor chips on is that their heat management is just and lets not forget that pixel phones have slow charging and they do not have charger on the box
Huawei,P60 Pro,nah it should be new kirin you can ask sleepy joe and trump on the question why huawei cannot use kirin chipset or the latest snapdragon chipset
Huawei,P60 Pro,its kindly not unfortunately it is
Huawei,P60 Pro,it should have been snap gen instead of nah it should be new kirin
Huawei,P60 Pro,is it safe to use banking apps with the pro im in south africa yes it is as safe as any other phone in the market android and ios my daily phones was the and series from huawei and banking apps worked fine you can visit your bank or even huawei if you have queries never had problem when it came to banking related apps on the huawei appgallery am south african myself bru
Huawei,P60 Pro,well it make really sense since smartphone cameras today are very good at taking pictures but more can please kind ly tell me whether the optical zoom with digital zoom on the pro plus or this ppro with only optical zoom comparison
Huawei,P60 Pro,well you cant do that cause it would have been done by now and even if its poss more well imagine your pocket would be bigger by now if that would be possible
Huawei,P60 Pro,if we could just integrate dslr camera to smartphone think this will solve our problem more well you cant do that cause it would have been done by now and even if its possible it would be thicker and bigger than normal smartphone
Huawei,P60 Pro,well if you can get close enough like few meters away then yeah you can take decent shots more if we could just integrate dslr camera to smartphone think this will solve our problem for dollars of course
Huawei,P60 Pro,my god dudeyou really think that you will be able to photograph wildife with phone more well can sometimes get closer and at zoom the foxes really do look amazing with my google pixel pro but go on continue claiming that smartphone cameras cannot take goodlooking photos despite the cameras being there for that reason
Huawei,P60 Pro,do live in the uk where foxes are abundant could not get clear picture at sunset of more my god dudeyou really think that you will be able to photograph wildife with phone buy camera with telephoto lens
Huawei,P60 Pro,like you need anyways do live in the uk where foxes are abundant could not get clear picture at sunset of fox in the fields because my google pixel pro only has optical zoom and adding digital zoom to it to make hybrid zoom just doesnt work well enough for the lighting conditions
Huawei,P60 Pro,no thats nope get telescope not phone bro
Huawei,P60 Pro,for those wondering about the state of google based on my research sadly havent own one yet still deciding between pro or wait iphone as my excuses to return to iphone since ip if you guys wanted to trying the lighthouse method that only works with malaysian unit of huawei phones and yes have tried the demo units here in malaysia played around with it im not sure if you switch region on setting it will work or not but the lightouse method allow you to install core google apps but you do not have google play store if you want google playstore you need to use the gbox gspace method instead
Huawei,P60 Pro,are apps like gbox and lighthouse safe they cant steal data from my google apps google is stealing data from you does it matter
Huawei,P60 Pro,over the years had lots of different flagship phones among them also some huawei phones my best phone was the huawei mate phanthastic phone with pen it had big flat screen and very good camera wish could see something like that again however the pro looks very beautiful although dont like curved screens with one of the best camera systems huawei is proving that also without leica cooperation they can deliver number one camera phone dxo mark maybe when the price comes down bit it would be phone worth considering
Huawei,P60 Pro,as long as the leaders of those two nations are showing so much pride dont think that more you mean the next step in economic strategy
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei pro more like panda pro
Huawei,P60 Pro,we all know that wont happen any time soon as long as the leaders of those two nations are showing so much pride dont think that they will cooperate with each other any time soon
Huawei,P60 Pro,no they are not allowed to work together until us and chinese president decided to end th more we all know that wont happen any time soon
Huawei,P60 Pro,does google play store support huawei no they are not allowed to work together until us and chinese president decided to end the trade war
Huawei,P60 Pro,just rcvd my huawei pro last saturday been using it for the past hours and it doesn more thanks for sharing am trying to think of reason for taking this over xiaomi ultra or xperia xiaomi is likely to have better camera and xperia has sd card mm jack and front facing speakers however huawei pro was my favourite camera of all time and am wondering if this is any better problem was that hauwei downgraded the pro camera software when the released
Huawei,P60 Pro,my pro from yrs ago still receive software updates up to now have and am still using emui
Huawei,P60 Pro,what about bank apps will it work on pro this is region specific and it actually depends more on the banks than on huawei in the middle east almost all banking apps are fully supported with native ie appgallery apps you will not need third party installations in europe some banks are supported with native apps targo hypovereinsbank outbank finanzblick finanzguru sparda ing tomorrow and many others and others through petal search
Huawei,P60 Pro,so explain why this cant be done with the gen wait for the mate pro since the gms thing huawei goes one gen behind not that it cannot be done
Huawei,P60 Pro,for the and lite both released in and both gmsfree still receive regular more thanks for the feedback wonder how long huawei will update to flagship phone when will harmony os be released globally brands say our phones will get android and years security updates what about huawei
Huawei,P60 Pro,euro for no huawei this is not gonna happen yes it is going to happen if you did not like expensive phone with no then that is okay because many people wants this phone in fact many people in my country go travel to china just to purchase the art is still developing technology nowadays yes should become staple in every phone but should not be criteria when you are purchasing phone unless you got some reasons this phone is so much cheaper than the iphone pro max and the ultra and ultra
Huawei,P60 Pro,my prp gets hot along the top of the frame not even doing intensive tasks maybe defective unit try seeking for warranty and replacement unit
Huawei,P60 Pro,can someone tell me why its yet can get xiaomi for with the same specs or eve more because with phone you get better build quality better battery life better camerasstabilisation ect and it feels more expensive unlike your xiaomi phone
Huawei,P60 Pro,but the ovb this mp output and the telephoto here mentioned as mp also the main more ovb is mp sensor but it can be croped to mp just like xiaomi did with xioami which is usin imx with is mp but xiami croped it to mp
Huawei,P60 Pro,not like they have specofoc processor they just dont include the modem on the antenna so explain why this cant be done with the gen
Huawei,P60 Pro,there isnt verison of snapdragon gen without modem you did not answer any of the questions
Huawei,P60 Pro,bought huawei mate pro in and still using it and believe me it still wows the people more ive seen youtube videos that people are able to install most google apps on this phone not sure about google assistant though
Huawei,P60 Pro,of users wouldnt even notice the difference between this chipset and the current one
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei is trying very hard and pushed themselves into investing into multiple res more finally someone with common sense about this topic thank you
Huawei,P60 Pro,didnt say the phone should be you need to learn to read that was probably someo more hahahaha the fact that you are stating that gen is trash processor the fact that you are stating why there is no dolby vision on huawei phones seriously bro are you saying that huawei should spend more money on having their phones certified ranting about megapixel ultrawide camera bro do you really know how smartphone cams work you are also stating that huawei is still blaming us for the lack of bro do you heard of us jealousy or should say us ban this comment and your other recent comments suggest that you are the one should be belong on the zoo done some research my dude maybe you could learn something lastly do not care if you read my comment or not just saying stop living under the rock and try to breath fresh air hahahaha
Huawei,P60 Pro,main sensor is imx inch am not sure about telephoto and ultrawide but think more but the ovb this mp output and the telephoto here mentioned as mp also the main pls refer to httpswwwhuaweicentralcomhuaweiptousesonyimximxforvariableaperturecamera
Huawei,P60 Pro,can respect people who keeps ranting non sense maybe you have to research more be more didnt say the phone should be you need to learn to read that was probably someone else though you are likely behaving like complete clown and arguing with multiple people so it makes sense that you lash out at me too you should be in zoo
Huawei,P60 Pro,request huawei please make phones with your kirin processors why do you depend on snapdragon you could definetely ask mr sleepy joe for that information make sure to ask him before his term ends
Huawei,P60 Pro,soon as saw kiddo stopped reading if you cant even speak to people with more can respect people who keeps ranting non sense maybe you have to research more before you even type thing here have seen your comment before and it is full of non sense stating that pro is equipped with last year chipset and it cost more than euros bro come on are you serious who on earth will be on the right mind to price phone with flagship processor at just euros sure there is xiaomi and other chinese brands but the fact that they sacrifice the quality of the phone is one trade off
Huawei,P60 Pro,excuse me snapdragon gen this chip is one of the optimize chip that has been released more soon as saw kiddo stopped reading if you cant even speak to people with respect you should just get some real hobbies and stop wasting peoples time with your drivel also learn how to use paragraphs
Huawei,P60 Pro,maybe would have bought this but how on earth did they let it come with the snapdragon gen more excuse me snapdragon gen this chip is one of the optimize chip that has been released at its time maybe you could have done some research before ranting about non sense kiddo first of all why the snapdragon gen well you can ask the current us president about this huawei cannot and mean cannot obtain the latest chipset because of the jealousy of the us second why huawei is blaming us for reasons mean this question is the most obvious can be achievable by having chip and that is something that many phone manufactures always rely on us companies like qualcomm and since the us is very jealous that huawei might overtake apple someday which it did in the us allows qualcomm to ship chips to huawei but not the latest ones and certainly no chip huawei is currently developing its own chip base on their nm architecture and this might be implemented on the huawei mate pro and onwards at that time the huawei mate pro will have snapdragon gen because the latest qualcomm chipset will be the snapdragon gen but before huawei can get that qualcomm must ask license to the us government if it would allow them to have gen chip they must sure that huawei cannot overtake their pathetic apple or should say no security threat in order to allow qualcomm to ship this but ofcourse the chip will be removed so no chip but huawei will just install their own chip lastly huawei phones are downgrade bro are you relying only on the fact that huawei just removed some phone features and other stuff like optical zoom or bro the software is currently updated to support steady and steady without needing literal lens to support that finally here is my advice to you maybe you have to research more before you type something here you sound like an empty can doubt you even own huawei phone at all and you know who is ridiculous here no one but you for your ignorance and lack of research before typing and the us government for stating freetrade if only they are winning almost forgot why there are so many people whinning about is still capable just adds tiny bit of strenght and speed to your mobile data on most countries and it is wasting your battery big amount of percentage and lastly on most countries is much more advicable than get your facts right go home go to your laptop and try to research anything before you make rant about things your nickname suggest who you really are when it comes to smartphones
Huawei,P60 Pro,see basically nothing on the internet mentioning an gen outside of this more there isnt verison of snapdragon gen without modem
Huawei,P60 Pro,whats the type of the camera sensors sony or samsung or ov also whats the sensor and pixel size main sensor is imx inch am not sure about telephoto and ultrawide but think that telephoto camera is using ovb inch sensor when it comes to the ultrawide camera the only sensor see that could be used is ovb inch
Huawei,P60 Pro,bro what do you mean by camera bezel the frame around the camera
Huawei,P60 Pro,just came across this phone today and my god it looks stunning
Huawei,P60 Pro,because they are banned from using there isnt version of sd gen with modem see basically nothing on the internet mentioning an gen outside of this and the mate pro you mean to tell me that qualcomm has whole new assembly line for variants of the gen and huawei just conveniently happens to be the only customer are you sure they arent just specially making these chips for huawei why not do the same for the gen whats different
Huawei,P60 Pro,the phone world is going crazy look at this design trash coming from human being who cant even build phone eh
Huawei,P60 Pro,for non phone it is really alarming to find people like you pricing more than the phone itself
Huawei,P60 Pro,question that cant quite understand samsung ultra mp iphone pro max more if your question my friend is about the megapixels in the camera then would try to answer your question as best as could as for smartphone cameras megapixels are the only factor that makes camera powerful to take incredible photos you should factor in the camera sensors ex apple camera sensor sony imx omnivision ovb the camera software and camera algorithm the phone processor itself and so much more the reason why apple phones can take beautiful photos even tho their megapixel count is much lower is because of the software and the camera sensor itself but remember that is the basics of why megapixel is not everything correct me if am wrong at some parts
Huawei,P60 Pro,lte is big joke yeah good joke is that when you add minimal changes to new phone from its predecessor and ask people to pay dollars more oh forgot that joke belongs to tim cook
Huawei,P60 Pro,where is review
Huawei,P60 Pro,atleast huawei change their designs unlike other brands who copied the circle design and the more you mean iphone design
Huawei,P60 Pro,camera bezel thats just too big bro what do you mean by camera bezel
Huawei,P60 Pro,anyone knows the sar eu value of the pro cannot find it anywhere please if anyone can link me to the info would be very grateful bit sensitive around rf devices
Huawei,P60 Pro,the series though always used the latest kirin chip in the past its just that the ne more there are also rumours that the mate pro will have technology
Huawei,P60 Pro,why would they be able to get the gen but not the gen genuine question because they are banned from using there isnt version of sd gen with modem
Huawei,P60 Pro,thousand bucks and it doesnt have an gen here in my country this phone is more than thousand bucks but the iphone pro max version is almost bucks and the brand new ultra with the is almost at price range and huawei has offered more than dollars worth of freebies when you have pre ordered this beauty in my country and will expect its price to drop down below dollars next year
Huawei,P60 Pro,everything what said and much more has xia pro yes the xiaomi pro has it all like the buggy miui unoptimized camera software and years of software updates and years of security patches
Huawei,P60 Pro,im excited for this device everyone whining about the chipsetmeanwhile they don more everything what said and much more has xia pro
Huawei,P60 Pro,they couldnt get the gen due to the us restrictions so they had no choice other than more why would they be able to get the gen but not the gen genuine question
Huawei,P60 Pro,why is huawei trying to push people away with their price intimidation that price is for the us not for the rest is fault of the ban yes you can get lower price in alot of other locations and mainland
Huawei,P60 Pro,im sure its to do with the fact the series concentrates on camera while the mate more the series though always used the latest kirin chip in the past its just that the new kirin chips were released right before the mate series the mate series would come out late in the year think around novemberdecember with the new kirin chip and the series would use the same one in march at the moment on chinese social media it is rumored that even the huawei mate series may not have the snapdragon gen may still get the gen as they still havent got approval to get the latest chip qualcomm needs new license from the us to be allowed to supply them
Huawei,P60 Pro,fir all the genius here huawei supposed to be the one of the vest mobile phone company in the world unless the us ban xiaomi is nothing to compare was have all the series and mate series to when they was not banned always they was one step head in some amazing technology that the otherd doesnt have it or have but in poor quality against huawei phones if wasnt the us ban theyre the strongest competition agains samsung
Huawei,P60 Pro,andit already is on at camera performance on dxomark though ive seen so far one review and compared to the find pro or xiaomi ultra cant really say it is worth that titleyeah well dxomark isnt trustworthy anyways in their ranking
Huawei,P60 Pro,what year is it huawei pro with gen and are you from the past lol the only human being here in the past is you my friend havent heard of us jealousy
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei generally should ensure to dominate the smartphones market with endless incentives and price reduction these will definitely help and boasts the increase in purchasing the product users of huawei do value the high sense of reliability and guarantee the fear of us is huawei why the domination of mobile world is what they fear of come onboard with aggressive incentives
Huawei,P60 Pro,still going strong with my pro with no signs of it slowing down
Huawei,P60 Pro,can any one help me
Huawei,P60 Pro,this mobile available fpr google play store no
Huawei,P60 Pro,thats okay the mate pro is rumored to be ready or you can buy their phone cases but you gotta pay extra
Huawei,P60 Pro,blame trump for the ban on huawei thats okay the mate pro is rumored to be ready
Huawei,P60 Pro,still no lmao what does the us ban have to do with anything plenty of providers in chin more think it only depends where you live on here in the philippines this phone the variant roughly sells for of the price of an iphone pro max version and it sells almost half the price of the samsung ultra so here in my country if you are going to buy this phone for camera purposes guess this phone is great choice
Huawei,P60 Pro,no more leica after series leica was there for the sake of pure advertisement they dont do any technology cameras are from sony samsung and omnivision lens mostly from them as well or own inhouse
Huawei,P60 Pro,hmmm no curve screen is premium looks but always hard to ppay games because of us ban theyre not allowed to use chipset
Huawei,P60 Pro,why huawei jump from mp to mp and from optical zoom to only for me witch hav more will be hypothesizing but think that optical or optical zoom can be used for portrait shots and on the pro their zoom is still stable so think huawei thought that having or optical zoom is not always practical so they go for the optical zoom and just use software to stablize and zoom but for the record really dont know actually whaahhhaahahh
Huawei,P60 Pro,haters are going to hate that huawei is still kicking off these days why huawei jump from mp to mp and from optical zoom to only for me witch have pro sounds like an dowgrade
Huawei,P60 Pro,still my huawei is great love it above the other brands especially above google ones
Huawei,P60 Pro,know that im just giving an example of haters complaining bout those things haters are going to hate that huawei is still kicking off these days
Huawei,P60 Pro,gen is still very capable processor and if huawei can price their phone very right the more know that im just giving an example of haters complaining bout those things
Huawei,P60 Pro,exactly so tired seeing people comment like thatno no gms no buy more gen is still very capable processor and if huawei can price their phone very right then this phone could get some huge sales
Huawei,P60 Pro,hows the battery life any info on the sar values cant find thing on those two
Huawei,P60 Pro,are you living under rock ask us exactly so tired seeing people comment like thatno no gms no buy gen like dude ask sleepy joe about that
Huawei,P60 Pro,ufs is or
Huawei,P60 Pro,are you living under rock ask us
Huawei,P60 Pro,
Huawei,P60 Pro,repeat after me you dont need google mobile services to survive huawei mobile se more people who repeated after you
Huawei,P60 Pro,will get my pro in black before the end of this month cant wait if it was me would be totally getting the beautiful mother of pearl version
Huawei,P60 Pro,you might be lucky or have confirmed order as they have been withdrawn from online sites due more always bought china version of huawei
Huawei,P60 Pro,then why you buy samsung hahaha we buy for the other specs not for the zoom
Huawei,P60 Pro,they went from optical zoom lmao why would you even need such far zoom
Huawei,P60 Pro,pro suppose be able to support wifi or maybe wifi seem not this year for pro
Huawei,P60 Pro,see huge ass camera so want to see its parameters but theres no mention about the sensor size wtf
Huawei,P60 Pro,that sounds like cope is wifi tier internet chargers and portable chargers are extremel more they do not lack heck huawei is the first innovator of in china is covering major parts of the country using huawei thats why us bannedsanctioned them because they are way ahead with technology soon they are just not allowed to use on their phones to sell worldwide
Huawei,P60 Pro,same is toaster or battery drainer thats why very very rarely use it unless more that sounds like cope is wifi tier internet chargers and portable chargers are extremely easy to come by huaweis lack of just proves that neither huawei nor chinese manufacturers are actual innovators and will be stuck producing inferior products that require subsidization
Huawei,P60 Pro,dont need have phone but have never used it is still relevant even for more same is toaster or battery drainer thats why very very rarely use it unless need to transfer data fast otherwise stick to or even that is luckily still available in my country also it seems huawei is about to mainstream which is supposedly much more efficient more optimized than current hopefully soon
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei came to stay and coming with innovative gadgets every release of producti used to us more same using huawei pro and gunning for the huawei pro
Huawei,P60 Pro,dont worry guys many countries are starting to dedollarize so google slowly aint gonna be needed
Huawei,P60 Pro,so many rants about no google no buy it just shows how dependent from google pe more how do they love comments here love your comment you explained how dependencies dont many to explore
Huawei,P60 Pro,the majority are trolls they love repeating the same old record and listening to themselves more just let them live under the cave they are just jealous on how competitive and unique huawei products are
Huawei,P60 Pro,completely agree on your statement but there are so many people who cant live without more the majority are trolls they love repeating the same old record and listening to themselves they think this is gonna affect the companys reputation sad trolls
Huawei,P60 Pro,we live in year but use no google play servies is really important to you because for me is just battery waster
Huawei,P60 Pro,euros this kind of tech you spend anyone with money who cant spend buy more pure hate show in your comment huawei didnt force anyone to buy their phones just look away if you cant afford it iphone and pixel pictures cant beat mate pro try get your fact right
Huawei,P60 Pro,its the case or maybe they are still following the tradition of installing the last gen more they are not following any of this kind of tradition the chips didnt belong to huawei they only used whats made available for them the banned was more restricted towards ending of last year thats why they couldnt use new camera tech and chips
Huawei,P60 Pro,looks goodbut why they dont try to get google play servicesor send the harmony software in europe
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei isnt allow to use latest tech thats why they used gen mate pro more its the case or maybe they are still following the tradition of installing the last gen mate series phone to the newer series phone they have chance to fit the gen on the pro but they chose to fit the sd and the kirin chipset on the pro and also they were permitted to use the latest chipset at that time on the huawei mate pro which is the snapdragon gen so for me huawei is still following tradition and when it comes to on their smartphones do believe that it will take year or two or three for their smartphones to have connectivity
Huawei,P60 Pro,lens are not technology lol they are just some basic physics you sure know lot about physics
Huawei,P60 Pro,you can remove the word leica and huawei from your memory now huawei dont need leica an more lens are not technology lol they are just some basic physics
Huawei,P60 Pro,love huawei camera but problem is no google and thirdparty google think not safe too
Huawei,P60 Pro,hopefully huawei will comeback with its own kirin chip pair with leica lense in the future you can remove the word leica and huawei from your memory now huawei dont need leica anymore they have their own tech called xmage
Huawei,P60 Pro,let me give you some interesting facts when first came out huawei heavily advertised on more oh really nah they are probably fake advertising
Huawei,P60 Pro,what makes me angry is the art version or whatever is the best and is only in china think if this phone is cheap might swap but dont know yet probally not but it reminds me of the exynos vs snapdragon argument before the
Huawei,P60 Pro,it is really sad that it is not equipped with the latest flagship sensor but think that is more good job on huaweis end with the ban but its bit lacking in the newest spec apartment
Huawei,P60 Pro,is gimmick but is necessary for the price let me give you some interesting facts when first came out huawei heavily advertised on capabilities and accused rivals of providing fake last year however huawei began to advertise harmonygg
Huawei,P60 Pro,no meant irrelevant to the topic was talking about sorry for misunderstanding
Huawei,P60 Pro,how in the world that expandable storage were an irrelevant feature its choice hms isnt more no meant irrelevant to the topic was talking about
Huawei,P60 Pro,what youre saying is basically irrelevant am literally talking about huawei mobile se more how in the world that expandable storage were an irrelevant feature its choice hms isnt that bad though but couldnt get immersed into it because dont have my very own huawei device
Huawei,P60 Pro,speak only when have information huawei has email service called petalmail they also more even if they have those they are nowhere at the level of googles stuff
Huawei,P60 Pro,pal youve been living under rock or what huawei has been banned by the us and they more is gimmick but is necessary for the price
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei are so generous by giving expandable storage even its nano sim shaped its faster than more what youre saying is basically irrelevant am literally talking about huawei mobile services not about the disadvantages of huawei
Huawei,P60 Pro,when it will launch in nepal
Huawei,P60 Pro,my retake on this with the updated specs is so the specs are ok and the chips isnt more it is really sad that it is not equipped with the latest flagship sensor but think that is how they placed processors on their series flagship they use the processor they have used in the previous mate series phones
Huawei,P60 Pro,what really they usually release one series per year either mate or they are once because of the shady us ban but just like in they have released two flagship phones series in one year the series and the mate series and think they are doing that kind of tradition again
Huawei,P60 Pro,stop defending huawei lol hms obviously doesnt even come close to gms doesnt have an email more speak only when have information huawei has email service called petalmail they also have their own cloud drive where can back up your data
Huawei,P60 Pro,its shame people like you are depended on service like gms when you have other and bet more stop defending huawei lol hms obviously doesnt even come close to gms doesnt have an email service doesnt even have at least gb of free drive space no office apps etc
Huawei,P60 Pro,yeah guess you are joking nope
Huawei,P60 Pro,mate pro is coming out this year not next one months from now probably with solid more what really they usually release one series per year either mate or
Huawei,P60 Pro,snapdragon gen gen theyre not really that far apart from each other and more mate pro is coming out this year not next one months from now probably with solid battery boost too
Huawei,P60 Pro,shows in the specs its leica its mistake leica doesnt work with huawei any
Huawei,P60 Pro,its no for flagship dont use but for this price is expected and huawei st more yeah guess you are joking
Huawei,P60 Pro,was looking for the pro with gen cpu this is no good will wait for mate pro in more snapdragon gen gen theyre not really that far apart from each other and about mate well who knows if theres going to be one and if there would be one it would release next year in septembernovember
Huawei,P60 Pro,the family is very stylish and beautiful especially the art model is very beautiful hope global prices will be at an acceptable level for huawei to sell well in the market it should not upset those who support the brand in terms of price
Huawei,P60 Pro,hey yo even zte nubiaaxon ultra has af for the ultrawide camera
Huawei,P60 Pro,the differences are small and doesnt make any impact nice joke bro
Huawei,P60 Pro,releeased after it should get sdragon gen not the differences are small and doesnt make any impact
Huawei,P60 Pro,oh and btw where is huawei
Huawei,P60 Pro,apple had home button but huawei had never had home button now apple also has no home button more ignore him for his rants
Huawei,P60 Pro,true true even though west blocks huawei they steal the ideas from huawei rd work and th more you must be working for all those companies to know who steals from who so smart
Huawei,P60 Pro,the art edition is pretty uniquely interesting though wouldnt name it pretty
Huawei,P60 Pro,exactlyand huawei stil beats samsung and crapple true true even though west blocks huawei they steal the ideas from huawei rd work and the other chinese companies too are stealing the ideas from huawei to get to the top ranks
Huawei,P60 Pro,but they are copycats whose tech is largely attributed to stealing apple tech they cannot bea more phone companies are typically duplicating each others design and features but atleast huawei always comes up with new design in their flagship phones unlike apple and samsung
Huawei,P60 Pro,us still have not provided any evidence of security threats it is just an excuse to sabotage more exactlyand huawei stil beats samsung and crapple
Huawei,P60 Pro,still leica optics im more interested to know if it comes with or it will have more no leica no
Huawei,P60 Pro,it wont have because they are banned from using it due to security threats us still have not provided any evidence of security threats it is just an excuse to sabotage huawei because they are overtaking samsung apparently sanctions on huawei are politically motivated
Huawei,P60 Pro,there is an error on this page at the top it states mah and at the bottom it states mah for the battery
Huawei,P60 Pro,its political game for us government to restrict huawei
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei the heart of the cell phone is to be the snapdragon gen processor although huawei is not allowed to use the version due to trade restrictions there are no such limitations with the oled display inches and refresh rate of hz can be assumed here no wifi be us
Huawei,P60 Pro,no no more leica with huawei leica is now partnered with xiaomi yeah its so sad have my old mate and the camera quality is absoloutly amazing now use
Huawei,P60 Pro,why huawei launching phones not can any body tell is not is that im more huawei phones have that sanction that limits what tech they can put in their phones for example the huawei mate pro which released some time ago was only allowed to use and had the snapdragon gen chipset specifically made to only include apart from the sanctions there are other reasons thought would not know the specific reasons please feel free to add on or correct me if am wrong thought
Huawei,P60 Pro,still got my smart and its still living on great smartphone period
Huawei,P60 Pro,still havent read any no mm jack not for me comment id pay more for phone with headphone jack sadly most smartphones specs are nowadays the same
Huawei,P60 Pro,doesnt support they arent allowed to use last phones supporting it were and mate series
Huawei,P60 Pro,hope that it will have the same pwm pulse width modulation as mate pro as it was around more yeah no is definitely bonus turn if off in other phones but they just waste lot of space in the precious case for technology that doesnt work will never work and was just put there for different purposes as is good enough for anything youd want to do on phone headphone jack is useful modem completely useless so why is the useless thing in there and the useful thing not hilariously is also faster than in many areas usa lol so to get higher speeds in the usa need to turn off
Huawei,P60 Pro,thats an improvement dont see that as an improvement dont even see wireless will ever replace wired at all especially for audio
Huawei,P60 Pro,always love huaweis camera performance but my goodness that rear camera design is ugl more the main is not sony imx um pixel size it will be sony imx optical format um pixel size almost same size camera sensor used in oneplus pro
Huawei,P60 Pro,leica optics no no more leica with huawei leica is now partnered with xiaomi
Huawei,P60 Pro,you have to wake up it is even written on the back of the orange back photo im talking about specifications fella and if its rumor it has to be fact finding
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei still has expandable storage but in nano sim form but atleast they get one its also more because huaweis nm card is as fast as internal storage that might sound great but it cost lot of money personally keep the existing speed as recommended by sd association and make nanosd card that way you can still be within the price of existing microsd cards
Huawei,P60 Pro,huawei always best
Huawei,P60 Pro,this phone look like something came out from my over the top randomness dreams
Huawei,P60 Pro,so have been seeing these arent the real spec so that is kind of bad thing agreed
Huawei,P60 Pro,ok so my take on this the chip and specs are nothing to special apart from the chip but the more so have been seeing these arent the real spec so that is kind of bad thing
Huawei,P60 Pro,that camera lens is comically big its like those stupid photoshops were they take bulge tool and make someones eyes appear much bigger than they are thats what this looks like
Huawei,P60 Pro,wow this looks like cheap redmi note series phone looks horrible
Huawei,P60 Pro,who wrote these specifications for pro with leica camera functionalities gsmarena wake up didnt huawei ditched leica since like mate well guess they regret by dumping leica to xiaomi
Huawei,P60 Pro,omg what is that
Huawei,P60 Pro,kinda like the look something new for change not the same old patterns all over again
Huawei,P60 Pro,as anyone here uses the huawei nano memory card before how durable is it any idea
Huawei,P60,its not installed by default but you can install google with few steps its easy how can install google playstore in my huawei novai please
Huawei,P60,the snowden leaks from are enough proof the us is spying on everyone theyre not do more guess the us does very good job by persuading countries to hide facts that will benefit the us itself
Huawei,P60,nah phones spying people are just thing of the past once you have type your personal infor more the snowden leaks from are enough proof the us is spying on everyone theyre not doing good job at hiding anything lol no better than china anyway
Huawei,P60,yes they can still use google but no offense to them but only huawei has battled an american more true huawei have very low secure private in china always spying people
Huawei,P60,why no esim if you bring phone to over seas important function theyre blocked from the necessary ip patents
Huawei,P60,managed to hold black in my hand must say changed my mind it actually looks and feels pretty good good feeling matte back side and camera module looks way better than on photos but still its too big so not an option make it under maintaining camera configuration and ill take it
Huawei,P60,xiaomi still allowed to use google play services then there is oppo realme oneplus remember huawei software is way better than miui
Huawei,P60,with the exception of the huawei mate huawei is actually slightly behind apple and samsung more definetely agree with you the huawei mate pro should have dual speakers and removing the physical volume buttons is pain for some people the hisilicon kirin was huaweis last and finest processor for now it uses older arm gpu and it may not be as powerful as the snapdragon and the bionic but its performance and thermals are much more stable than the which will prefer by the way in terms of hardware could say that they are not always the best and they were behind once they are banned their kirin processors are not always the best in benchmarks and others and they definetely behind samsung and apple when it comes to software support since samsung and apple offer longer software support on their smartphones specially the flagship ones in terms of ui well it is on the users own preference for me think the part that made huawei phones special is its cameras really dont know how they have developed such good cameras but for me it is one of their main selling points most specially in this part that they are banned finally yes huawei is just another chinese company joining other chinese smartphone companies but for the us gov it is threat to their hegemony as huawei already surpassed apple on phone shipments in who knows what will happened to huawei and apple if huawei wasnt banned
Huawei,P60,ep may does the have no it wont but the mate is rumored to have
Huawei,P60,does the have
Huawei,P60,agree with you thankyou
Huawei,P60,thats because unlike the other companies huawei did some bad things and thus got sancti more they do but they are settled and huawei has paid huge sum of cash for that part the rest the ban and anything else was the result of huawei fighting us and western companies this is the price you must pay if you want your company to fight the us hegemony so to be fair with your argument yes huawei did some pretty sketchy things in the past but in the present the only reason they are banned is because the us is too scared that their apple would be rotten fruit if huawei was still going you could watch mrwhosetheboss video about why there are many people buying iphones and the number one reason is huawei so the reason why other brands can still access google it is because they remained on their current position and they never ever tried to challenge apple or any other us or western company huawei innovated put crazy but amazing features to their phones and kirin even defeated the bionic chipsets when it comes to performance stability they have surpassed apple in smartphone shipments in and one month after that they were banned they say it is security threat but obviously the only reason is they were scared that the us hegemony might be challenge the us government said that huawei is making deals with the chinese military then guess what apple and google is also doing business with the us military how odd you say well that is the us being the us is suppose
Huawei,P60,as they say the united states only believes on free trade and competitions if they are winnin more xiaomi still allowed to use google play services then there is oppo realme oneplus
Huawei,P60,its bllshit that this company has been banned using google services where most people more as they say the united states only believes on free trade and competitions if they are winning if not then you have to say bye bye most specially if you are not western company
Huawei,P60,and you how is and is there kind of seal on the box to prove that the phone is brand new and if it does how does seal on the box look like as im interested in it
Huawei,P60,but dream of trying huawei device the lack of google and other details that devic more cant be helped for westernus aligned nations that are beholden by their capitalistimperialist corporations
Huawei,P60,its time to bury huawei then maybe you can bury yourself first have shovel here if you need to
Huawei,P60,wouldnt say this phone is good because this phone does not have and sd gen is here would say there is better flagships like xiaomi and samsung
Huawei,P60,camera unit looks like mikey mouse resurrected and preparing to take revenge
Huawei,P60,huawei is world indeed the ban by us is nothing since the market is inflating we will never stop using huawei cos huawei is my mate like huawei
Huawei,P60,xiaomi is not much bigger than if you dont like samsung like me yes the xiaomi looks interesting but how is it with photos or you have the asus zenfone the size is okay but from the reviews the battery part is not good
Huawei,P60,its bin grt tym for the beast company huawei since its stupid us ban to stay in bssan more here to stay they arent new and they havent got any better how is this true flagship which bits
Huawei,P60,yes but samsung is not photophone dont like you can try the its the more its bin grt tym for the beast company huawei since its stupid us ban to stay in bssand now series in circulation over the marketand its true flagshipscompetitive en finally the company is here to staywe field had consumers we will stand for it till revival gs technologyget gadgets go on huawei global electronics
Huawei,P60,looks kickass
Huawei,P60,same size as pro this is flop no one who have been buying and needs giant shovel more yes but samsung is not photophone dont like you can try the its the best from all of the huawei phones for now
Huawei,P60,it looks good but where are the normal sized mobile phones where are the am really disappointed that the became phablet this has no sense hope they will do smaller model with same specs
Huawei,P60,just out of curiosity what device do you own and you
Huawei,P60,this release ticks all boxes to qualify for an upgrade ltpo oled color hz screen mah battery charger decent soc although wouldve loved seeing kirin soc and satellite communication and with this price tag its definitely win
Huawei,P60,have an huawei phone without google services yet can access all google content if need more just out of curiosity what device do you own
Huawei,P60,hope this phone makes it to international markets
Huawei,P60,plz android phone provide with
Huawei,Pocket 2,but sadly have heavy allergy towards all those private standards like nano memory
Huawei,Pocket 2,hats off to huawei for proving that its still possible to have card slot in foldable phone albeit huaweis own nm card instead of the universal microsd card theres literally no excuse to skip such stillrelevant feature on modern phones
Huawei,Pocket 2,anonymous mar no wifi no speed it has kirin which has capabilities
Huawei,Pocket 2,almost no crease
Huawei,Pocket 2,yourmom feb why is the screen on the back also circle it would easily get scratchedz flips cover screen have much higher possibility to scratch than the pocket
Huawei,Pocket 2,its and satellite message and talk capable phone
Huawei,Pocket 2,the first flip with tb
Huawei,Pocket 2,opposedscroll feb to try to catch any media attention they can oh look we did something differentquo morewe will see if that spectral camera is just renamed camera thing or gimick or it is really useful after all
Huawei,Pocket 2,frowningboat feb its recently been rumoured that the mate pro will have new kirin with snapdragon moreit is also reported that the huawei series could have chipset with varying clock speeds depending on the model here is my guess the base model could have the mate kirin chipset while the pro and art could have kirin with higher clock speed but there is rumor about another series and rumors has it that the art could have the gpp camera that the oppo find ultra is currently using but hopefully huawei will surpirse us with something
Huawei,Pocket 2,guest whooooo feb kirin or kirin probably but am more leaning towards the first one maybe the art morekirin could still be tweaked kirin as we still dont know anything about it
Huawei,Pocket 2,darlingyext feb from antistroboscopic to flicker sensors and now spectral whyto try to catch any media attention they can oh look we did something different huawei desperately needs sales rn
Huawei,Pocket 2,imagine cameras on flip phone
Huawei,Pocket 2,this would make one helluva gift for someone especially the fancy pattern ones
Huawei,Pocket 2,nice phone hoping this one will be having the kirin but with the us jealousy on full force think huawei have to improvise to develop new chips
Huawei,Pocket 2,june kook feb dont like phone without google service why
Huawei,Pocket 2,david feb yeah probably though well have to wait for the official announcement and full specs release kirin or kirin probably but am more leaning towards the first one maybe the art version will get the but who knows we will have to wait till march or maybe the kirin will be incorporated in the phone series onward
Huawei,Pocket 2,buy one for your girlfriend if you have one
Huawei,Pocket 2,hopefully theyll improve the flips external screen size next time if its really this small then it wont compete with oppo or even samsung in case of design lol
Huawei,Pocket 2,urs feb first flipfold with terra bites of space nah the mate and also have tb
Huawei,Pocket 2,first flipfold with terra bites of space
Huawei,Pocket 2,from antistroboscopic to flicker sensors and now spectral why
Huawei,Pocket 2,best phone
Huawei,Pocket 2,lamzijian feb what chip this use kirin syeah probably though well have to wait for the official announcement and full specs release
Huawei,Pocket 2,what chip this use kirin
Huawei,Pocket S,this companies are just redefining old phones of open and close
Huawei,Pocket S,coming from flip phone thats not this one not going to name the brand so im no more the one good thing about this flip phone is its the only one that have expandable storage albeit nm cards while other have none and yeah all of them have pretty much fragile plastic screens that gonna scratchbreak overtime
Huawei,Pocket S,oh wow foldable with card slot but its freaking huaweis proprietary one ho more there are actually other nm card makers making them not only huawei and as expected due to uswestern antichina policy they wont adopt nm cards due to it being china sponsored
Huawei,Pocket S,because american government dont let qualcomm give huawei their chips huawei can onl more believe they already breakthru nm but lacks fabbing machine to mass produce due to ofcourse us ban
Huawei,Pocket S,wow only huawei provide an expandable storagenm card on flip phone
Huawei,Pocket S,the circular design elements are nice the phone itself is doa just like huawei is zombie brand
Huawei,Pocket S,samsung galaxy flip is better than this phone in every way from hardware software qualit more dont think so flip doesnt have price for gb internal storage no card support no gb in total space no mah battery no fast charge no possibility to use only knox huawei software is perfect against google security britches
Huawei,Pocket S,does huawei just unused or deactivate the socs modem think the feature of the soc more no theres no modem and antenas for
Huawei,Pocket S,well nov its down to the os optimization to make the battery usage lasts most of these can still be more agree to me kirin chips were on par with qualcomm now mediatek took that place but litterary everything than speedtrum exynos and some other worse than bad cpus is better solution
Huawei,Pocket S,funny how even device with little but worse cpu to samsung flipcan easily beats samsung fl more its down to the os optimization to make the battery usage lasts most of these can still be controlled by the processor side and good one is important sadly they already no longer producing their own kirin chipsetif that rubberban din effect wonder how far can that chipset go in comparison to all others now
Huawei,Pocket S,huawei devices have the super device sharing system which is more advanced and smoother than more have both huawei pc and tablet the huawei share tool is very useful
Huawei,Pocket S,this better have stereo speakers otherwise the folding is basically gimmick
Huawei,Pocket S,why are you still using the snapdragon chipset still
Huawei,Pocket S,would you be so kind to explain why is in your opinion harmony better os then android or ios more harmony os is way more smoother already tried different version of android but when tried huawei harmony os its like butter using it ios is great for simplicity and the environment but harmony os is catching up
Huawei,Pocket S,thats the most stupid thing ive hear harmony os is better than android appl more would you be so kind to explain why is in your opinion harmony better os then android or ios for example im using both systems android and ios and cant decide which is better as they both have something need and want and have to say there is nothing lile apple and their ecosystem especially if you have other products within apple like mac or pad as far as know android and harmony are indeed very similar because they are based on the same open source linux software could google up about harmony os to find out their differences with other oss but just want to hear your personal opinion thanks in advance peace
Huawei,Pocket S,nice phonw but expensive maybe you can wait until the price be lowerlike pe
Huawei,Pocket S,do agree with youbut maybe this is new series in huaweis websiteit blongs to more youre exactly righthuawei is making foldable phone series called pocketbut the first pocket uses sd and the second use gnot very ideal processors for foldables lol
Huawei,Pocket S,hello may know why huawei does not want to implement onto their phones because american government dont let qualcomm give huawei their chips huawei can only design chips by themselves they cant produce chips by themselves they cant produce chips under nm
Huawei,Pocket S,snapdragon this is basically the cheaper uppermidrange version of the pocket much more do agree with youbut maybe this is new series in huaweis websiteit blongs to new series calledpocket
Huawei,Pocket S,you are buying this phone just for the fold even so my already yearold as would likely more you cant compare foldable to as they are different things though
Huawei,Pocket S,harmonyos is just android all the apps work and after installing gspace from huawei store more thats the most stupid thing ive hear harmony os is better than android apple ios if you know anything about how operating system works
Huawei,Pocket S,go huawei and try to lift the sanctions harmonyos right now if it doesnt run android more huawei is always open to work with us corporations it is us trying all means to isolate huawei and china app developers of most apps are more than willinghave migrated their apps to work on harmony os
Huawei,Pocket S,specs not good as mate
Huawei,Pocket S,so much for id range processor
Huawei,Pocket S,quality costs
Huawei,Pocket S,whats the price prices are cny for the gb storage variant and cny for the gb version these two will be on sale on november while third version with gb storage will arrive in december for cny
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,what applies to the ultra somewhat applies to the pro except for the retractable more what app is it for banking

Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,can someone give in depth review want to buy this phone but the specs are all over the place
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,anyone in europe bought one and can share their experience processor is deal breaker too weak the graphic processor is even worse was so waiting for this huawei who the top camera phone companyand finally replace mi ultra wished they have chosen mediatek and their dimensity
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,if they halve the price im interested
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,this article is from six years old now so
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,lets not wander around in delusion httpswwwtypewiseapppostsmartphonekeyboa more this article is from six years old now
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,here is the proof that chinese keyboards leak passwords and users data httpswwwscmagaz more am not using chinese keyboard app next
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,gsmarena is forgetting to show the front of the devices
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,show us the proof please here is the proof that chinese keyboards leak passwords and users data httpswwwscmagazinecombriefalmostabillionuserskeystrokespossiblyleakedbychinesekeyboardapps httpsspectrumieeeorgchinesepinyinkeyboardsoftwareexploits
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,all chinese keyboard apps have flaws exposing millions of users to keylogginga sledgehammer more show us the proof please
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,excellent
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,wait global release is this coming to the uk theres nothing at all on huaweis site to suggest it
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,doesnt really have anything to show the bizarre operating system and hardware shitty more not bad anything else
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro,the best technology brand and firm of this era love huawei
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,this is the best phone ever also there is big variation comparing to other models
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,cant find any big difference between pro plus and ultra version harmony os on pro on ultra android
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,used to stand for photography but now theyve rebranded the series into more the origin of huawei pura is from the spanish word puro and puro translates to english pure
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,android auto now working with all pura editions
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,almost made the mistake of getting the frequently overheated iphone pro according to my friends but heres the long waited huawei just in time its impressive
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,cptpower apr awesome specs crafty design definitely like it
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,there should be variation in size as well and it is hoped that it will be implemented in the coming days
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,about the thin bezels are so amazing overall specs are good one thing im worry about its the nanometer its run nm as of now common nanometer is nm this phone is quite good but not into it nanometer
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,hi is this phone support esim and smart remote control if you want to know whether any phone enable to use as remote control or not you can see phones spec with infrared port yes or no this phone can use as remote control but not sure can use with esim or not
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,gray grayer and grayest very creative
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,awesome specs crafty design definitely like it
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,terrible price pricey but not overpriced
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,terrible price compared to what
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,terrible price
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,so can someone tell me which maximum total optical zoom and maximum digital zoom are both bet more strongly advise you to wait for the reviews of the pura pro to come out and then decide while the pro had more optical zoom it would make sense for the pura pro to have the better overall zoom quality since it uses better hardware however the pura pro is also much better in other categories than the pro since its much newer smartphone so overall as whole package the pura pro is better and if you got the mony go for this one and not the pro
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,didnt know that the means in huawei series was pura it originally meant platinum then huawei changed their naming scheme like billion times and now its called pura
Huawei,Pura 70 Pro+,phone specs design everything
Huawei,Pura 70,lol of course its their fault they were caught stealing tech spying on us citizens more meh every nation is spying right now open your eye bro
Huawei,Pura 70,its all politically motivated western lies and propaganda us and the west portray china more correct amis stoping huawei because it was becomming successfull apple killer
Huawei,Pura 70,its premium device its not huaweis fault its gimped by no gms lol of course its their fault they were caught stealing tech spying on us citizens etc they were also caught cheating benchmarks what do you mean its not their fault
Huawei,Pura 70,nope in hands of pla soldiers putting some trojans into and again without any proof as always
Huawei,Pura 70,because he saw in the tv nope in hands of pla soldiers putting some trojans into
Huawei,Pura 70,why the hate for piece of glass and metal because he saw in the tv
Huawei,Pura 70,obviously its you dont know what your talking about because the vivo pro uses more great fully result and very beautiful camera and very comfortable service and also futures high speed and high quality mobile phone pura ultra
Huawei,Pura 70,read the word global and then reread my sentence before commenting again yes saw the word global and do not want to edit my previous comment thanks
Huawei,Pura 70,hahahahahaha did you actually just link to dxomark hahahahhahahaha they list the honor magic more if you know how to read yes regarding dxomark they are doing tests and they look more professionnal than you statements httpswwwdxomarkcomsmartphonecameraimagequalitytestprotocolacloserlook
Huawei,Pura 70,hahahahahaha oh so youre that kind of guy who cares about reality will more obviously its you dont know what your talking about because the vivo pro uses type sensor also that is the reality
Huawei,Pura 70,the best really here it is on the th position httpswwwdxomarkcomsmartphones hahahahahaha did you actually just link to dxomark hahahahhahahaha they list the honor magic pro as st for almost anything lets put aside the fact that its main sensor is just look at youtube comparisons with other phones the video recording is very juddery as if it has no stabilization on all sensors even the main one but especially the telephoto which is just garbage for video it also suffers from overexposure for photos as well as oversaturation the magic pro has mah more than the ultra but gets only minutes more lol dxomark is joke and so are you
Huawei,Pura 70,tiny how can you say this it will sell like pancakes read the word global and then reread my sentence before commenting again
Huawei,Pura 70,okay may have exaggerated bit to get ny point across but the amount of global huawei fan more tiny how can you say this it will sell like pancakes
Huawei,Pura 70,the pink looks tacky af for lady it should be fine
Huawei,Pura 70,how does camera compare to honor magic pro be patient results will come
Huawei,Pura 70,was literally just giving an example on how your argument makes no sense because its more and after it will finish with ragequit
Huawei,Pura 70,they have some gifts also ncluded in that price at least worth yes they offer one pair of freeclips
Huawei,Pura 70,nice coping mechanism right there made wrong buying decision you can argue about preferri more the best really here it is on the th position httpswwwdxomarkcomsmartphones
Huawei,Pura 70,you can find brand new apple iphone gb for usd easily in europe and iphone used to more sure but its limited to gb has no telephoto lacks hz does not run apples latest chipset well could go on but you get the point
Huawei,Pura 70,funny thing is you are objectively wrong the sensor that pro uses is imx which has more if thats true then yes im wrong vivo however doesnt name the sensor and the below inch measurement that they do list states otherwise though you might be right and might be wrong nevertheless the lyt isnt that big of an upgrade despite that the xiaomi ultra manages to deliver objectively worse pictures though like ive said if youre right about which sensor they have then im wrong about the size none of this means that the guy living in his own reality is in any way right he needs therapy
Huawei,Pura 70,theyre not now for obvious reasons you will note that was talking in past tense but more yes but you also said that their software must not be as bad as claim it to be and it wasntback when they had the play store now howeverits different story their skin also was never really that great it wasnt emui levels of bad but never oneui good
Huawei,Pura 70,excepttheyre not challenging their duopoly you another of those create more theyre not now for obvious reasons you will note that was talking in past tense but until the sanctions huaweis market share was threatening apple samsung
Huawei,Pura 70,taste is entirely subjective also huawei wouldnt have been challenging apple sams more excepttheyre not challenging their duopoly you another of those create my own reality kind of guys
Huawei,Pura 70,facts remain facts why because you say so the pro has the larges more hahahahahaha oh so youre that kind of guy who cares about reality will create my own like the camera on my nokia and that means thats the best camera xd xd xd anyway only the vivo pro has an actual inch sensor all others are inch type not that youd know the difference anyway since you live in your own reality xd
Huawei,Pura 70,that wouldve been great imo not the most competitive in the sense that you can buy an more cost more and that is not including gifts with gifts its double the price of
Huawei,Pura 70,only only lol early preorder is euro and includes over euro gifts so the phone is just euro which is just
Huawei,Pura 70,thats some wildly disastrous pricing huawei is deluded if they think they can sell even more they have some gifts also ncluded in that price at least worth
Huawei,Pura 70,cost rubles euro for today early pre order in russia and includes freebuds pro and magnetic case rubles euro from tomorrow
Huawei,Pura 70,doesnt matter theyre still charging more even though they dont offer more more dont know about anyone else but emui is unironically my favourite android skin oneui feels far too inconsistent
Huawei,Pura 70,mate there is no best camera smartphone anymore really and if there is the viv more nice coping mechanism right there made wrong buying decision you can argue about preferring certain software solution but facts remain facts vivo pro has the largest sensors with the least amount of oversharpening its by far the best camera for pictures iphone pro max is by far the best camera for video recording iphone pro is the only phone with pro sensorscameras there simply is no phone that small or smaller with better cameras overal
Huawei,Pura 70,yeah import taxes in eu is going to kill this phone and thats shame would love to see huawei back still dreaming about the good old days when had mate wish they would bring that beast back with up to date specs
Huawei,Pura 70,want the white pura will it get uk release we always seem to get very limited options
Huawei,Pura 70,german writer after confirming with hauwei says eu models will have
Huawei,Pura 70,it shouldve been like this pura at pura pro at pura ultra at the price is very good though for european price other chinese brands typically charge more in europe compared to china but huaweis pricing is only around more thats quite lot less mark up than their competitors of that would be vat so roughly more than china the pura pro for example is the same price as the xiaomi ultra in china yet its cheaper in europe much lower mark up
Huawei,Pura 70,not true at all its known fact the vivo pro has the overall best camera system more mate there is no best camera smartphone anymore really and if there is the vivo pro isnt it its definitely among the best thats for sure but its not better than say the xiaomi ultra and the iphone pro while it does have arguably the best video quality among smartphones and iphons in general do dont see the logicreason for categorizing it as the best overall camera system on smallish phone and the pros as the best setup on big phone but anyways the fact that the vivo pro has the best camera system on any smartphone its just not true you prefer it and its photos over any other smartphones then its the best for you but as already said smartphone cameras have become so good that theres no clear winner and its pure preference at this point
Huawei,Pura 70,dawg dont think your gonna be settling on phone phone just cant have it al more let it be heavy then would love to have mm phone without case that has back made from aramid fibres see no point in these glass slabs that are extra heavy and have terrible durability as well because of it
Huawei,Pura 70,tf xiaomi did it first huawei popularised the many step aperture opening steps vs steps huawei had the first step xiaomi had the step
Huawei,Pura 70,black and white like with the ppro
Huawei,Pura 70,the colors seem nice
Huawei,Pura 70,to say that huawei is incapable of selling single piece of this is to totally invalidate the more okay may have exaggerated bit to get ny point across but the amount of global huawei fans left who would get one of these is tiny im personally both very impressed and not impressed by its cameras and as someone whose main consideration when buying phones are their cameras can honestly say that id prefer getting the vivo pro oppo find ultra or the xiaomi ultra hate the main cameras retractable lens hate the mm lens of the main camera love the step variable focal aperture for the main camera even if xiaomi did it first love the periscopes cm minimum focusing distance thats an amazing feat of engineering love the use of quad bayer on the ultrawide hate the mm lens of the selfie camera even if it is very high quality love the use of type sensor for the selfie camera hate the lack of frontfacing tof sensor for face unlock hate that they didnt do wide ultrawide setup for the selfie
Huawei,Pura 70,base pura model has no nearlink technology and why remove nm slot on all models heres to hoping they also tank pro prices
Huawei,Pura 70,minions swore these phones would be china only to not get wh angry us will still raise stink in these they got mad few weeks ago when huawei released an intel laptop
Huawei,Pura 70,huawei always wasnt the type to price their phones competitively think their honor division is bit more competitive
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,mihai jul this is easily the best phone camera hardware ive tried when it comes to image quality moreyou ask too much from phone yes it can be done eventually but the price after all these options will be to big already the ultra phones have big price most of it because of the chip and photo capabilities that can be compared to some cheaper options from om panasonic fuji canon etc those with better lenses than the standard can do wonders in the hand of capable person
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,this is easily the best phone camera hardware ive tried when it comes to image quality but the camera software is infuriating it has an optional mp option in the default mode which does genuinely capture even more detail but suppose you wanted to use the diaphragm in this mode you cant it also doesnt have any type of ev compensation in the default mode it does have mode where you only control the diaphragm and nothing else but mp isnt available here of course you can change everything manually in pro except you dont get the mp here either you get mp which is worse than the default mp and the processing in pro mode is horrible and its not that its unprocessed because the raws look decent but if you dont want raw pro mode is nearly unusable so you more or less cant use the camera to the best of its ability regardless of what you do purely because of the software

Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,all these incompletely reviewed phones there is not single word about availability or the quality of sweep panoramas from any recent camera on any recent phone listen to the reviews in hope but always now gsmarena leaves out all such vital information which is lot easier and quicker to obtain than the excellent range of video samples or downloadable ordinary standard photographs

Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anonymous jun so to correct mistake from almost all reviewers no phone has sensor what they ha more we know that genius
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,markusleto jun what are they gonna see my prnhub usage yes you are right if someone is very confident about himself or herself then heshe can share the information with the company but those guys who says huawei spies on me thats why will not use it are those who earn moneywealth by working on illegal things in one words those people who cannot share the information with the company are not confident on themselves shame on you guys who says huawei spies on me whats the matter if huawei spies on you when youre confident about yourself
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,so to correct mistake from almost all reviewers no phone has sensor what they have is called type sensor since it is not in size

Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anonymous may wrong its worse because you get worse phone for that insane price tag thats moreworse than apple lmfao
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huaweifan may agreecheaper than the iphone and ultra in my country
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anonymous may but not as ridiculous as an iphone promax or samsung zfold wrong its worse because you get worse phone for that insane price tag thats what makes the difference and why this phone cannot be recommended for what you get anything above is daylight robbery
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,its perfectly fine phone but the rating is way too high performance is subpar the price ridiculous in terms of battery life huawei has some of the most aggressive app management have ever seen so id be carefully optimistic if it is once again achieved in an aggressive manner ending in delayed notifications it isnt worth much the lack of sucks too especially at that price point simply because it will cut this phones potential longevity short id give it flat max and that does not include the insane price tag yet
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,xslvrxslwt may ive tried this phone compared it to my fxu too much ai sharpening and artifacts make morewhere are you from and how did you get the new huawei pura if may ask how would you compare camera results with xperia vi or your worth vivo pro which you got for free have nice day
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,blendi may personally dont like the design its wery sketchyyou sure you know what sketchy means man the amount of comments from seemingly kids here is astounding
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,neph may thanks gsmarena for the review too bad that huawei are nowadays literally the only one good moreyes hooded crows are distinctively light grey with black head and wings strange that someone has given you an here

Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,good specs
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,that price is ridiculous lol
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,personally dont like the design its wery sketchy
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anonymous may literally no other camera phone can handle fast moving subjects like huawei they have stood morethere actually is another phone which not only does it but it is better at it the problem with huawei phones is that they rely mostly on software magic they do it with the help of ai and while havent tested it for myself am it is the same as when they did fps video which looked so artificial that it was not even worth it they have some interesting and capable hardware but those who want the best of the best in terms of mobile photography should definitely look somewhere else
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,thecommoncause may damn bro you high what you on couse want somedo yourself favor and search actual price of an iphone on google and maybe thatll change your mind
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,thanks gsmarena for the review too bad that huawei are nowadays literally the only one good cameraphones as samsung apple and google dont excel in this area ps the little black bird you photographed is eurasian jackdaw not hooded crow

Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,ikek may httpswwwreuterscomarticleiduskbnab huawei got banned for two reasons pos moreand will say is the one with the most weight you can cry all day long about us and their bans but zte got their ban lifted after complying to not sell stuff to iran and xiaomi bbk never got one oneplus even got into the us without any problems and is available at several carriers you are seriously hilarious guy lmao you just gave us proof without ever realizing it that this was not the real reason for the ban if it was really the reason as you want us to believe along with us government selling equipment to iran then huawei would have stopped it as did zte because the money they earn in iran is nothing compared to the rest of the world
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nomolos may and more chinese spyware is good for consumersis anyone forcing you to buy it no so whats your problem you can buy device made by different country you still will get spyware but from different country
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,notafanboy may define spywareagain didnt read single comment but theres no spyware if you debloat your phone via adb and block all the connections to the huawei china in general servers via private dns such as nextdns there are premade lists for both
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nick tegrataker may the burden of proof is on the accuser the end thanks for letting me know that you don morewho came with accusations national security agencies according to you they with no reason would tell governements to spend billions to replace the telecon do you ask evidence to those here that say apple is behind all this highly doubt in case you havent seen many fanboys here claim with zero evidence this was all to protect sales of iphones against rise of when had only of their sales outside their home market and significant of these were the subbrand
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no photo samples again what happened gsmarena
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,outstanding photo quality day and night selfies too sorry but cant see whats outstanding on the crow photos the grass processing is mess of green pixels it looks terrible maybe year later it might get good but right now is awful

Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,seriously outdated chipsetmidrange at best
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,amorphous diamond again dont you understand thats physical impossible
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anonymous may dear if you want evidence go work at these agencies do you expect this kind of info to morethe burden of proof is on the accuser the end thanks for letting me know that you dont even understand the basic principle that you need to prove your claim to turn it into believable one ive already given you an article where the us president proudly admits that he pressured his allies when they were hesitant about the ban come back with one solid proof that huawei has ever eavesdropped or spied on any communications ill wait
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,with no native android support unfortunately huawei devices are not even worth talking about very sad considering the hardware they really need to sort this out
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,latest iphone and it is not only one of the most beautiful smartphones lately even if youd think the gas cookerlike camera island on iphones is the most beautiful design objectively this design is neither latest nor launched lately dont see significant design changes in the latest iphone compared to the ones before it besides an even larger camera island
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yalim may trash phone outside china with that price just too many sw and hw limitations and requires wo morehave you experienced it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,propositionjoe may agree with people saying the price is high but dont trust people who claim the camera morespot on friend my pro is still alive and the phone beats many of the current ultra phones many here havent experienced huawei products but only to condemnation
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,gsmarena its not hooded crow its jackdaw check the white eyes its also smaller in size
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,thought oneplus open had best telephoto now huawei comes in and outdoes it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no google service no sd card no audio jack no buy
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,agree with people saying the price is high but dont trust people who claim the camera sucks knowing the internet they dont even have the phone aggregating all the reviewsyoutubers this site ect from people who have actually used the phone the cameras seems to be another win still have my pro if you know you know
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,trash phone outside china with that price just too many sw and hw limitations and requires workarounds for so many
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,inedian may why on dxodxo is paid service remind you
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lol lollypop may cause they are the king in the camera market guess
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lccy may dont really understand how huawei can output mp mm images from mm lens wit morehuawei cropped main and telecamera if you can see switch from main to ultrawide on xx so you can see if you decide to use the zoom wheel you will see that the switch from the main camera to the ultrawide one is done at the point on camera take shot from main sensor with mm pura ultra pro equivalent focal length no crop and use all area sensor
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nomolos may once again my post was deleted for daring to criticise the very very strange scoring practice moretry kimovil it has users score as well as editors score for every phone yeah but it could be heavily weighed by the cn having said that had so many disagreements with reviewers dont watch reviews where the person reads specs which to me is waste of time as can go faster over the spec sheet that is usually more complete anyway
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nick tegrataker may as always what you thought was good comeback isnt really comeback and you have fai moredear if you want evidence go work at these agencies do you expect this kind of info to what be posted on wikipedia
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,weirdly the con list does not have still android when is current version old bt when is latest old soc would be much fair score whete are those that fight to have some scores lowered here no speech now
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why on dxo
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,hate or love huawei but its first time in many reviews we have camera that when taking picture of grassfoliage show grassfoliage not blurred mess or super processed spaghetti
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,once again my post was deleted for daring to criticise the very very strange scoring practice giving this phone when it costs euro more than substantially better phones for year old android version with midrange chipset no bad audio and questionable cameras
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,this phone will make the sony proc look like steal
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,before huawei phones had more pros than cons in the reviews now in the same reviews they already have the same number of pros and cons and the price has not dropped recommend an honor magic pro much more than this huawei phone
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,deleted postlogic did and you clearly dont think logically you only believe what youre told without even checking the facts and nothing is more logic especially since it has been proven that literally all smartphone companies and tech companies in general spy through their devices and use your data kids these days know that much better than you so dont blame huawei that they were caught spyingselling your data because all companies do and that should very logically lead you to realize that there were plenty of other reasons that led to huaweis ban
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,useless device outside of china
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,as expected huaweis photos are more artificial than just artificially enhanced everything at night looks like its out of an ai photo generator details in the day look like they were made up great cameraphone for people who want to click photos and not think about it anymore fast shutter speed reliable software for the most part and wow the selfie game is on point but the artificial look is something dislike in modern phones and huawei has gone for it harder and harder ever since they released the mate pro this might net them higher dxomark scores but the photos just dont look nice they look uncannily bad like somethings bad but its hard to point it out zoom shots are joke for the most part they shouldve stuck with lossless crops and offered the as well so that people can get the lossless one first anyways good phone not for me at all the find ultras natural way of processing things and also xiaomis processing is just gonna be superior to me vivo is the perfect middle ground between huawei type artificial and oppoxiaomi type natural processing huawei thinks noise is bad and should be eradicated but noise is part of the image let some of it stay there and provide the detail it looks good when it is fairly untouched
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the review did not address the potential issue of dust and moisture ingress which leads to smudges dust spots and fungus growth by the movable main camera and how its mitigated this was an issue with point and shoot of the past
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,this should be on mid range price point soc so bad for
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anonymous may it is imx should be better sharpening should not exist horrible colour science too moreyou need to have some perspective on soft skills this phone takes the best pictures on the market and blows away everyone else in terms of fast moving subjects period missing usb or whatever does not take away from that
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,camogekoxda may believe whatever you want but huawei go founded out and got banned by google youd be morenope you are plain wrong us never able to give concrete proofs that huawei spy on american interests their main reason to put huawei in the entity list in case you dont know about this they only have circumstantial evidence like huawei founder is former pla officer and huawei supply equipments to pla and other chinese agencies samsung also supply equipments to us dod and military so we can also safely assume samsung help usa to spy on other countries
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,walkman may plenty of folks but the right question is is it worth buying the answer is no imo if yo morei think you need to look at better reviews of this device some youtubers have tested it with fast moving subjects kids pets cars etc it is hands down the best camera phone for anyone who shoots those things gsmarena didnt really cover it which is unfortunate ive yet to see phone that revolutionized photos since the pro with its night mode ive feeling others will copy the ai usage to handle motion going forward this will be the first huawei ive bought since the pro gbox and alternate apps will make gms forgettable finally im only giving up banking apps and google pay oh well bye bye google
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,not bad at all well done all things considered
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,images are horrible overprocessed mess but somehow theyve managed to make video even worse this has to be the worst flagship camera phone of the year
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nick tegrataker may hint these nations are the allies of the us who pressures others that dont follow thei moreyeah mi would just read what cia has to say and follow without doing own investigation fun fact the governments that cared about trump were all cs friends by the way germany has not removed their structure
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,david may dont see no artifacts or artificial sharpening in the images provided by gsmarena nor morezoom in brother leaves definitely should have white natural halo around them as well and concrete should be full of white halos
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,upon further inspection realised why ultras photos look bit off in many situations sharpening isnt problem it looks fairly restrained to my eyes but an aggressive hdr tonemapping and local contrast boost to emphasise details give these photos very iphoneesque look dont see any tint or colour shift caused by its ryyb cfa but everything looks as if it has been imported to lightroom and the clarity boost has been set to these photos have hard tonality which im simply not fan of think the sheer amount of effort put into the development of motion compensation algorithms is impressive samples on show it really can freeze movements without introducing lot of unnatural artifacts but what makes the cameras on xiaomi and oppo flagships so attractive is their colour mode leica authentic and hasselblad master mode really have muted look that adds depth to certain tones mostly greens huaweis greens in comparison simply look dull and flat in most of these photos huawei just doesnt have any character to its colour rendition and its something theyll have to figure out sooner or later
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,disappointed should have atleast priced it right but the telephoto quality seems good though
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,is it known whether the periscope uses again an ryb color filter
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,kev may this phone is honestly simply weaker but the main cameras genius design cannot be overs moreh has mm lens wider than that helps bit
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,it is imx should be better sharpening should not exist horrible colour science too iphone too bright foreground like samsung close inspection shows reflect too much light despite sunlight is not directing hitting them android bt not even wifi no usb still costs euros this is phone at most
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,funny how ppl here believe and are any different from chips that do not even support wifi and still only has bt support ultra suspicious
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,pureos may they has best technology but is forbidden by other countries without reasonits forbidden because huawei stole and sold peoples data in china to the highest bidder so they got banned by google
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,max may where photo compare toolthey stopped offering the photo compare tool for their new reviews earlier this year
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no this phone has capability in china
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,you couldve done more sales huawei if you only priced it right
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,uninspiring and childish back design that looks like little cubs face with sleepy eye and sticking out tongue as for the retractable lens id hate to think the mechanical parts are displacing solid state
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,too little for too much money
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no way too expensive
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei has slightly increased the focal length and the effective aperture diameter of the periscope camera the effective lens diameter is now mm instead of mm pro
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,ive tried this phone compared it to my fxu too much ai sharpening and artifacts make it inexcusable for device looks diehard
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,where photo compare tool
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,jimmythegreatest may who can afford this phoneplenty of folks but the right question is is it worth buying the answer is no imo if you are really into niche photography skills pick either vivo pro or xperia vi if you want jack of all trades for best video get pro max or even xiaomi ultra the funniest thing all of the mentioned devices are the same price or cheaper than huawei they really missed the mark with this one
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,who can afford this phone
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anyone knows about next emui update for huawei pura ultra for global usersphone launched in more dont think there will be another emui update sadly expect it will just be monthly security updates for years from release then it will move to every quarter
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why overpay for the pura ultra if the pura pro has practically no difference in photo qu more there must be other factors like the main cameras sensor shift ois retractable lens and mp ultra wide and perhaps the design and bought pieces of the huawei pultra for euros each they are both the highest variant and if were given an other chance to choose all over again would still choose the ultra and an other reason could that they differ in back camera design thats my view the kun lun glass bassalt tempered might better
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the green colour looks nice and it did exceed my expectation and if there were other colours would have chosen the white the brown colour honestly
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,once said that wish ed that the back design of the hua wei ultra had the same back design as the huawei ultra but changed my mind and realize that this ultra somehow looks better and maybe more premium than that to the huawei pultra and fell in love with the design and symmetrical bezels on all of its four sidesthe curved screens too on its edges the moment open ed and see it and will be waiting for the huawei pultra or pultra when it has an sic battery and at least optical zoom digital zoom for picture taking an least digital zoom in video recording and let me share some details with guys right here here go hua wei pro has maximum of for picture taking has maximum of for video recording hua wei pro has maximum of for picture taking and has maximum of for video recording hua wei ultra has maximum of for picture taking and has maximum of for video recording
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,in respect of everyone opinion this thing of limiting international products is not right because we also need to have access to satellite connection not this thing of china only or am missing something here please give me clarity if its so thank you
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,gb ram with such weak cpu they could put into smart mediatek helios and price more you do know that they are banned from the us sanctions right
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,which chipset do you consider better than kirin snapdragon gen lol
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nice one
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the last huawei pura series with under display fingerprint
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,what kind of tvmonitor you have with resolution nothing
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dollar for nm cpu people paying dollars for samsung with camera setup from in and you dont see problems there
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,so what you want is mate what want is the back design of the honor magic pro the optical zoom digital zoom superslowmo of pro front glass protection bassalt tempered of the ultra finally an ip ip ipk with sic battery technology prefer an ordinary back cover so hope the pultra will barter plastic back to an mah of battery
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,what really looking forward to in the ultra is the change in its back camera design more so what you want is mate
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yeah good point but wouldnt the case just make the phones heat dissipation worse suspect it really is an issue especially if you live in country with hot weather should remove the cover while charging or doing some other intense task yeah know its kinda stupid
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,octa core or core
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,highe end cpu super high end gpu is optimisation dang bro is knowledge no is england yes
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,well why would you want better heat dissipation when it destroys your ability to play games more true true everyones preferences are different
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,because the device gets burning hot when gaming and you cannot hold it due to heaving sweaty more yeah good point but wouldnt the case just make the phones heat dissipation worse
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why gaming session of all things because the device gets burning hot when gaming and you cannot hold it due to heaving sweaty fingers from the heat if you play demanding games youd know
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,who buys pura buy mate pro plus or rs ultimate design real huawei fans buy the mate rs not more ive finally decided to use my huawei pultra and just going to skip the mate pro plus and just go straight to ultra or the mate pro plus as next purchase ve waited way to long for new huawei pro plus which doubt there are still some left in the market now ive been waiting for the optical zoom and digital zoom and fps super slow motion in the pro plus hence bought the hua wei ultra how ever will again buy hua wei if these features are available in the ultra or mate pro plus and if not will just wait for the series or until they offer these
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,really hope to see the next gen of this phone soon its getting bit old hope to see it as the pro or something my last huawei was the pro which was my favourite smartphone despite the weird resolution camera was just phenomenal unfortunately harmonyos kind of sucks however theres lot to love with eg their lhc audio codec and freebuds pro mbps bitrate which smokes sony xm its just shame that usa has somehow crippled them even years later want to see more huawei in the west europe etc its great brand
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,do believe that huawei will at least make an upgrade which will balance between it self and more who buys pura buy mate pro plus or rs ultimate design real huawei fans buy the mate rs not pura thats why bought the mate
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the price the lack of the fact that vivo and managed to outshine them in the camera department and performance at lower prices it just got obsoleted very quickly
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dont use case unless in heavy gaming session why gaming session of all things
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,any one here tell me which is more tough is it the huawei ultra or thr huawei mate pro plus in terms of protection ultra with kunlun glass bassalt tempered or the mate pro plus with only kunlun glass and also which total zoom is better between the and also the ip
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,price in germany for gb lol can buy vivo pro for this price under in eastern europe
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,that camera bump is hideous and way too large
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,made it to indonesia and its late and slow for nope it is official with free huawei watch gt and free buds interesting
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,want the best camera phone and torn between huawei pura and vivo ultra chose huawei cause of local warranty and support here in manila but worried on its not that good chipset due to huge gap antutu scores vs snapdragonmediatek but deymmmm my passion for photography adds up and yes its the best camera ever yet
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,im jumping on the pura wagon great phone indeed and deserves all the hype
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,samsung is better than huawei thats your opinion didnt state any opinion anywhere youre just being ignorant
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,we arent blind we can see that you do lmao samsung is better than huawei thats your opinion
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nm processor in performance for dollars what are android manufacturers do more bro im sure your comment its sarcastic or you are really blinded eyes snapdragon or mediatek only android its the unique manifacturer can run all games you write if you think how ive sayed im sorry for you remember unisoc with the txx its not the best in anything but at least run genshin at fps not lower fps in low graphics will not defend any smartphone brand because all have their mistakes but passed for much phones since to today and like ive sayed all have their mistakes yes huawei dont have play services but this not mention its impossible have yes ive changed my phone for what im using now second hand huawei mate with harmonyos ill ever test everything for the smartphones have and this one is the example like gaming or cameraetc ive successfully installed play services without gbox or anything the camera for takes good photos and its still surprising me because its phone opened and main camera broken without crystal for games run everygame you want in this specs ill torture the cpu and gpu with heavy games genshin wuwa diablo inmortal zzz in racing aspects play racing masters and need for speed mobile its not the nfs no limits and everything run in ultra without lag or big hoverheat ill tested samsung tecno camon premier with dimensity tecno spark pro huawei and honor all phones the camon premiere not runned all games in mid graphics the phone with poor optimization for me is the mtk dimensity surprising the helio ultimate with better optimization in games tecno spark samsung and the huawei cant run smooth in low or mid settings carx street or wuwa dont want write too much so the kirin have the same specs or better than mtk and snapdragon series similar to gen in some aspects obviously didnt mentioning this huawei is launched in
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,honor did that with their phones honestly no idea why huawei doesnt with their best flagship honor is totallt dufferent company now from huawei

Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,do you like your comments not exactly
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,currently using pro im happy with it so wish they could have given us who loves curved display an option to choose then flat display hope mate series will have curved design
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,and google is not tied to the government in which fairy tale are you living youre clueless httpswwwwiredcomstorycapitolriotgooglegeofencewarrant if thats not the source you refer edward snowden has been saying about big tech since do some quick research at least
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no far from being good do you realize that they do have their own spyware built into their more and google is not tied to the government in which fairy tale are you living
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,its sad to see phone with good spec even outperforms latest sd in some area that will never purchase due to having no freedom of rom
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei is officially the best because of the lack of gms on their phones people are trying to more no far from being good do you realize that they do have their own spyware built into their os and you cant even unlock the bootloader and flash safe rom right you will not be spied by google on huawei devices but you are spied from huawei and they are closely tied to their government meanwhile if you go to apple then you get spied by apple what essentially degoogling means that you are not spied either from the oem or google
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,thats why your name is emotions no one is talking to you
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lol samsung ui is so slow compared to oneplus its like day and night doubt you recently used any samsung device think you are talking about touchwiz one ui especially on phones since works flawlessly
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,but why up the isnt write no google service support dont blame me more where it should be written
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,first of all samsungs one ui is one of the best in the android world secondly apple more lol samsung ui is so slow compared to oneplus its like day and night
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,guys still coping in
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why does phone company love screen housing look like alien scfi
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the most overrated phones of all time the cpu is trash and the price is ridiculous you dont have to drop comment if thats what you think lol it for people that can afford it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,is now available google service because of trump years ago they will be no google services anymore for huawei unfortunately
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,flagship price performance from years agosd outperforms it make it cheaper let pe more theyre under us restrictions unfortunately
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei just gets better and better with all the issues with chips and they still managed to release flagship devices pro mid and budget phone even they wearable tablets earbuds are all good
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,honey shrunk the dslr again
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yes sumsung is better than huawei samsung phone wont last longthe most uears and problem emerge
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,im not thats why your name is emotions
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,oh my that camera design is horrible the phone is so ugly people only buy this when they have more you must be talking about yourself
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,also own huawei mate pro but dont understand it because of the chip issue and more you wouldnt get exynos at this price point the has the gen
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,you look emotional im not
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,who asked you look emotional
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,this thing has worth of camera equipment alone
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,never but why up the isnt write no google service support dont blame me just read the specifications
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,overpriced phone with low end soc have you tried using it or just hating blindly like sony fans other brands benchmarks dont show real world performance
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,better in what huawei pura has better camera better battery charing vs better more better design way better software like samsung design way more so what now way better software in what way exactly oneui is the most customizable android interface available can you change status bar icons without root on huawei can you customize volume bar to anything you like in huawei can you remove options from settings menu with no root doubt you cant do lot of things samsung can ive used both huawei and samsung love both but samsung is clearly better on software side overall camera is natural preference of course if you like instagram overexposed shots then samsung is great choice if you like more natural photos almost anything will be better than samsung camera software animations are natural preference too actually like them to be removed on all phones too think next time before attacking someone samsung is one of the best in the world for reason like said love both but sadly huawei doesnt have google anymore
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,if you like yellowish pictures and pink lines on the panel then yes the ultra is the bes more if you punch your screen hard enough all phones can have same pink lines like you described its oled issues that you described and to your knowledge all phones uses oled nowadays so your point applies to huawei as well
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lol im also long time huawei user ppppropproppro and now pro more also own huawei mate pro but dont understand it because of the chip issue and the likelihood that if the phone gets crack it may be difficult to repair it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei user for years now from huawei honorx ppro matepro ppro ppro and more lol im also long time huawei user ppppropproppro and now pro im thinking about getting ultra but im not sure about the price lol
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,who asked it was an individual
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,they wouldnt be if the us restrictions were lifted also why are you reacting with thu more because hesheit is very emotional
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,samsung galaxy ultra is better than huawei pura ultra if you like yellowish pictures and pink lines on the panel then yes the ultra is the best choice
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,excellent suoer macro mode easy install of google apps no regrets
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,youre obviously here just to hate on the phone the ultra isnt for those who more samsung is better than huawei wash your face and eyes
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,its very simple if you are not satisfied with this list of smartphones you have huawei more samsung galaxy ultra is better than huawei pura ultra
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,so its time to say bye to the gms thats your opinion
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,my draw to it is absence of google services surely am not captured by those nonsense more so its time to say bye to the gms
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,looks nice but way to smallnarrow the body should be over mm wide like good old xiaomi mi max
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the only company that can win in battle against apple kicked of the usa market and made its on phone cpu os yep usa govermant are affreid so its got kicked of the plant lol
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,retractable lens seems interesting however the cpu and the lack of google services are quite disappointing to me but the worst part has to be the price
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,jesus this comment section is more worse than android vs apple threads guys you are arguing more yes but you cannot explain this to the huaweihaters
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei fanboy you are trying so hard to defend your beloved company almost all companies sam more to be huaweifanboy is less worse than to be xiaomifanboy have no beloved company do not care about this useless talking buy always the most reliable with high quality craftmanship am talking about facts but yes with xiaomi you cannot understand what mean
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei got better technologies that other phones can beat thats why us banned huawei you know they believed the spyballon after all
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yes for people who will not play games this will be excellent the mobile itself is ama more huawei fanboy you are trying so hard to defend your beloved company almost all companies samsung apple oppo vivo google and xiaomi provide better value flagships for cheaper price than this lol
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,had more phones with the sd and they were all overheating sorry if you do not want to more snapdragon gen devices dont overheat stop lying
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,mostly you have nice old school tramway at least
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei produces beautiful devices kirin processor is still as fast as the first day after years what huawei needs to do is to make its software update policy like apple for example and mate even pmate should have received the latest emui update however huawei is very slow in updating global devices even though love their devices it would be comforting to know what the update policy is for device over euros
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,cant argue with someone whos ignorant ignorant you are talking about something but you have no proof about it so the best is not to say anything
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,identical really thanks sherlock show us the proof cant argue with someone whos ignorant
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,last years mate kirin chip was well documented disaster in china what kind of disaster tell us more we want to know
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,you just said the sd overheats so you clearly have no clue and never own phone with that more had more phones with the sd and they were all overheating sorry if you do not want to accept the truth
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,you are wrong it shows that you do not know what you are talking about thats it more do you even know that huawei makes the pro and mate pro and both phones are identical to this one at half the price
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,have fun with your overheating chip in your dollar phone the pro was overheating with the sd
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why would anyone buy phone for camera what even the point of this phone electronic waste more you are wrong it shows that you do not know what you are talking about thats it to the selling points you can add very nice screen high quality craftmanship stable clean os perfect software optimization and the last one no gogole spyware
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,could buy car with that price what kind of trash you will buy for this price
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,all of your points are very correct lets for example take the snapdragon gen that more yes for people who will not play games this will be excellent the mobile itself is amazing the photos are incredible the screen is fantastic and the optimization is as always made by huawei so everything is working smoothly only people who had huawei before can understand what mean the sammy or rottenapple fanboys will never understand and its their problem in the end
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huaweipuraseries the pura ultra is no flagship super spec phone how ever its freedo more think it has no price to be without gogol spyware
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,most people should realize if you have higher clocked cpu that doesnt mean it will perfo more all of your points are very correct lets for example take the snapdragon gen that was built on the nm process that has core running at ghz and as running at ghz despite that it actually has less points in benchmarks like geekbench which is pretty surprising the kirin meanwhile has its main big core running at ghz and other big cores at ghz while being on nm process sdg ish geekbench kirin ish geekbench the only thing huawei needs to improve is their gpus
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lool yeah but honestly they arent wrong considering the rather lower clock speed compar more most people should realize if you have higher clocked cpu that doesnt mean it will perform way better would rather have lower clock but working at with no problems instead of super high clock cpu which is struggling because of the heat in the end more stable performance will bet better in long run huawei is amazing on optimizations
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,extremely expensive one purchase one saved child from chinese labor
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lol seems like you live under rock you should do your research or ask questions we have more
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,somehow they managed to make flagship chip that runs worse than tensor very impressive still better than google that has everything but failed miserably times
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,chipset is weaker than gen had me rolling its like gen level
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,hmmm just curious why dont see anything special at all this phone is huaweis first flagship if im not mistaken its common that it has very bad quality and features for such high price but as time passes and huawei makes more flagships they will probably get better its just up to experience
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,tested displaymodel of this device it is nice but the gimmick of snapshots is totally disappointment there are times it will work and times that it is perfect overall nice device minus the featured gimmicks
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,extremely expensive
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,so to use in the eu you need to order the chinese version not fe amazon offers believe so
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yes there is no in european models from official huawei distribution channels you need to buy the chinese version it comes with native harmony os which is plus
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,can anyone confirm esim is not supported at pura ultra arent there any pura user to give an answer
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,is disabled globally and is only available in china so to use in the eu you need to order the chinese version not fe amazon offers
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,these are smic ones was talking about snapdragon chipsets
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,mostly ones with samsung nodes not tsmc ones these are smic ones
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,better than overpriced sony tech
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,this joke doesnt deserve more than euro
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,update the video recording information as this phone records on the front and rear camera at up to frames
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,because you seen paid reviewers praising this phone and you geniuenly believe its good huawei user for years now from huawei honorx ppro matepro ppro ppro and will move to matepro dont need reviews to talk about huawei
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,have you already use it before stating that many jokers her
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,basically pixel that looks better
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,using it with mint mobile had to have the hard sim
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,snapdragon chips overheat lot faster than kirin chips mostly ones with samsung nodes not tsmc ones
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why in the cons says no when in specs says it has is disabled globally and is only available in china
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,if you ever had youll never want smaller phone how do you even work with that
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,inches is small for you if you ever had youll never want smaller phone
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,imagine the price with and gms support anyway for me the only cons are small screen si more inches is small for you
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,only works in china rest of the world cannot use its chip you mean the global version of pura series right because my kirin function works even in the soviet region
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,you are joker have you ever used huawei with kirin ship no ppro with snapdragon ship more because you seen paid reviewers praising this phone and you geniuenly believe its good
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,silly have ever used the kirin chip its far better last years mate kirin chip was well documented disaster in china
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,theyll still float because theyve got serious backing hmmmi did huawei die after the ban look at the current bans the kirin is far better the tests show its slower but the perfomance is far greater
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,pro cost usd brand new this has slightly better camera and trash kirin chip for twic more silly have ever used the kirin chip its far better
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,trash kirin have you already use huawei with kirin chip many people here making revi more have fun with your overheating chip in your dollar phone
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,need esim pls
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,telephoto lens sensor size
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,this version solved the android auto issue and its working with all pura edition
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dust and moisture ingress is going to be problem with this kind of design which might lead to fungus growth can see from the close up photo of the camera that theres alot of dust surrounding the movable part of the lense
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,interesting gms without gbox please how by using the microg services you can easily download those apps in huawei appgallery
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,or town in any south asian language pura means temple
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,and they still outperform lot of chips look at the benchmark results this phone is currently number on geek bench smartphone list phones from perform better flagships at least granted the phone still runs good and the camera is lit but there are effects of the bans on huawei
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,chipset might be slower in benchmarks but comparing it side by side with sd gen phones it more interesting gms without gbox please how
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,without android huwaie is zero theyll still float because theyve got serious backing
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dxomarks scoring system could potentially be influenced by any manufacturer seeking cons more just get yourself huawei pro or something higher if the camera doesnt beat what you have on you iphone if youd be honest with yourself come back and tell me to delete this mean camera with allround details
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,bulbulitobayagbag may nm chips were released in and they still outperform lot of chips look at the benchmark results
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,have looked up the price offered here in my country and examined the specsquite mismatc more huawei smartphone are known to be durable from their first device nm chips dont impact the flagship performance you should read more on why smartphone manufacturers opt for nm this phone looks too good
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,pura means pigeon in tamil or town in any south asian language
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,did you use the phone or watched some real life tests so you know it is terrible dont more it has really improved with updates pura ultra is ahead of xiaomi ultra only vivo pro its on its level at the moment huawei is number in macro along side vivo number in bokeh number in shutter very necessary in capturing sport moments top in night number in colours the pura ultra has really improved and it keeps improving with updates
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,commercial style is original but not mine the mechanical lens seems cool not pro cool but my pop up lens hasnt failed yet ive used huaweis in my time and found with both that something was missing or they did an obvious compromise that disappoints hope them success
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,esim is listed in specs of pura pro version but not listed ultra version insane what more unbelievable esim is related with android and user interface why do they not supported all versions of pura
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,with no card slotno aptx hd or losslessno google storeno mm jackonly bluetoot more you not buying doesnt stop them progressing or stop others like my self not to buy
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,processor is terrible and very inefficient did you use the phone or watched some real life tests so you know it is terrible dont judge based on benchmarks
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,just took place on dxomark for camera not surprising every time an honor or huawei flagship is released they take the or spot
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,so most of googles services are blocked in china market of around bn users why wou more you have to do some research on who backs huawei if it was company like the ones you mentioned sanctions imposed on it would surely kill it but heres company banned in still alive in youve got to think they have some serious backers like the actual state
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,went here because of dxomark score news but got disappointed with the kirin its perfor more not surprising its built on nm chip flagships now are using nm it is waaay behind the first mainstream nm mobile processor intended for mass market use the apple bionic was released at apples september event although huawei announced its own nm processor before the apple bionic the kirin on august the apple bionic was released for public mass market use to consumers before the kirin both chips were manufactured by tsmc
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,poor huawei miss their creativity every year whenever they release their new flagship phones huawei and honor are always and but when sales are tallied its apple and samsung that dominates with xiaomi being third place huawei and honor are nowhere to be found
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,seriously is this the price of this chinese phone absurd
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,who told you no faceid nor fingerprint its packed with all features processor is terrible and very inefficient
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,ok no faceid like in honormate no ultrasonic fingesensor gg phone who told you no faceid nor fingerprint its packed with all features
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,as expected any new huawei or honor flagship always gets the ranking on dxomark when it co more dxomarks scoring system could potentially be influenced by any manufacturer seeking consultation why do you think huawei and honor get singled out for suspicion when other companies could also be paying for better rankings
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no esim esim is listed in specs of pura pro version but not listed ultra version insane whats wrong with huawei
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no the global version comes with emui the reviewers got the chinese version for review my bad it seems like they did use the emui overlay for the global versions thought it would use hyperos because thered be no point in giving the reviewers something to review that they wont actually be able to recommend or not recommend to their viewers as in its different from the final product
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,please confirm if it is capable or noti have ask their store in the philippinesthey said more chinese version is global is only
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,wrong itll be using harmonyos if it were to use emui there would be no reason to more no the global version comes with emui the reviewers got the chinese version for review
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,pura ultra will be availabe in global unde emui wrong itll be using harmonyos if it were to use emui there would be no reason to give the phone to reviewers with harmonyos on it instead of emui
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why no outside china other chinese phones have it ask dt
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei answered my question in just one day haha thought the pura global sale would be more pura ultra will be availabe in global unde emui
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,normal specs or even behind and extremely overpriced
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,is there dolby atmos inbuilt and support dolby vision videos nope they cant use the dolby stuff because of those sanctions
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no mention of it you can get android auto or banking apps on these yet without those im afrai more no android auto you can use waze or something else but the banking apps are working without any problem
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,if were talking about transfer ratedata sent rate and latency delay then ldac and lhdc are by more everything is fine until you hate samsung although you are right in some comments about this website that has become samsung advertising poster and we all know that throwing hate at brand is not good samsung is an excellent brand as is xiaomi apple huawei google nah google is not hardware company even so the pixels are not bad terminals they just need some things like real fast charging leaving aside those exynos or forcing samsung semicon to make better product for them personally loved this huawei pura ultra it is beautiful powerful phone it hurts about the sanctions but it can be deleted in minutes
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,true but cameras are not the only reason why want phone am bluetooth speakerphile more if were talking about transfer ratedata sent rate and latency delay then ldac and lhdc are by far the best specially lhdc which only couple chinese brands like oppo xiaomi and huawei sorry im if missing or more brands use they might not be the most used but definitely the best codecs also isnt aptx and all versions qualcomm technology probably why it doesnt support them takes seconds to figure that one out
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no hires audio for this price lol possibly gsm usually miss off loads of features of phones unless its pixel iphone ot galaxy phones then theyll give you every spec possible including unofficial specs did it with my huawei mate pro and pro missed out recording rates and other hardware features like air gestures on my pro aswell so this phone does probably have hi res audio kirin chips are usually the best featureset chips and were years ago actually go do some more resesrch and stop being lazy maybe again im sure huawei devices have mode which you can still use the device up to like hours after the battey is essentially deleted gsm never mention other brands unique features no idea why its like they want people to know they are biased like showing iphone unofficial charging speeds suprised they dont tell you what the phones favourite day of the month is to us this does have the best satellite communication in phone best protection glass on phone best cameras by about years than anyone else wireless reverse wireless reverse wired wired no phone touches this for all round charging speeds the best bluetooth connectivitycodecs too guess some people just like to troll or being funny for likes and attention very sad stick to your galaxy phone and go have post purchase regret somewhere else lol
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,sadly youtube is trying to take revanced down and they will succeed and revanced doesn more recommend newpipe as an alternative
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,youtube revanced requires rooted phone no no there is two version rooted and non rooted
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,its up to you if you want to use ai or not true but cameras are not the only reason why want phone am bluetooth speakerphile and bluetooth codecs are very important to me huawei pura series have only sbc aac ldac and lhc bluetooth codecs thats not enough for me vivo ultra will have sbc aac lc aptx aptx adaptive aptx hd aptx lossless ldac and lhdc bluetooth codecs vivo ultra will also have top of the best phone cameras in the world lhc bluetooth codec is useless speaker companies dont use it aptx lossless speakers are coming soon probably devialet devialet phantoms are masterpiece becoming even better hopefully asked them if they would use bluetooth with aptx lossless codec and wifi and they said noted aptx lossless bluetooth speaker masterpiece coming soon will see aptx lossless is the best bluetooth codec in the world for now
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,still no google apps skip you can you could get some working when they st had to go down this route with the pro it was difficult at times and stupidly didnt just root it as soon as got it you used ti be able to just install gms again before you updated the phone think you can still install rd party apps theres another app honestly cannot remember the name but it essentially could emulate certain things to get youtube running if you didnt want to use the web browser version which is what you had to do with some companies tbf harmonyos and the ecosystem is doint incredibly well now ane from the looks of it great competitor to android and ios especially in asia where having western operating systems and apps isnt really an issue
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yeah and huawei is slowly becoming like samsung why they say they have the best cameras bu more must be models you have used because my dads old pro didnt have this issue my matw pro didnt and my pro didnt you do know that pixels have been basically full ai in how you describe it pictures can use the pixel suite on my find have google one and its benefit so can have literally pixel photos after editing huawei and samsung were known for using fake moon shots but calling their shots ai is wrong for both of them
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,weve waited sooooooooooooooooooooooo long for huawei phone review and gsmarena has finally delivered its impressions
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,looks like huawei disabled connectivity on the global series so the delusional us government wont go apeshite over it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the price are so loud
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,anton el papi may httpswwwandroidheadlinescomglobalhuaweipuramodelscomingasexpectedhtml more huawei answered my question in just one day haha thought the pura global sale would be like the mate series
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,you cant convince me this price is acceptable with that chipset
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,kirin is backhow miss it so much
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,am buying it next week know that the name series name has been changed to pura think that the pura series like the mate will not be sold on the global market
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,think this is the end of huawei do you think anyone buy this mobile by this price am buying it next week
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the main lens on this phone is actually mm instead of mm one of the main reasons they made it retractable
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,more expensive than ultra which still is better than this abomination no this has far suprior overall hardware been this way for what maybe years atleast now even after american lawmakers have purposely tried to destroy the chinese market or atleast from the article from tomshardware have reported an american offical has basically released statement sort of going nooo we didnt want to harm them look huawei are doing well again after some huawei laptops are releasing with intel chips in httpswwwtomshardwarecomtechindustryusjustifieshuaweisintelpoweredlaptopssayingchipbansarentmeanttohobblechinasgrowth link to the site for proof its showing the price for america id be suprised if it wasnt more expensive gsmarena seem to focus on usa and european pricing on worldwide website in the uk youre looking at about for gb ram gb storage or about for the tb model samsungs website is selling the su gb storage option with gb for the tb model with gb of ram for so in the uk huawei is cheaper itll take samsung what to years to catch up in camera tech alone samsung still using the same uw since what the or have they actually updated it yet doesnt look like it lets ignore huawei were st and have the best satellite communication better charging and battery techbigger battery specially in china they usually use different battery tech the huawei is lighter with the same size screen the best glass protection on the market more storage and ram better cameras than anyone has by miles better bt connectivity and satellite positioning struggling to see win for samsung here unfortunately gsm push samsung hard still seems to be the mainstream trend also doesnt huawei have feature in which you can still use the device for about hours after the battery is essentially fully drained or did they remove that feature not too sure oh and huawei ecosystem is basically nd to non at this point gives apple run for its money how flawless all their devices work together
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,on aliexpress
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,ugliest camera setup looks like this
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,so ugly was looking for this comment we need phone whose camera is tucked inside
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,they are secretly ui is the same designs are almost the same honor suite and hisuite are exa more or it could be the fact that the employees who left for honorwere working on it when it was series of huawei devices will have taken design plans they were already using to build on for honor phones honor phones are very good they just arent huawei levels of quality im just glad they kept true secure facial recognition and keep some design philosophies from huawei devices
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lol dimensity vs snapdragon gen you seriously compare mid end phone against ult more did not compare anything
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,vivo ultra does not exist and vivo pro is ranked th on dxomark the honor more lol dimensity vs snapdragon gen you seriously compare mid end phone against ultra phones vivo pro was never meant to be against ultra phones it was made against all the pro models vivo ultra will use snapdragon gen and way better camera sensors than on vivo pro
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,honor isnt owned by huawei anymore they are secretly ui is the same designs are almost the same honor suite and hisuite are exactly the same
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,honor is one of the leading smartphone brands owned by huawei do you think they are still owned by huawei
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,come on comment rubbish on this phone yall are just apple simps thinking its the best in the world
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,this like wth is this phone would prefer iphone than this hawaii phone anm techno more guess youre loyalist to apple if im not mistaken
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,wonder if theres going to be pura art though its price would most certainly more yes art is coming soon
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,imx sensor is good but the sensor needs the soc cpu and gpu they dont use the fu more vivo ultra does not exist and vivo pro is ranked th on dxomark the honor magic pro is st for now we will see if huawei will take back the first place
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei has fallen king has fallen they are like samsung they use ai cameras rather than more you can deactivate the ai
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,kirin nm nm nm nm wtf are they joking for this garbage cheap more why are you here this phone is more interesting than the scamsungsu or the itrashpro
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,can just deactivate it have mi ultra and in my camera there is this ai onoff switch more agree you can put ai off but is hardware only enough against vivo ultra sadly huawei use weak socs blame america for that liked huawei lot and still do but camera is not the only reason why want phone need bluetooth codecs also ldac is not good enough aptx lossless is superior vivo ultra will have sbc aac lc aptx aptx adaptive aptx hd aptx lossless ldac and lhdc bluetooth codecs thats huge plus for me am huge bluetooth speaker lover and all bluetooth codecs is huge win for me
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,there are ai cameras and so called normal cameras that dont use ai at all prefere th more can just deactivate it have mi ultra and in my camera there is this ai onoff switch button and the difference it considerable better by turning it off get slighty better details but way better colours
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why only with these bezels nowadays they should make ultra models above inches
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no phone relies solely on ai or hardware every brand uses both hardware and ai huawei has im more there are ai cameras and so called normal cameras that dont use ai at all prefere the old cameras vivo will use normal camera tech ai makes mistakes like deleting details dont want to have cameras that delete details one guy also exposed samsung ai camera vs pro normal camera normal camera didnt delete details but ai camera did delete details you can search normal cameras vs ai cameras from google cameras with ai do exist vivo will use ai only pure original camera tech aka hardware only from google the main differences between an ai camera and traditional camera are in their range of capabilities the extent to which each can produce certain photographic or video recording outcomes is also an important point traditional camera without artificial intelligence capabilities is called normal camera
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no normal camera imx sensor isnt normal huawei also has way better process more imx sensor is good but the sensor needs the soc cpu and gpu they dont use the full power of cpu and gpu aka they dont use the hardware only they use ai also we all know ai looks bad professional cameras use hardware and ai huawei use ai and ai takes fake photos ai also deletes details samsung galaxy ultra ai deletes minor details like hair full hardware pictures dont delete details at all samsung galaxy ultra ai also deletes details maybe huawei pura ultra will have better photos than vivo ultra but it doesnt count because ai us fake its not original hardware is the original way vivo ultra with hardware only will defeat huawei pura ultra if we take hardware vs hardware camera battle
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei becoming the iphone of china with that high price lol
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dats some insane charging right there especially with the wireless love it when companies do so well with the wireless charging well probably be leaving wires in the future
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,totaly normal corporation capitalism and crony capitalism is too danger for me when fight more this is the most brainrot comment have ever freaking seen in this godforsaken website
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,hate flash design
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,well this appears to be itthe epitome of how cameracentric smartphones specifications should be crafted im referring to the inch type sensor with its variable aperture poised to deliver exceptional performance if samsung incorporates such specifications into their upcoming flagships paired with snapdragons nextgeneration flagship chipsets theyre bound to dominate the market the combination of the generous sensor size variable aperture and samsungs renowned image processing capabilities will undoubtedly captivate consumers additionally both samsung and apple could glean valuable insights from the huawei pura ultras stunning aesthetics and impressive specifications personally im eagerly anticipating the opportunity to review this remarkable smartphone
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,debating about this on gsmarena is crazy this is what we call freedom of speech
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,bezels are so thin thats amazing but about the chipset nanometer so unfair as of now triple more ok so buy nm
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,if huawei and xiaomi could get to us regulation with security they would be ultra competitive more its impossible
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,that seems to be cool because the bezels are so thin
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,still cant get over how huawei was banned for assumptions of spying on the united states more so you prefer to let dodgy communist government spying on your data rather than capitalism
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,still have my huawei mate pro in some ways it performs better than my samsung galaxy am not even surprised
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,intel still using nm are you saying intel is the most stupid here in real life application more still have my huawei mate pro in some ways it performs better than my samsung galaxy
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,why it is shame
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nm chipset ghz clock speed its really shame the processor is powerful despite its nm but it has excellent speed and processing abilities
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,really love huawei and if can buy that
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,drama everywhere
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,if its come with gen thats will be monster or gen
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,on the compare button you can add quick menu option of suggested comparis more great suggestion
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,those photo oriented phones are becoming too expensive just get real camera instead more which wont take appreciably better photos for the average user you wont always have it with you and it will be much more cumbersome to use dowload upload photos from
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,and now they have been throttled due to the ban the last years and set back not saying more who asked you
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,what you said everything is true the performance of soc is way way behind snapdragon and more agree with all of that the disappointment to me however is that they now sell well only in china if they had never had the bans and could compete fairly id suspect huawei would be very popular in the usa and other countries they were starting to get big right before the ban and was leading the way in above everyone else so to me its sad to see there loss of reach and hit to their hardware but yes im sure its still an amazing phone just not in the top besides the camera as they would and should be
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,these are the facts love huawei but lets not act like they are not set behind by yea more what you said everything is true the performance of soc is way way behind snapdragon and but you must remember this phone is target market is for people who like camera phone yes its true no matter how good the camera still lose to milcs camera result that also true to all phones camera not exlusive to huawei pu but for people who want compact camera this phone still attract customer while the price is little bit too high its still sold like cake in china its not top best phone but if its on camera category im pretty sure this phone is at least top or top phone on camera phone category and people who like photography is enough with this soc performance its not far away with tensor performance and pixel also has good camera and your rant is useless because huawei dont care what you think as long their phone is sell well on china mainland its sold out after minute and this is also their nd phone with soc build by only china equipment after all western sanction
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,talking like huawei has been manufacturing chips for more than decade and now they have been throttled due to the ban the last years and set back not saying im not impressed with huawei but this phone is literally not my opinion in the top best performing phones on the antunu benchmark im sure the phone is great but huawei themselves would tell you these bans are wrong because they know the ban keeps them from the best technology otherwise they wouldnt care
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,on geekbench thats worse than the snapdragon gen and thats not even the more these are the facts love huawei but lets not act like they are not set behind by years due to not being able to receive the latest technology due to the bans why huawei fan boys are literally ignoring concrete unbias data testing in this phone is kinda funny but whatever makes them feel good like disliking this comment im impressed with what huawei is actually doing achieving given their unfortunate circumstances but see the product for what it is not what you wish it to be
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yes you are true but it looks it will have the same technology like the art it should ha more wonder if theres going to be pura art though its price would most certainly scare any potential buyers
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,on th of may where did you get this info
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,wired it seems they didnt care about battery life yes you are true but it looks it will have the same technology like the art it should have longer lifetime
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,is there information if it will be available in europe on th of may
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,retractable lens is crazy first tecno with their phantom pro which was already pretty goo more the retractable lens on the pura ultra only serves purpose of making the camera bump more compact when it isnt sticking out and also probably to have gimmick to make people buy the most expensive edition
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dont know dont care had mate pro now got an probably will buy vivo more you cant call xiaomi vivo or huawei different companies they are all under the grip of the chinese government they being different entities is just to promote internal competition
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the us sanction really make great impact on huawei
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,mad will buy in euro old technology processor now world moving on gen its even not better then sd
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,its not just trump its the whole us to be exact if not why think samsung cannot sell uni more fun fact there are exynos phones in the us not sure why you think otherwise and come to mind
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dude you good think hes stuck in the past
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,without sd card and audio jack its doa go buy portable ssd
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,lucakirani look it up not my opinion you can disagree with facts all you want to your own more darlingyext lucakirani ultra huawei fanboys heres your direct link httpsnanoreviewnetenphonelistantuturating
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,geek bench pura at mate pro at lucakirani look it up not my opinion you can disagree with facts all you want to your own irrationality
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,what is max framerate of hdr
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,performance of this phone doesnt even break the top on the antunu benchmarks
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,noooo lol the mate pro processor is better geek bench pura at mate pro at
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,with gbtb storage you are still complaining of sd card go and manufacture it yourself people are complaining too much the space its ok
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,iqoo have watts years ago iqoo has watts man httpswwwgsmarenacomvivoiqoozphp
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nm in nm in nm in and they started with zero this is huge leap foward nm may come this year with mate series but nm no guaranty with quadruple patterning nm is possible this year though production cost is high but with the current duv machine dont think nm possible huawei is trying hard to make own euv machine
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,core processador note octa core best mobile
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yes but its better than sdg noooo lol the mate pro processor is better
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nm in nm in nm in and they started with zero this is huge leap fowa more we will see if they can access to it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the pure paranoia from the us government is the cause for huaweis ban yes we are still waiting the proof
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nope the xiaomi ultra did it first honor magic pro and xiaomi mix have wireless
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,does anyone what sensor the ultrawide and telephoto cameras use
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,processor could have been better yes but its better than sdg
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,when the mate series was new really did not notice that
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei made standalone storage standard the nano sd card and doesnt even use it in their own phones brilliant
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,how does huawei smartphones blend with android phones in the world of mobiles phone now
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the huawei annual sales report shows that it sells other world markets not only china but it more because nobody wants their below average and insanely overpriced nova and nova series nobody would pay eur for snapdragon powered phone their flagships could sell but they dont sell them
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,xiaomi sells everywhere but in the us while huawei is pretty much china only at this point the huawei annual sales report shows that it sells other world markets not only china but it does unsuccessfully
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the processor is rubbish
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,but xiaomi dont sell phones in usa too but its number in the world where is hua more xiaomi sells everywhere but in the us while huawei is pretty much china only at this point
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,what does retractable lens do exactly it just allows the phone to be slimmer with large sensor
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,just ignore him its just another applesamsung fanboy who cant bring up another more although the typical samsungapple fanboy your refering to will usually just buy whatever is the latest and dont even use the website anyway
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,nm cpu with the highest clock at ghz huawei can overclock to match gen but think will have heat issue that why they underclock it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,finally flat flagship wish it was released internationally
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,samsung su camera small dots design xiaomi camera large tumor shaped huawei pu camera nacho shaped
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,dont think huawei will launch an ordinary phone rather after taking so much time it must be competitive launch may be huawei is playing mind game not giving full details
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,yeah its so sad to see that they still have the best cameras on any phone more they are tied with oppo and honor is above them according to dxo mark and im not saying the cameras wont be the best but thats feature most brands still do amazing at and everything else that makes smart phone they are now lacking except fast charging
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,king with nanometer cpu and optical finger print sensor pura ultra is my dream phone hope they wll release it gere or directly import from china
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the king is back king with nanometer cpu and optical finger print sensor
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,and first one from the list now dont remember when it happened last time on gsmarena when the mate series was new
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,well and the golden oscar and platinium plaket goes to huawei pura series
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,wait did they drop the support for their own nm card slot support after years or is it more as long as you can buy in chinese sim card which works as memory card this aint required anymore buying standrard sim card with or tb memory aint problem when you are in china
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,wow wireless charging think this is new record the rest of the specs are also good more bro there are hpones with even wireless charging this aint new record and is useless since wired one is always faster and does not overhead battery as much as wireless one
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,waiting for pupo aka pura porsche design anyway great specs awesome price looks marvelous samsung google apple and many else can go nuts honestly
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,on giztop
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,run away from huawei nfc and payment on major eu countries are not abailable same like on more with my ppro pay with nfc when want so dont lie
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei sells in lot of countries in europe and still they cant reach top in the world
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,does huawei sell in the us and most of europe nope so how would they be in the top global sales but xiaomi dont sell phones in usa too but its number in the world where is huawei domination
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,what an odd looking back design kinda like how it looks also that screen is downright perfect minimal edgest looks perfect and amazing
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,oh no bro thinks global means the us and europe global means everywhere huawei doesnt sell everywhere unlike the likes of samsung and apple end of story
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,well time to say goodbye to the series and hello pura series
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,what in gods own are you talking about this is flagship device go pay for your more keeping in mind the fact that its chipset performs as year old snapdragon soc and keeping in mind the lack of gms the price is indeed bit high
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,terrible price what in gods own are you talking about this is flagship device go pay for your iphone
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,sony had the exact same setup in with xperia pro sonys variable aperture is disabled no starry light and only
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,it is amazing phone will buy it
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,ok see this is good phone but the price is tooooo much also some hardware not new like cpu is important things to all device and see all people just talk about camera if you wanna good camera buy dlsr camera for ultra name think this is gaming phone but its nothing special for gaming but still for review
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the sensor with variable aperture alone already sold me to this phone this is easily more sony had the exact same setup in with xperia pro
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,really are huawei in top by sales in the world does huawei sell in the us and most of europe nope so how would they be in the top global sales
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,im bit disappointed that it doesnt have wifi and uses bluetooth instead of also does anyone know the sensors used for the telephoto and ultrawide cameras what size
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,number one in dxomark you hear it here first yeah cause they pay to dxomark had honor and huawei phones nothing special
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,they will have to release it internationally do you think they will offer only the nova an more wouldnt be surprised if they did but hopefully they do release at least the pro internationally
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,its always bad sign when company only tell size of main camera sensor but for rest telewide more it would be okay if the tele is imx since its basically the miniatuized version of the main imx camera sans the ryyb color filter the mp camera on the other hand is mystery just like last year
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,they never left the game they always kept innovating and bringing excellent cameras to their more they will have to release it internationally do you think they will offer only the nova and enjoy for europe
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,wish to own one because of the specs
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,no it previously stood for photography not theyve rebranded the series name yeah thats what thought thanks
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,the final boss of camera smartphones
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,pmate were the low point of huawei with the they recovered the mate reintroduced and was great allrounder and now this feels like the first huawei since that actually has very strong selling point while im not massive fan of how this phone looks its the only phone right now that has sensor also great battery and good charging while being reasonably thin and doesnt have that xiaomiultrastyle camera bump we see everywhere now we did have the xiaomi pro last generation but xiaomi pro now has the smaller sensor
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,either that or gsmarena is still waiting for the full specs to be unveiled the chipset is not more fair enough well wait nm or expandable storage in flagship territory is the reason that still want either huawei or sony xperia
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,so did the in the huawei and stuff stand for pura no it previously stood for photography not theyve rebranded the series name
Huawei,Pura 70 Ultra,huawei really went all in with this onesame can be said about its price
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,what chip is inside this smartphone hisilicon kirin
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,in europe already they announced that theyll have these types of bundles how much is the variant and how much is the variant and what is the bundle if may know am wondering why is there peri scope on the huawei where as theres telephoto on the ppro ppro would gladly choose the amongst the three is the persicope zoom on the better and has longer zooming range than other mentioned
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,oh well the pultra is the best option iam gonna buy the pultra once it is out and well more in europe already they announced that theyll have these types of bundles
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,camera specs are insane
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,the base pura has kirin this is apple behaviour ngl its an enhanced version
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,pro and upper models have kirin dont know about vanilia model the base pura has kirin this is apple behaviour ngl
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,huawei pura pro emui for global market kirin for the chipset
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,huawei never use microsd card slot on their flagship phones they always use their own nm ca more looks like they abandoned their nm cards
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,the difference between this and the pro is minimal the pro is just pro with added satellite communication no surprise that huawei kept the pro for their home market only since satellite communication is possible in china
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro,no microsd slot no deal huawei never use microsd card slot on their flagship phones they always use their own nm card slot although it has been absent since the mate series
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,great mobile
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,couldnt be further away from the truth under display fingerprint scanners are far more more and whole pura line up had underdisplay scanners so this is sever downgrade only dont like in my pura that its located too low they should have been move it up bit and thats its but side and back mounted are definitely no go
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,quite the opposite for me as sweaty fingers wont even register in underdisplay fingerpri more sidemounted scanners are two narrow so unreliable let alone that you cant use them comfortably while phone is on the table because there is no space to move finger down enough you have to pick up the phone into your hand very inconvenient had back side front and underdisplay scanners and lack of underdisplay scanner is totally red flag for me now they are by far more convenient
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,any huawei fans here im user of huawei pro and im huge fan of huawei but unfortunately my budget isnt quite matching my enthusiasm because work on daily wages bruh but love huawei and still admire their innovation and tech
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,never know what the tech giant is preparing besides the underdisplay fingerprint it also just got invented so it aint that superior
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,indisplay fingerprints symbol of flagship devices and side mounted fingerprint is symbol for local companies very very disappointed
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,liked this model and the pro model too the only thing im curious about is the size of telephoto sensors
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,scanner better exposed then behind thick strong glass makes scanning your fingerprints more couldnt be further away from the truth under display fingerprint scanners are far more reliable than side mounted ones ive used both in many different smartphones and under display sensors hardly ever underperformed whereas side mounted scanners had me attempting to unlock the phone until would block it and know plenty of people whove had similar experiences
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,do wonder why huawei is moving away from under display fingerprint scanners and putting side more scanner better exposed then behind thick strong glass makes scanning your fingerprints far more accurate
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,fail to understand why is the company is not seriously open if the kind shall be used worldwide
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,up the price euro much looking good
Huawei,Pura 80 Pro+,seems impressive but waiting for the mate
Huawei,Pura 80,huawei just make an one with this configuration whee you can add an port not more well said bro its time now for to up to mobile even tecno should consider that
Huawei,Pura 80,the nonpro model is the only beautiful model in this years lineup and possibly the one most worth buying
Huawei,Pura 80,usb in amazing configuration
Huawei,Pura 80,ultra and pro models features strong focus on camera capabilities particularly with its advanced zoom system and ultra chroma xmage camera
Huawei,Pura 80,why duplicate the apple camera layout surely there are other ways to stand out little more than the apple design
Huawei,Pura 80,its lowest price its priced lower than the iphone gb in my country
Huawei,Pura 80,side mounted finger print is this joke this is such stupid complaint
Huawei,Pura 80,usb thats insane own pura and this one has usb get that the ecosystem is pretty useful regarding wireless file transfers that dont need to plug cable anymore but what about the wired display weird move by huawei since this is model from flagship line
Huawei,Pura 80,usb and display port thats amazing if huawei make this budget price will be soo happy more its lowest price
Huawei,Pura 80,think it might be typo the previous pura was gen so dont think they would more unfortunately its not typo huawei site specs states usb and explicitly states no video output so this is quite critical downgrade when high end devices already should have usb by now pura also has better main camera lens
Huawei,Pura 80,thanks to pura we can read payperfeeds before everybody
Huawei,Pura 80,still using ye olde arm cores yawn next
Huawei,Pura 80,your wrong the pro has mp periscope with bigger aperture and can also do tele micro more but both are stated as having only tele photo here in this web site dude personally prefer periscope at that price but it seem not
Huawei,Pura 80,usb typec yet displayport surely that must be typo since displayport cant more think it might be typo the previous pura was gen so dont think they would go backwards
Huawei,Pura 80,this periscope seems more interesting than the one in the ppro ppro as the other more your wrong the pro has mp periscope with bigger aperture and can also do tele micros from specifications
Huawei,Pura 80,at pretty heavy for the vanilla phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it is difficult to believe that your reviews dont include gbox utility review that lives on the phone for the ones that need google it is amazing since got handme down lite with no google was the first time realized how less spam received how less times have to have updates how less data must use compared to samsung pro my life does not revolve around google but when need my gmail it works when need apps that are stuck with android it works
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,really nice price for sub screen and photos that look average zoom in and watch the terrible ai processing also this has to be one of the ugliest phones have ever seen dont own it and still feel disappointed
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,oh please dont speak as if you know the whole market huawei is still huge brand in more but thats what the guy said lol nobody pays attention to huawei phones outside asia that is fact as all countries in the west are depending on google in asia not so much especially russia and china they can live without google services because they have other alternatives since forever
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,im wondering if this phone is worth it or not also own ultra and im interested to buy this as want something different im kinda bored with sammy but their os remains one of the best if not the best dont like the fact that huawei doesnt offer any details on how many os updates it will receive their way of selling products is shady
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it is nice to have options but majority of people use phone camera in defaultauto mode majo more this is not the same as using manual mode like youre handling dslrmirrorless camera these settings can pretty much be treated as setitandforgetit lower the sharpening lower the saturation lower the brightness and get more natural shots than with the default mode even though its more natural and better looking than most other phones you still benefit from less sharpening especially since you can use the lens profiles which massively affect the entire photo look and its not just simple filter now tell me this why would scientific test not mention or test any of this but they test ridiculous fake bokeh mode why should it cater to the lowest common denominator an average consumer especially when talking about high end devices just because most people are noobs doesnt mean we should disregard progress and improvement just imagine car testreview that never tests acceleration simply based on the premise that most people will never use car like that if the manufacturer provided an option especially to improve user experience it should be tested on serious testreview but that wasnt my main point of argument anyway it was to show the flaws of dxomark testing and their inconsistencies
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,wrote long comment which is still under review from gsmarena before it gets posted so it more it is nice to have options but majority of people use phone camera in defaultauto mode majority of people are not photographers when they want to take shot they want to take phone out and take the photo not think which settings should use for best results you might disagree would disagree as well few years ago but people are lazy found that out on browsers when everyone was recommending brave for adblocking when you can get the same thing on for example firefoxor almost any other browser with clicks installing or extensions that is apparently considered too much work clicks once and then you dont have to worry about it until you reinstall os or browser now you are talking about changing settings pretty much every time you want to take the shot you crazy dxomark is perfectly fine ranking system for regular users just because it can take better pictures with tweaking does not mean it will to make tweaking parameters worth it users need to know what they are doing and as said most are not photographers so their tweaks might make it better might make it worse
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei camera idiosyncrasies are really dumb on the pura ultra theres mp mode thats more detailed than both the mp and the mp mode which actually looks pretty bad the problem is the mp mode is fully automatic and wanted to shoot with my own settings was almost ready to settle for the mp in manual and the raws look fine but the jpgs in manual mode look horrible so was fed up and just returned it its like the camera app is developed by different teams that never talk to each other seeing how bad how bad the ultra zoom camera pictures look despite having such big sensor imagine its still much the same but they probably still have the mp mode you might want to try it next time
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,confirmed huawei hater vivo ultra doesnt win huawei in all areas would say more confirmed huawei hater confirmed how by your standard then im hater of honor sony apple samsung google etc too no buddy thats not how it works simply hate bad business practices false pretenses and fanboys btw huawei always lead in camera technologies new tech is cool but only when its useful when its useless or implemented poorly its irrelevant switchable lens system utilizes cropped sensor with slower lens which is even worse than simply cropping the sensor using isz in sensor zoom pair that with abysmal processing and no wonder you get bad results initially we think you are vivo fan again with the labels dont understand how some people have that mindset as if life was football match im fan of good products dont care about companies most people in china bought huawei not because of phone but hon mong system good but this is review of product outside of china and we in europe have no use for that
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,not just vivo ultra but ultra oppo ultra xiaomi ultra maybe some others as more confirmed huawei hater vivo ultra doesnt win huawei in all areas would say initially we think you are vivo fan but when you bring in oppo xiaomi everyone knows your true colour btw huawei always lead in camera technologies most people in china bought huawei not because of phone but hon mong system which links lot of things effortlessly including ev
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it also does not support connectivity outside of china due to longstanding ban that prevents huawei from developing modem for use internationally whod want to buy new phone that has no support these days
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,when will be available in india desperate to buy it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,dont even know why are you trying to prove so much that vivo ultra is better it more not just vivo ultra but ultra oppo ultra xiaomi ultra maybe some others as well huawei does well beating the handicapped cameras from samsung google and apple however people seem to think thats enough to call it camera king im just tired of reading paid reviews and readingwatching tech illiterate people claiming nonsense
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it does have modem only for chinese users
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,dont listen youtube boys take it from someone whos actually using the phone this phone performs better than apple series and pixel pro xl
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,dxomark took thousands of pictures before ranking statistically majority win instead of sele more just watched this video carefully vivo absolutely destroys huawei in resolutiondetails just to mention few things from the video to not go into it too deep zoom test which was controversial in some arguments zoom vivo is simply better even though dont like that its so sharp but we can tune sharpening in auto mode which is blessing that no other manufacturer gives us just set it to and you get even more natural photos that no other phone can match while having organic textures and details he says huawei is better unless the subtitles are wrong while it looks completely fake in the water and foliage its oversharpened and details appear as worms with dark ringing effect around edges for the rest of the video its self explanatory colors and white balance come down to personal preference but in the actual detail processing huawei is still years behind with only the occasional shot in between that looks good and natural then we continue to macro huawei can get really close with its minimum focus distance on tele lens which is great feature but it still loses due to superior processing on vivo its relatively close but again vivo has more details and looks less artificial im sad he only showed crops from ultrawide in low light but not telephoto lens but we already know what that would look like you can see it on gsmarena video and front camera are not that interesting to me so will skip talking about it did notice huawei having less noise and good details in low light tele video so thats good so what did exactly did you want to prove with this video except proving my point
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,couldnt be more happier with my pura ultra upgraded from su
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,apparently cant verify on the average dad channel on youtube is presented method more this is with microg so it is native
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,definitely good points made another issue is the huawei shots during the day are taken in ove more true that also needs to be considered but this is still daytime shot at minimum iso and you can get proper feeling for the processing iq the huawei shot is complete fail there
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,could spend hours analyzing their review but its not worth the time heres just more definitely good points made another issue is the huawei shots during the day are taken in overcast conditions and the brick work is not sun facing its hard for any review sure to actually be objective when the weather conditions affect the image results
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,they should name this ultra or huawei ultra trust me it will sell heck lot
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,untrustworthy you can rely on the data as the data cant be wrong but dxo are shady they more yeah guess thats better name for it didnt mean data cant be trusted but they cant be trusted not to cherry pick data and cant be trusted to provide accurate assessment of that data
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,taking shillmark seriously in big the worst thing about that is when someone uses appeal to authority logical fallacy even when presented with facts that prove that dxomark isnt reliable
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,just when thought the pu camera island was too big it still got bigger with the pu whic more once regretted buying pieces of huawei pultra with each costing euros but then changed my mind and there was once when wished the hua wei ultra back design was the huawei ultra one but come to think of it huawei pultra back design looks more premium some how and look ing forward to huawei to refrain from using ceramic and vegan leather for its back as it will be expensive too as the latter might not survive weartear after some time the ip might make things worse so prefer glass or metal preferrably plastic of high quality as it could prevent dents and easier and also cheap er to replace and an expert would nt be needed and it could pro bably last more than decade so will be waiting for the for the hua wei pultra or pultra for an sic battery digital video recording ll be waiting for the honor to replace my infinix zero ultra as my primary phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,said wont continue but its too good to pass up lol heres comparison more taking shillmark seriously in big
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,when it come to europe coming in croatia thanks
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,think they are all on similar level overall it depends and varies lot from shot to shot more could spend hours analyzing their review but its not worth the time heres just another sample to get my point across httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostmmseinemuseumhuaweipuraultradxomarkjpg httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostmmseinemuseumvivoxultradxomarkjpg first of all again they posted blurry shot for vivo motion blur second they rate huawei higher for zoom and say some sharp details at long range of zoom ratio and for vivo they write some more details lost for longer zoom ratio objectively looking huawei photo is worse here its more oversharpened and has more artifacts and fake looking textures vivo has better details on the sculptures around the clock and the clock itself roof tiles are better preserved foliage looks more realistic almost everywhere water looks more realistic and the poles in the water have better texture on top of all that you can tweak the auto mode on vivo for reducing the sharpening and getting even more natural results lets not talk about that huawei gets only one point less than vivo in ultrawide even though theres massive difference in qualitydetails even in good light to not drag this on even more you can tell im mobile camera enthusiast just think if people start to care more about this and push manufacturers to do better we could all benefit
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,im not putting them on trial dont need evidence for anything but its eit more think they are all on similar level overall it depends and varies lot from shot to shot take this example for instance huawei looks far stronger than vivo in my opinion huawei httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostneondotsdragonydxomarkpjpg vivo httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostneondotsvivoxultradxomarkjpg
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,from vivo xiaomi you dont buy we buy be my guest nobody is stopping you from spending your money in any way you like im just tired of empty hyping and misinformation understand that an average user doesnt notice or doesnt care about all these technicalities but serious reviewers should especially ones that consider themselves relevant its all very important information that everyone should be aware of dont understand why is it so hard to accept faults and admit that something is not as good as its being advertised
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,eh what is the issue with huaweis image here actually think it looks sharper but fee more up is huawei down is vivo do really need to spell it out httpsibbcogzbfbmk httpsibbconqthvt feel like such huge difference in processing should be mentioned on test by this industry leading company even during the day its obvious huawei is oversharpened and denoised to make it look like water painting plus all the artifacts and aliasing full res option is completely useless because its filled with artifacts dont see why anyone would want to spend money on this phone when the only supposed advantage camera is not an advantage at all
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no rd parties software in review do people actually use harmonyos
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,see people and gsmarena being bothered by the chip performance while on pixel phones which will have to work years according to their updates they give scores like while being the same or worst see pixel pro antutu score not having google apps doesnt mean is worse phone just different os which work flawlessly in my opinion ya very biased review based on preference not capabilities
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,why is it everyone seems to think its all paid reviews and down to money have you actually got evidence of this seriously get life youre all really sad
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,now hpu is number on dxo chart its not its just dxo
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,love this phone please bring pura pro review its the one most people can afford
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this is correct india has something like million feature phone users they simply can more we know you are talking about redmi note devices its okay to name them
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,is the bootloader unlockable or else no buy if it was unlockable id have picked up the pro back when ended up buying ultra
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,once regretted buying pieces of huawei pultra with each costing euros but then cha more your comment is incoherent what are you trying to say
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei used lot of mediatek chips in with seemingly no problems they then sued mediate more mediatek did not supply any chips to huawei after the supply restrictions which only came into effect on september th before that date they could supply huawei with chips they applied for license to supply them but didnt get permission the patent infringement is completely separate matter httpswwwreuterscomarticletechnologytaiwansmediatekpushesforpermissiontosupplyhuaweiafteruscurbsiduskbnosz
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,np bro also had and its also amazing even managed to play some ps games with stable fr more hey brur wanted to buy that back then but was still doubting huawei until the ban took place and so brur what the maximum video zoom for both optical and digital for ur huawei pro here is my experience hua wei pro has maximum of for picture taking has maximum of for video recording hua wei pro has maximum of for picture taking and has maximum of for video recording maximum of optical zoom for video recording hua wei ultra has maximum of for picture taking and has maximum of for video recording
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,please go back to the previous camera testing scenarios there were far more reference points than the scenarios you use nowtheyre all the same the quality of each camera wasnt similar please backtrack
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,hey bro thanks for the opinion and in sight and am planning to buy it until it further depr more np bro also had and its also amazing even managed to play some ps games with stable framerate camera is still decent but pro is even better even tho its smaller than which is still the best screen phone lol
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,completely useless technology that doesnt work is garbage by definition
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,thats nonsense mediatek is not allowed to supply huawei with chips or any chips for more huawei used lot of mediatek chips in with seemingly no problems they then sued mediatek for patent infringement in suppose that started earlier but yeah its part of the reason that they do not have that opportunity anymore
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it costs the same as sfe and splus in many region so whats your point why is it more in germany it costs that gets you most ultra phones which are simply superior also thermals can be fixed with updates that might have already happened dont know the flaws of this phone theyre here to stay
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,still best phone from huawei is only mate and version nothing else
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,more people doesnt mean better people in the west have more purchasing power and thus are lik more this is correct india has something like million feature phone users they simply cant afford smartphones this is why we see rebadges and renamed models on what we call ewaste released every week in india by dozen companies they all want to release bargain priced smart phone to capture that market segment this notion can be extrapolated throughout asia
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this is huawei they invented this is simply false they were among many companies that were early donors to us and uk research teams south korea was the first country to roll out and when they did it the equipment was from samsung ericsson and nokia although lg used some huawei but by no means did huawei invent
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei is no longer competitor even to budget indian manufacturers and the design of the ca more if they are indeed disgusting then why arent they even able to compete with disgusting camera designs dude what if they decided to design better ones guys wouldnt have any chance at all dude once wanted to buy micromax but my friend advised me not to and im glad didnt buy it or will be disgusted
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,in the following image httpswwwgsmarenacomhuaweipuraultrareviewpphpimage one can clearly see that the pura ultra does multiframe stacking images even in super bright daylight conditions now this photo shows image stacking gone wrong as the algorithms dont exactely fuse the parts togetther that have moved during the interframe interval of the multishot usually multiframe shots are good to improve dr in extremely contrasty images or to improve noise in dimly lit high isoconditions sind none of these reasons applies to this photo in question wonder why huawei feels to need to always do image stacking even when theres no tangible benefit from it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,what crappy phone nobody outside asia will want this phone even for free then why did you read this
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,depends on the price ive bought it for less than and it was amazing for its money hey bro thanks for the opinion and in sight and am planning to buy it until it further depreciates in price so ur simple and yet straight forward opinion has been crucial deciding factor for me bro
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,cons no google mobile services and some apps still wont work despite available workarounds midrange chipset performance with heavy thermal throttling no display brightness is behind the competition no underdisplay fingerprint reader no hd or hdr video streaming on popular platforms battery life is below average video recording quality in good light could be better so many cons but yet still got how it come
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,they had the chance to take deal with mediatek as far as know and declined they were able more thats nonsense mediatek is not allowed to supply huawei with chips or any chips for that matter without license from the us as mediatek use us technology mediatek did not receive license httpswwwblackviewhkblogtechnewsmediateknotapprovedtosupplytohuawei
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,as ive said many times before anyone who tries to defy the almighty us of america will be crushed
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it costs fracture of what current huawei phone costs while still being faster if you sa more it costs the same as sfe and splus in many region so whats your point why is it rating better even though is burning furnace huawei is better than it in every other area dont know how gsmarena do their rating and believe price should not be metric for rating we customers can see price using price gives these reviewers advantages to give unfair points like they did to also if rating based on price was thing then no foldable phone should cross point rating
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,only read huawei review comments for the political hot takes im never disappointed its the same people bickering every time
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this huawei pura is it on transition just like infinix and tecno honestly know more it will be available soon
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,is it still worth buying the huawei ppro as im interesting in it bro your opi more depends on the price ive bought it for less than and it was amazing for its money
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,asia population is almost billion while north america europe doesnt even reach more said an expert in economy and someone who knows how gigantic tech company should work
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,then in which world poco fs rating is fair only good thing that has is the soc more it costs fracture of what current huawei phone costs while still being faster if you say the soc it uses isnt that good what does that say about the chip huawei uses in their device at that price point making sacrifices is normal but not at the absurd price huawei asks for this phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the seems fair in what sense that they have it harder compared to the rest which is how more then in which world poco fs rating is fair only good thing that has is the soc which isnt even that good big battery but endurance like mah crappy camera hot as while under load
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,rating should always be based on performance taking price here would complicate things thi more the only class leading thing here is overhyping mediocrity
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,its weird that their own last years has better performance and stability than this more is it still worth buying the huawei ppro as im interesting in it bro your opinion will be highly appreciated and could be decision for me in buying
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,am just asking for my curiosity guys you know very well that huawei phone dont access playstore of any google software
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,deleted post sometimes this site has lag in putting the text after pressing submit and of if you pressing twice it will put the comment times
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,why buy if nothing works out of the box did see how many negatives this phone got nobody more the same goes to the people who do nt care about dude
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,why does last years pura ultra has better quality cameras at all focal lengths when you more well isnt it good news for all the hua wei ultra including me secondly if the pultra has better camera then who would be buying their remaining pultra stock man
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so now everyones just giving gas on the camera and gave up on other areas such as battery display etc
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,sorry but what is it even day photos look like oil paintings pura ultra had better images at mp than this one at mp hows it possible
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,but huawei can offer decent prices which they dont they choose to ask for flagship pri more bro if you are really that cleverhas vision of leader may be it would be wise of you manage huawei we shall see whether you live by ur words is self made leader and so when can we all have the honor to see it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei is banned from using american technology dont see how deal with mediatek wo more this is huawei they invented
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,how about payment support most android user get used to googlepay how many appgallery more huawei pay and xiaomi pay are the chinese equivalents of google wallet and they work the same way on both phones and smartwatches the real issue is limited app support which is less about the apps themselves and more about service providers choosing not to use the platform for instance while you can pay with xiaomi pay in the eu getting the uber app to function on huawei device without google services is another story given that uber is an american company highly doubt an app will be developed for harmonyos next
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,name single android feature you need that isnt implemented in emui its more how about payment support most android user get used to googlepay how many appgallery on emui have last time heard around kish compared to google millions obviously yeah we dont use all those apps but is still pretty limited if we compare to googleplaystore even apple have mill for gamer probably many games not supported also
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,bulbulitobayagbag aug the huawei pura ultra global version stuck on android very few ai features most more name single android feature you need that isnt implemented in emui its just your country here in ru every single bank store payment system is present in appgallery
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the huawei pura ultra global version stuck on android very few ai features most updates are just security patches based on owners of pura ultra who have said on official huawei fb groups emui is far behind its harmonyos counterpart in china gbox will drain the battery faster compared to using native apps no most local banks are still not available on the huawei app gallery the cameras on this are an absolute beast but dont think cameras alone would make me want to purchase phone that costs this much maybe if you are into professional photography but at that price shouldnt you be buying professional camera instead its like buying brand new top of the line car but it doesnt come with wheels or the battery the value is not just there have used huawei before and my experience was pleasant pre us ban they have excellent after sales service centers as well
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,good photos is this joke terrible watercolor especially on resizes mpix mpix
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,they cant because they had to develop entire chain of new production lines they inves more they had the chance to take deal with mediatek as far as know and declined they were able to have both aswell as fast efficient chips they only have themselves to blame besides huawei seems to expect people to pay those prices for products that arent remotely worth it no matter how youd twist it the value is not there
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,mean when the expectation is actually high from brand like huawei understand the frustr more the seems fair in what sense that they have it harder compared to the rest which is how this should be ranked is too much
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no the soc alone is not enough for that score it performs poorly in several places mean when the expectation is actually high from brand like huawei understand the frustration but when you think clearly the score does seem fair
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,not even with elite inside this would deserve higher score poor endurance overheat more lame chinese phones are getting all the time this has bad sides but still under would be wrong scoring thats just how feel
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,not word about whether any or all of these cameras can create panoramas an incomplete revie more even phone from have panorama mode and it is smartphones portable size and various functions outweight traditional camera though cameras bokeh is much more adorable
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,own both xu and purau took over pictures with it including astrophotography and more let me guess you base it on jpeg instead of dng and not using same settings
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,thats outside of huaweis control so you cant point fingers at them but at more but huawei can offer decent prices which they dont they choose to ask for flagship prices despite underdelivering in several ways that just isnt worth it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the xiaomi ultra just might be the best blend of camera greatness and google compatibility it may very well be the best cameraphone today without the need for further qualifiers but things are never that simple uhum simple nope the iq from the ultra isnt match for the ultra only advantage is the xmm main sensor but no teleconverter like the vivo uwa is also not up to the task lets see what the ultra brings to the tableand btw only the vivo and nubia series feature mmgo figure silly ultra wide lenses arent normal every photographer does now
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,they mention the sensorcrop several times maybe you should read better overall the phone is more im talking about how the mm lens is actually using crop on the sensor to achieve that number effectively reducing the useful sensor area down to sensor there just isnt enough of volume difference to explain how theyd even get mm equivalent lens to fully cover sensor in such form factor
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,soc is the reason its good soc would give this rating dont you think is too much is the best they can pull it emui is hampering all the experience harmony os next is another story is where the chipset shows their muscle
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so it has same power as legendary snap but way less stability and in
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,while the pura ultras photo looks alright it seems to have excessive exposure the mptomp downscaled photo looks more pleasing and more natural to my eyes as for the zoom camera its fine but ive seen better the chipset throttling however is real shocker surely not the pura ultra performed much better at this point id think very seriously about geting secondhand pura ultra instead of this new phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,really slow chipset that still throttles paired with the lack of display brightness or more thats outside of huaweis control so you cant point fingers at them but at the trump administration
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,thank you team keep it up review pura pro as well its the best seller lol for those who want to buy this dont care bout haters its better than pm
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,poor image quality with very artificial looking details abysmal performance and cpu throttled to of its max performance unnecessary big camera island and high asked price very uninteresting phone imo
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,they will be changing opinion as soon as pro max and ultra comes with zoom system inste more from what know they theyll call it good if its implemented well if its implemented horribly why act as if its good
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,understand their google and soc situation but what about proper optimization whats up with the battery life and thermals and the camera processing appreciate their effort but this aint it thank next
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so the bettwr fp sensor is now con tsk anyhow this phone only makes sense for the ca more same here prefer side mounted ones any day especially because due to my skin issue those work fine compared to both under display tech ones
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,very poor battery life camera performance is not that spectacular design is kinda bad
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,only problem the temperature old soc that still uses bt and is weaker than even upcomi more soc is the reason its good soc would give this rating dont you think
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so was right the lens shifting high zoom is gimmick waste of tech and part which would go bad if you actually misuse it or drop it also the continuous shift may harm the original lens too guess mp shot at and then crop it to will give you better result given how big that sensor is
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,overpriced midranger phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,unfortunately its all hype and nothing much to show for it the vivo ultra gets sur more funny story the chinese version of harmony os the called next is massively different than the global one it shows that the difference is so much that emui is clearly obsolete with the texh used on huawei the solution is simple but big move on harmony os next and leave emui once at all
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the most important specs for the image quality of distant objects are pixels per angle effec more how about huawei ppro and the huawei ppro bro
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it makes absolutely no sense to buy this phone especially at this price vivo oppo and xiaomi more waited as well and in main cam videography and native focal length telephoto videography this phones actually better than the vivo in lot of instances vincent zhong on yt did vid on the pura ultra and showed it but in most instances the vivo is either similar to or better but still whats funny is that people are defending this phone despite its flaws like what are they even defending lol the pura ultra was competent photography cameraphone last year but the competition has leapt ahead of huawei and huawei just took small step forward it seems or maybe they took steps forward with the hardware and somehow took steps back with their processing something has gone wrong hope they fix it soon enough cus this is embarrassing
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,lens switching is horrible gimmick dont think so it just needs to be implemented more maybe we dont know for sure literally said it hasnt been done well or something here idk if you can read or not the idea of switchable lens is novel but if it doesnt even provide any benefits whats the point im gonna complain about the phone if it has problem the telephoto is absolutely mid at longer range zooms and people deserve to complain about it especially when the phone has nothing much else going for it apart from cameras when the cameras arent even that good what even is the point of this phone look at bens gadget reviews comparison between this and the ultra you just dont make sense so do phones just dont deserve to have any complaints if they tick certain number of boxes or something ofc not youre supposed to point out flaws if there are any why should you hide em if the phone does something exceptionally well or has exceptional value then flaws can be forgiven but they should still be mentioned or maybe its my fault for not having horrendous tastes in phones and for having brain ig sorry about that
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,start by saying that in my opinion this phone makes little sense in its international version since it does not have the new proprietary os harmonyos installed but rather the old emui still based on android which although it allows the installation of apps via apk unlike harmonyos is still less optimized and has several limitations compared to huaweis proprietary and independent software if we also consider the soc which despite huawei always optimizing its software to the max is still limiting seeing the price its not worth it hope in the coming years to be able to buy huawei here in europe without such compromises
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,wheres oneplus review
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,even the chinese probably wont want to buy this thing dont know how you got it with these cons maybe it has nice box
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,pros and cons but you still gave it this isnt samsung phone jk it should be scored at most
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,whats the total optical zoom digital zoom for video recording on this huawei pultra am eager to try if it has an at least digital on video recording
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,let us again clear up misunderstanding there are no inch sensor it us called inch type sensor as the sensor does not actually measure inch also that performance barely beats other midrange devices but huawei is asking full flagship price
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this review shows that this device is very disappointing very poor battery life an amoled screen worthy of model and an average zoom huawei has accustomed us to much better
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,if youre going to charge top dollareuropounds for your handset sony then at least ha more this works exactly same way of iii but it has holes where light comes in while sony uses one anything between is digital zoom
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no mentions of the mm using crop on the sensor whether in the specs part or in the more they mention the sensorcrop several times maybe you should read better overall the phone is alright but the price is too much in my eyes
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,based on android google ended security update support for android on march
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,heater pro max china will surpass usa in every way when huawei chips surpass apple without western tech from now on
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,will the day come when we find review below
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,how many things against
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,lets goo
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,indonesia release confirmed unlike the google pixel will not support harmonyos unfortunately
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this phone will be released here in weeks time and just as fore saw that it ll be coming with huawei gt watch as one of the few bonuses can live with mah lipo battery but would buy it if it can zoom up to at least digital zoom so does anyone here know exact ly about the total digital zoom it has
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,roberto jun im buying huawei bro you may go bust nut on your antutu and geekbench scores the cam more what cope you mean from the fanboys lol fyi this is great camera system but its not up to western standards as phone mainstream will ignore it and buy mostly those three brands you mentioned nobody is saying samsung apple or pixel has the best camera results in the while world but they are the safest choice for most people what cope from the fanboys sure phone is so much more then numbers in specs sheet its the experience and it depends lot on our preference some people likes more saturation some more hdr etc but the real question is availlabilty and warranty terms many brands are offering their flagships globally and they are safe to buy from the mainstream prospective some people expect others are willing to change things just to have an option to use some of google services just to have the best camera on phone who would do that only geeks not the mainstream population those three brands you are against so much are not perfect in any way but they are perfect for people that dont know sht about phones they are buying the brand and what it represents they dont know the details like some of you geeks know for the mainstream there will always be just or choices because they dont want to experiment or risk their investing on stuff from alli express google services are part of what mainstream wants and need they are not some techy savy users they have other passions phones are their passion just tool maybe you dont like it and cant live without but majority of people cant
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,kirin is too weak for go buy samsung
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,and thought pixel had horrible design this and pixel have great design you have no taste vri
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,nothing they just needed anything to criticize
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so this seems like decent comeback from huawei however in china not in global if youre in eu sux for you updates still suk it doesnt even mention how many will be in the future it doesnt mention what base of aospse linux this is based upon and they mentioned sideloading isnt allowed anymore nice camera that looks like phone you wont be allowed to use banking apps also odd that they dont mention the cameras doing fps on frontback the selfie camera is notoriously not doing fps on huawei flagship models since sensors seem old and just improved ai processing also the specs on that cpuwhat is this samsung competitor or the crown jewel from huawei my kirin can wipe the floor with that and that has years now unless huawei ups their game for global markets they might as well just remain exclusive in china
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,cant buy this in your country fly to dubai fly back buy this in dubai more this has to be joke right buying this garbage for lol even the msrp is way too much for what it offers
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,gsmarena itself is behind of huawei hates how much you trust this european website they more that just sounds ridiculous if western reviewer rates device poorly because it doesnt work optimally in western region why is it considered hate or cheating why are you even reading the review then the fact is that the device has too many drawbacks to even be considered buying in europe especially for the price and that has nothing to do with this european website
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,nm hahahaha maybe snapdragon give you hyperthreading
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,without using them now you became bit better watch chinese review sources instead like more in this argument was focusing purely on the camera but no problem we can talk other things as well im sure huawei did well to optimize the software but still performance battery overheating issues is all worse than competition as few of these tests and reviews suggest im happy if you can prove me wrong with an independent test with all that in mind props to huawei succeeding despite the ban but there is no way they can expect people to pay this kind of money for device with so many shortcomings back to the camera there is reason why dont take most reviews especially on social media too seriously because either they dont dive deep enough into all the camera has to offer or they enforce their opinion too strongly what trust the most is my own eyes give me untouched uncompressed pure samples so can look at it myself its hard to find that with the rare exception being gsmarena for some youtube reviews reviewers show crops but still thats heavily affected by the compression most are so vague the worst being all the mainstream reviewers that focus on presentation instead of the actual review that all their video serves is to kill time the result of it is that the average viewer doesnt even know what to pay attention to they think sharpening details they managed to persuade the average person that iphone has godlike skintones lol so to reiterate the samples on gsmarena main review as well as the preview they posted with early samples from dubai show exactly what im talking about huaweis processing iq is horrible not talking about colors but purely detail and texture processing can pinpoint exactly what im talking about if you wish just try to take photo from car which is speedy can vivo surviveno yes why not saw how vivo was blury just put the vivo in low light conditionthen you will see the result used it for year no problem it doesnt get blurry more than any other phone used if the subject is moving or youre not holding the camera steady then of course there will be blur why should it be even green from other side sometimes it detects green light as blue at night dont see that maybe share proof
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,is google youtube facebook and whatsapp accessible on huawei smart phone pura
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,posted samples and gave objective analysis you were just mad that your favorite brand was more without using them now you became bit better watch chinese review sources instead like bilibili and others there are something that cant really tell you here why you should see chinese source instead hope you get it and you should know when we say about huawei its not about game cant tell you more clear than this as huawei is fighting with sanctions how do you let yourself easily to call someone fanboy if he defend from an opinion why should even taking huawei side in part should be called fanboy used xiaomihuawei and samsung and they gave me good view to have better judgment about review you can find xiaomi or any brand customers who confess about huawei camera why even blind when somepeople who arent fanfanboyfangirlfanmanfanwoman may make lot of mistakes as we see these things lot thats not really my favorite brand as like other brands like nothinghonorxiaomirealme and even vivo itself its just about our belives and opinions so fanboy or being fan isnt bad thing at all as they often use and know brand more than us some of them already used other brands too what is bad is wrong judgment you can still easily put tag to someone as blind or anything and call it objective analysis one more thingi dont need to be realistic because its about our belivesweyou and everyone belive its true way and this is how we are realistic no one is realistic as humans make lot of mistakes belive usuallynot completely chinese brands are almost equal when it comes to comparison or what they made for price is that my only opinionno prefer to see other sides too instead of one side belive if huawei or other chinese brands miss somethingthey will fillreplace or solve it by something else or do other solutions so what is showing itself is what people need if you want good camera phone with strong chipset like snapdragon elitethen go for oppovivo and honor but if you think snapdragon heat more and think kirin chipset is somehow better in some parts and being able to play call of duty with best camera bestnot good then go for huawei if durability and resistant is matterthen go for blackviews and dogee which give you weaker chipset and camera but instead you get very large battery thats allthey worked for price and for this brandhuawei you can see great result in durability by insane tests if you watched them its not about camera or chipset we should review carefully other parts like os to see what they missed and gave we say no google or poor customization but other side huawei really worked on smooth and other part of os however gboxthird party apps for solution almost fix it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,if its emotional so how about yours humble at least know you didnt respec more posted samples and gave objective analysis you were just mad that your favorite brand was exposed as overrated well not everyone is fanboy and not everyone is blind im always happy to continue the conversation and present my argument if youre willing to be realistic and accept facts while actually presenting your argument without logical fallacies
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,awesome another emotional comment please provide factual argument next time like did more if its emotional so how about yours humble at least know you didnt respect at all you become emotional and then expect hug or something sweat
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,nm hahahaha
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,you dont need dxomark you put label to everyone who is opposite with you you more awesome another emotional comment please provide factual argument next time like did dont have anything specific against huawei its just the fact that its the most overrated at the moment
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,would be amazing if you could explain instead of seeming like youre defending the indefe more you dont need dxomark you put label to everyone who is opposite with you youre from their marketingyou are from dexomark would you like to hear if someone tell you where are you coming from pittyat least not here saw how vivo was blury just put the vivo in low light conditionthen you will see the result why should it be even green from other side sometimes it detects green light as blue at night whats wrong with vivo just try to take photo from car which is speedy can vivo surviveno think you have kind of basic problem with huawei thats absolute hate which is based from your feelingsnot logic if notthen there are lot of brands that you could start to hate them for many reasons like camera and etc but you didntyour comments are only for huawei its compeletly clear that you made this account to expot your wrong opinion about huawei
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,actually is just patent they cant use stated but instead they goto stick with plus sometime like that which technically run in or better speed
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,dont listen to haters if you cant afford this get pura pro any phone without google is godly by todays standards if you know what mean would buy this just for the sake of getting rid of google
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,mind you we dont mark one feature reverse properly reading the test results carefully would be amazing if you could explain instead of seeming like youre defending the indefensible everything matters not just one thing but what im talking about is most often overlooked so no wonder that the average person doesnt even know the difference between sharpening and details the difference here is obvious for anyone who wants to look sure maybe huawei more often nails skintones better than vivo but in my opinion overall lighting is often more natural on vivo but in any case are you telling me should prioritize color and lighting or please tell me which other characteristic you deem most important which is usually very easy to fix in post processing while the photos look like this one on top httpsibbcogzbfbmk httpsibbconqthvt if youre actually from dxomark then would just like you to ask how you arent embarrassed to post these results
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,can you imagine that someone still holds those corrupt clowns to some standard mean gu more mind you we dont mark one feature reverse properly reading the test results carefully
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,yeah the fact that you mentioned dxomark tells me enough those guys lost their credibili more can you imagine that someone still holds those corrupt clowns to some standard mean guys just go watch the review open the photo samples you dont have to be an expert or photographer just need to have functioning eyes in this series they are judging the texture httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostneondotsdragonydxomarkpjpg httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostneondotsvivoxultradxomarkjpg ok huawei has good texture even though its oversharpened af and has lot of artifacts and aliasing as usual but why is vivo blurry you couldnt pick better sample here im sure this is done on purpose but lets continue in these photos they are judging bokeh httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostriversidebokehhuaweipuraultradxomarkjpg httpswwwdxomarkcomwpcontentuploadsmediaspostriversidebokehvivoxultradxomarkjpg huawei great exposure color details and segmentation blah blah blah where are the great details in this ai mess oh but wait were testing bokeh now details dont matter not even when they uncover the massive flaws of the camera and expose terrible processing just look at the lower portion of the photos such as hair and clothing this isnt worthy of mid range cameras from let alone the top spot in the rankings today is this what we have fallen to open your eyes and stop rewarding mediocrity dxomark is irrelevant today
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,being innovative is coming up with impressive products that perform accordingly and not hyping more yeah the fact that you mentioned dxomark tells me enough those guys lost their credibility long ago so seriously stop believing their bs rankings
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,people are glazing huawei because of the impressive innovation they still manage to pull of wh more being innovative is coming up with impressive products that perform accordingly and not hyping underwhelming products like in the case of huawei pura ultra and the likes besides and talking about being banned whos stopping huawei from excelling to the level wherein harmonyos surpasses google in becoming the silky flexible widely adopted and goto mobile operating system one more thing for those who erroneously claim the opposite oppo find ultra is currently dxomarks camara king not huawei pura ultra which at no time ever was though
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,disappointed very unlike huawei how over processed the photos look worse than the
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,price euro antutu is this joke
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,because of samsung fall and samsung fall why didnt you catch it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,their brain work well when its about their own brand population well what would you more china is becoming popular in smartphones and car manufacturing industry no doubt they have best quality in the future china is taking over globally and peoples inspired from there innovation and quality my next phone will be chinese
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,idk why huawei receives sm hate because of samsung fall and
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,disappointed at the telephoto why go through all that engineering for poor or supposed shots dont get it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,very poor sound quality and speaker
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,bro its and yet you are using chipset way back bc this is lie
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so huawei still stuck on nm since quiet dude dont say too loud you awaking impressiveinnovation fans here
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this price is way to high it got same cpu like pro nm years ago the cpu difference is
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,bro you lie lot your xiaomi ultra is not comparable with pura ultra at all your vi more we all have eyes and the samples are here for us to see people are glazing over huawei because of their former glory similarly to how pixel is still considered by many as the best camera phone just because they were destroying the competition starting with nexus and up until maybe pixel before they went downhill this is results like these are unacceptable for flagship phone know its hard to accept but vivo oppo and xiaomi are so far ahead its not even funny mean its very easy open any photo sample in full resolution click to zoom to cringe at how bad the processing is people smeared to look like ps characters foliage made from water painting even photos which should theoretically give the best processing has weird looking people thanks to distortion and smearing google disasters what exactly is disaster there why is wanting western apps living in western region bad
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,pura ultra review secretly went away
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,just purchased the base pura amazing device but mine has emui
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,bro you speak lot but say nothing except sounding like commercial for huawei the countles more bro you lie lot your xiaomi ultra is not comparable with pura ultra at all your vivo and oppo may definitly lose to huawei camera dont be fool on fake reviews and wait to see what will the result be they even copy huawei mate camera design dont lie about something that you havent tried or not sure about it go and enjoy your xiaomi or vivo with google disastersor maybe samsung
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,still using huawei pura normal with harmony os and doing great job non compare with other brands or models and am keeping receive updates even upgrades
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,offer you to try huawei pura ultra yourself if you dont believe why many people say more bro you speak lot but say nothing except sounding like commercial for huawei the countless samples ive seen from huawei just confirms that their camera is garbage for the standards that have been set in wasnt even referring to the chipset but purely camera output oversharpened photos and denoise which gives terrible plastic results artifacts and aliasing which have never seen from either vivo oppo or xiaomi to be fair such aliasing is specific to just huawei ai failing to produce normal human looking results even at slight zoom overbrightened photos no custom tuning etc etc who cares about night mode why would want night time photos to look like day and increasing sharpening even more normal auto mode photos are whats necessary today colors are true to life give me break if you arent from their marketing team then stop glazing over brands which phone does such great thing as well as huawei why are you using those advertisement terms theres literally nothing special about it why would care about kunlun glass or whatever marketing term they use every type of glass on flagship is durable enough for daytoday situations and every single one will break under unfortunate circumstances where you drop it on rough surface with the old chipset poor camera performance no google support this phone isnt nearly worth such price if anything people should just get the honor for half the price or go with another normal phone that has better camera system you dont need to follow hater words to save your favorite brands being objective and criticizing shortcomings isnt hater words switched ton of brands even had huawei phone in the past if theres one thing hate its fanboys be realistic you cant fool anyone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,you guys trust chinese phones dont trust huawei
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,apple should not be in this story at all its nothing to boast about for beating apple more offer you to try huawei pura ultra yourself if you dont believe why many people say huawei camera are best thats truth huawei is number one you can see it yourself night mode is really good detail and colors are more natural you can take best photos there is no reason to deny it kunlun galss is another great thing that we can find on huawei just see the drop test of mate series its reallly strong how can we call it overpriced which phone does such great thing as well as huawei
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,im not hater of brands im hater of false promises and overrated products lov more thanks god dont lose myself on love or etc for brand simply tell you they all have their own benefits vivo and xiaomi focus on process more while huawei may works on others parts dont know antutu calculate huawei chipset in hypertrading mode or not but know hypertrading is great thing for smartphone chipset you can find this technology on kirin while dont know that snapdragons or mediateks add such ability as it was started by huawei for smartphones quality of processing or power of processingwhich one of course quality is important if we miss quality and just go by power an fast runningthen what would happens to device health have we ever thought about why snapdragon chipsets heat more while it focus on power of process more they both are important first quality second power of process or etc as it can be used in any parts specially software
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,dxomark wait youre serious dxomark reviews are clown fiesta and nobody with function more you dont need dxomark go and try it yourself but dont get angry if huawei was stronger sorry if your vivo or oppo cant be as well as huawei in camera you dont need to follow hater words to save your favorite brands they all are good in some parts smartphone isnt about stronger chipset
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,lol think you got angry before you read comments he replied someone about his years old more apple should not be in this story at all its nothing to boast about for beating apple but phone cameras have grown immensely in the last years thanks to mostly vivo and oppo huawei plastic processing from years ago just doesnt cut it anymore even normies recognized the importance of having more natural photos and you dont have to be professional photographer to clearly differentiate between having phone camera processing and actually good camera processing
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,bro huawei holds the best camera in the world not as of right now because oppo beat the huawe more dxomark wait youre serious dxomark reviews are clown fiesta and nobody with functioning eyes holds them as reference mean huawei and iphone get the and their reviews are inconsistent and full of illogical conclusions they strip exif data in the review device is given praise but the next time its presented as comparison model for another phones review suddenly its not doing so great dxomark is all about luckily we can view the uncompressed photo samples and not listen to brand glazing
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,hating brand shouldnt let us to lie huawei is really best camera phone with best quality im not hater of brands im hater of false promises and overrated products loving brand shouldnt let us lie huawei camera is simply lagging behind the other chinese oem but hey if you like plastic processing and people in zoom photos looking like playstation characters then you must love this camera
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,guys if you want to have flashable devicei cant offer this brand because bootloader more one more thing dont forget to check the exact rom which is made for specific model that you want to buy for example if you have realme cyou must definitely download custom rom that made for realme cyour own model dont download another realme rom that doesnt match to your device model for example dont download realme narzo lite custom rom for realme thats why said to check there is any custom rom for smartphone brand and model that you want to buy before you spendwaste your money oh man dont know realme is good for custom rom or flashable just gave an example
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,well trust no more or less than would trust google android more brainwash isnt that simple to describe here once theyit got your idtheyit will connect you now know why cant we take out that battery easily as dont trust nonchinese brands which are really suspective as had one prefer to get chinese to flash good rom for me
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the soc is so weak the image quality will suffer the photos use heavy ai the photos look more big lie
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,of course vivo beats it its literally the best camera on phone both xu and xu more hating brand shouldnt let us to lie huawei is really best camera phone with best quality
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the vivo ultra beats the huawei pura ultra specifications are on completely different more of course vivo beats it its literally the best camera on phone both xu and xu though their pro model counterparts arent far off oppo is good as well and xiaomi is not too bad either huawei is not even close
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,sorry not as impressive as pura ultra which part is impressive about about more they run with weaker camera and quality emui isnt global android by google its based on android it isnt android itself they add advanced things and ability on their own os which is really better and smoother than android by google you faced to chinese version of android its not less than google android so they develop their own os although it is based on that google itself is big problem for os from other side its pura which made for photography the focus is more on camera if you expect any flagship to work hard on camera like this with mid range chipset then yeah it will be look like this not different huawei do this or xiaomi even if we expect xiaomi to make best camera phone with mid range chipset why not to be look like this then we should blame xiaomi no they get the price for what they have done if no then its disaster they all are chinese better to do more research judjing by only specfication is not also enough
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this phone has esim go look at huawei dubai site supports fps on all cameras its qhd more its not
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,its intresting that still years old huawei device can beat samsung ultra in zoomi don more what do you mean if they get chance kirin is still on nm process also why the comparison with su it has long been surpassed by the likes of vivo oppo and xiaomi also doubt your year old huawei device beats even su the nostalgia effect seems too strong yes huawei had potential in the past but people need to stop glazing huawei is crazy to ask for such high prices for such underpowered phones
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,just ordered one have xu as daily but want to carry this one around for the main camera more im sorry but just couldnt resist what exactly will inch sensor with ryyb array accomplish in low light for this phone if you were comparing raw to raw results maybe it would have an advantage in light intake over rgb but for stock camera jpg performance well just look at these hideous samples in their preview
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,samsung was innovative at that time because of huawei if that goat were allowed to exist with more sorry not as impressive as pura ultra which part is impressive about about this phone exactly the horrible plastic camera processing the subflagship res display the missing ultrasonic fingerprint sensor android year old chipset small lipo battery in this day and age yes the fact that they ask for for such feature set is impressive really this phone is just doa vivo oppo and xiaomi run circles around huawei ban or not large tele camera sensor is cool too bad its completely wasted in this phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,oh you seem to lack some information about cameras not only mp matter also the size of the more yes there is reason why
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the info about prosccor is wrong nm really in
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,does this really have gb ram
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,things that had to be in the phone to make it superior esim qhd display instead of more this phone has esim go look at huawei dubai site supports fps on all cameras its qhd display
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,nm chipset outdated system android google stopped security support no ai features more wrong this is sentinel
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,yes am not dont even like huawei anyway
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,you are not compelled to buy yes am not dont even like huawei anyway
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,eur no esim no buy chinese phones usually dont have esim
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,hey gsmarena you must correct the specs its not optical its optical using of tele sensor crop
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no ultrasonic fingerprint scanner no bluetooth lipo battery but worse of all nm chi more you are not compelled to buy
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,but huawei has sold more phones in china in that apple has worldwide or thats what heard
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,samsung used to have mp optical zoom in their ultra and were the king of long zoom bu more samsung was innovative at that time because of huawei if that goat were allowed to exist without the ban of the population would have been swayed the ban crippled huawei in international market and allowed samsung and iphone to remain on their spot no competition simply means no need for innovation happily we have guys stepping up with innovation not as fast or great like huawei but better than samsung and iphone its xiaomi vivo and oppo their flagship phones is not as impressive as pura ultra but far better than samsung and iphone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the very fact there still making great phones with bands in place is feat when they do mange to get to lower nm then be competitive in cpu gpu as complete package its great phone got last years edition
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,saw this at huawei store in china its really really good camera phone it feels so premium in the hand and the design is so elegant
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,cpu on smartphone best value for money buy comparable to buying brick for the price of house
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,wow brother your usage habits are really strange dont waste the devices feature more there is no here yet and even the is nt stable yet prefer battery life more than anything else my brother
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,specs look good
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,bought pieces of the huawei pultra and have never activate both the and hz featur more wow brother your usage habits are really strange dont waste the devices features if the battery allows
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it does look interesting just going to wait for the global launch and see what it does after more bought pieces of the huawei pultra and have never activate both the and hz features bro even change the fhd on my huawei lite to hd
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,great phone nice dual telephoto setup very clever indeed design might be subjective but always slap case on so it doesnt matter like the hardware especially the cameras wish honor relaunch this phone with google play services and snapdragon chipset then it would be great for people like me in global markets or huawei should create separate brand to resell their phones in global market
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,will be wait ing for hua wei to have an at least optical and digital zoom in video record ings but it seems like the might still not be able to do but strongly believe the will likely be able to do hopefully they might perfect this feature in the pultra pultra
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the huawei ultra is the worst phone ever because it only has harmonyos and not android bu more you should do more research samsung fan there are two versions across huawei phones from pura series phones and above china version is harmonyos and global version is emui can say close to android
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,worse than my xiaomi from while being the release price hahahaha what jokester had years ago and used only year now own pura pro which is better than in every aspect except insignificant charging speed minutes difference xiaomi series got better after series is still solid but not that perfect device
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,dude real or kidding the camera in honor and samsung reached megapixels your camera shoul more you have no clue what you are talking about megapixels dont matter
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,third class product waste of money
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,yes of course have seen with my own eyes the pura ultra it had all type of google serv more it does look interesting just going to wait for the global launch and see what it does after that but hear there wont be on this or something like that
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,and how wished my huawei pultra back design is the huawei ultra back design
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,prefer to not judge fast about such thing think carefully you may already grab sam more have huawei pro for years now amazing phone my wife has galaxy ultra yesterday we compared photos when you zoom in the photo huawei is lot better my dother uses my wifes old huawei pro photo quality is better than on mine and my wifes my wife says that huawei pro was better than galaxy for her
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,dont buy such disaster replacing chinese service to google service is trap they both more prefer to not judge fast about such thing think carefully you may already grab samsung device that never leave you after that if you get new device like huawei samsung still try to chase you and try to misslead you about huawei to pull you toward itself dont make mistake because samsung already worked about mind control you will get unwanted antichinese massages by samsung have used both huawei and samsung
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no good no inch screen no mah baterry samsung does not like this ipoop more inch screen
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,sadly no one cares about ur money bro as the company is too rich to take little money from there so many rich guys wanting to buy this so why should they care and think about you so now have burned your money yet and every one want to know the truth be honest man state the exact amount
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,are you really comparing vivo with huawei how is this question
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,vincent zhong has video on yt on this phone the capabilities are immense this looks absolu more are you really comparing vivo with huawei
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no recording lol
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,cptpower jun meh dont have vivo am happy with my motorola edge pro but if this huawei will be availabl more hi friend and would like to ask for ur opinion on the hua wei pro is it still worth it buying huawei ppro claimed as collection item new sold at around euros and iam looking forward to your fast reply dude
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,your vivo my vivo dont have one have an iphone pro max hasselblad more meh dont have vivo am happy with my motorola edge pro but if this huawei will be available to buy in my country will be happy to buy one as main phone selling my already years old motorola to good people whom can serve next several years
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,its only works in china yes software socks only works only in china
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,since when its only works in china
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,hisilicon kirin is very weak soc on paper compared to snapdragon elite old tech the kirin is weak but what about weaker chip sets like the kirin and kirin and kirin on the huawei matepro and ppro and ultra too man have got no idea that chipset in could already record at fps superslomo and in could zoom up to optical and digital and could also capture object speeding at speed of up kmhour my huawei lite almost never lagged just as long as its memory isnt full and that is equipped with kirin chipset manufactured in and not even talking about my huawei ppro and huawei pultra yet bro
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,androidbased huawei phones offer superior performance compared to those utilizing harmonyos
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the huawei mate series will be an interesting one as it ll have the first gb ram on huawei phone and if it does have all ips ratings like ip ip ipand also fps superslomo and at least the same optical zoom then think would choose the latter hope fully it will have the same back design like the mate man
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei phone good but no goole service makes them bad
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,imagine it was powered by kirin chips with technology from kirin and before believe that one day huawei will return to its former power they are investing lot in rd and am sure that they will catch up with the kirin and earlier processor power in few years
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so guess must be reply ing to the wrong guy bought pieces of the huawei ultra both more was just replying to the suggestion you made that he should save money and buy it in five years for less money in my opinion waiting for so long to get this phone isnt effective since there will be better huawei phone in five years moreover the goal of buying it will lose its charm because he would have waited for so long imagine living your entire life like this waiting to acquire things you wanted now it wouldnt be happy life in my opinion it makes more sense to improve your finances instead of running behind schedule for the rest of your life
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,just imagine this thing powered by snapdragon chip with google services it would be an abs more imagine it was powered by kirin chips with technology from kirin and before
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,wtf double periscope lens
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,cptpower jun compared to this your vivo looks like first nokia back in with mpix cam unique more your vivo my vivo dont have one have an iphone pro max hasselblad phocus mobile doesnt support android
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,that mm telephoto is same size as main sensor on ultra hope series to bring sth similar
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,malaysia have sell huawei too but no much peoples buy it because no google service so dont more huawei world best mobile and hardware all google service do at my pura
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,small aperture tele optics cropping into the sensor or not huawei is experimenting with multiple apertures and sensor designs which is nice the same as with quality by cropping in the past while being mysterious camera tech improves by every generation though like they bring camera improvements its not much to my liking as like more straightforward quality improvements for raw photography it certainly will please those shooting mainly in auto mode tho mp at makes way more sense to me as you get extra detail even compared to mp and better quality at xx mp at superwide would help lot too since basically all brands got trouble resolving hi res at superwide not like ultra performance is all that matters if it did many would already understand and apply this and many other suggestions make at least partly like imagine mp tele with normal bayer we would be shooting the moon without any ai already in high resolution
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,horrible comment this has nothing similar to the iphone just stay quiet if you have nothing more still ugly compared to last gen
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,just save ur money and wait for another years and if lucky enough might be able to fi more in years this will be already outdated if you dont have the money to buy such things then either forget about them or do something to improve your financial situation instead of waiting to save enough of your little salary to enjoy life when you are years old
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,why sidemounted fp sensor when pura had underscreen
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,only used xiaomi but want this phone can you give me only have budget for phone just save ur money and wait for another years and if lucky enough might be able to find one for to euros it will also teach patience in mean time
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,global release when august
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no all the pura members have side mounted fingerprint scanners its probably because more they want to add camera control for puro line up but they dont want similar to their compitator like apple camera control so they put camera control and move fingerprint udfs to smfs together as one
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the side mounted fingerprint scanner is there to act as camera button as well to change zoo more hope the huawei ultra and ultra would still use side mounted fingerprint sensor and exchange that with an additional mah of battery or perhaps screen button like the one in the matepro and do look forward to huawei to refrain using eco leather or ceramic back as it might worn off due to the frequent contact with water also the latter might surge battery replacement price and and so hope that huawei will still stick to glass or metal backs for cheaper future battery replacement cost and also durability reasons so do think the huawei ultra is worth it if al ready have both the huawei ppro and the huawei pultra
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it is said that the kirin chipset is only year behind the best chip set sold out there and if this turned out to be true then think the pultra will be able even further break the persicope zoom boundaries and might even be in thex optical zoom as the chipset now still handicapped so huawei has prepared much more advanced periscope technology which is held back by the chipset technology restrictions and also perhaps it is waiting for other players to keep up with the pace so might skip this pultra wait for pultra instead whats for sure is that there will be an sic battery too
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,are you actually using your device or just looking at the antutu scores that it gets finally someone that uses their brain appreciate it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,im buying huawei bro you may go bust nut on your antutu and geekbench scores the camera is just an absolute top notch by far the cope of samsung apple and google fans is strong
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,this needs to be reviewed
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,sidemounted fingerprint reader wonder what could be the reason possibly another factor to sanctions even the mate had side mounted fingerprint if that was an foldable or flip understood that they couldnt cram it but in normal slab form they are usually found in budget phones
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so does that mean it will run android apps yes of course have seen with my own eyes the pura ultra it had all type of google services the same thing will be with this one as well this phone seems to be real monster cant wait to see some reviews soon
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,in global versions it runs on emui so android based so does that mean it will run android apps
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,wish could buy in nepal wish can buy in slovakia
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,probably the phone of the year if it had nnm chip and android its still phone of the year who needs android if it have huawei harmony os no spying from google even better and the nm nm or nm even more its just cosmetic
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the engineering behind this is astonishing huawei is back with banger while other upgraded weapons from doom the dark ages huawei took bfc and unlike in doom dark ages they managed to upgrade it to become true monster killer device well done huawei go go go beat everything you can beat make me proud
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the best is yet to come its the start bro every year huawei will skip by several light years other competition in camera and photography quality like they did since decade ago
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,vivo ultra has mm extender but this phone has real mm optical zoom will see more compared to this your vivo looks like first nokia back in with mpix cam unique at its best but like nokia this vivo failed too because they came up with an illusion or optical magic trick while huwai took the miracle possibilities
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,finaly flagship as equal as xiaomi ultra all other flagship were just flagship killers ats its best this is once again true photography king
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,not anymore microg and apks dont work on hmos works with emui tho
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,since its mp would guess its an crop and therefore which pretty much goes in more the telephoto lenses both utilise the same sensor
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,horrible camera design just copy iphone horrible comment this has nothing similar to the iphone just stay quiet if you have nothing useful to say
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei pura always the best
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,if americans politicians continue playing all the childish brain tumor tech war china will eventually leap surpass in the area within few years or decade the most that mean companies like qualcomm intel amd nvidia microsoft etc will lost trillions of profits and more after that
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the mp quad bayer sensor is the largest telephoto to be installed in any phone more since its mp would guess its an crop and therefore which pretty much goes in line with google and samsung on their times periscope so im fairly confident it will be the best telephoto we have yet
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,poor processor nm the pro could zoom up to think and the ppro could zoom of up to for picture taking and for video recordings and the ppro optical zoom and digital zoom zoom for video recordings just think about what
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,overpriced phone without google service sd card audio jack it has optical zoom and optical zoom and two peri scope cameras and think can forget about the absence of jack and try the peri scope and will be able forget about the rest the moment uve tried it
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,heard theyll use hz for their vanilla flavored half eaten fruits isnt it tru more if its true consumers who never experienced the smoothness of hz might thanks to apple xd
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,you mean company who putted extra button that cus doesnt ask for as an innovation heard theyll use hz for their vanilla flavored half eaten fruits isnt it truly innovative
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no it is not true all the google services work only google wallet and android auto doesn more but now you can get android auto form gbox
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,would be happy to buy this phone how or where do buy it in kenya huawei proud customer
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,aside from that unreliable gbox you can also use microg aurora store its not that co more not anymore microg and apks dont work on hmos
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,nice camera specs well done
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,only through gbox which is basically like virtual machine offering you access to gms aside from that unreliable gbox you can also use microg aurora store its not that complicated to install once it installed gms will run just like the other android phones
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,now this is called true innovation dual periscope telephoto lens and zoom length with the same sensor thats wild huawei is killing the competition for sure
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,side mounted fingerprint in big
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei said that telephoto camera is in when they released phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,is my eyes ok or im seeing ultra phone have ghz chipsetwhattttt
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei is futuristic tech in every field huawei devices lack of processors and google services
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,holy shi thats the same stone age processor
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,so now that hua wei is using side mounted finger print it should use the lcd display on the lite again and of course the latest one ex change the lcd to an sic batt my huawei lite had an accidental burn in caused by an alcohol spray and it completely dissappeared around weeks on it own so ips lcd is still the best until now
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,is sony anywhere near huawei in camera perfomance its nowhere near huawei new pura sony using old pathetic tiny sensor that really horrible and as you zoom in its become worse while new huawei pura using sensor which the largest tele sensor currently
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the pura ultra model has cores not the error comes from the emiko matcui reporter from hc on the right image at the page bottom you can see the report on the cpu with configuration and cores taishan large core ghz taishan medium cores ghz taishan small cores ghz httpswwwhuaweicentralcomhuaweipuraproultramodelsusekiringprocessor
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,wrong its different implementation sony did not use duallens setup its features variable more is sony anywhere near huawei in camera perfomance
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,liked everything about this phone felt like the selfie camera was lacking something it doesnt have the video recording that it should have and the bluetooth is only and the under display fingerprint
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,source my pura ultra have the phone right now is there way to add google services
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,look at the telephoto camera of sonys mk xperia this is basically the same im more wrong its different implementation sony did not use duallens setup its features variable telephoto lens that can switch between two different focal lengths so its dual focal lengths not dual lens setup while the idea maybe come from that but huawei using different implementation so yeah huawei is correctly calling its first in industry using dual lens setup idk why you keep insisting on every pura post that huawei copying sony while in reality using different implementation
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,mp at magnification instead of mp is it cropping in from by to achieve an optical quality like result
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,mm phone and mm camera humb why and only mah batery why
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the right price youre crazy the pixel pro doesnt even come close to this and google dared to ask for more than this phone has the most advanced hardware on the market right now not to mention the amazing value of the clear pixels
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the fingerprint is side mounted because if the screen breaks sometimes the fingerprints usually stops working on the screen but with side mounted fingerprint this problem is fixed
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,am loving all these telephoto evolutions hope it truly is just mm optical zoom with that sensor gizmochina said its that size even if mpx only
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,isnt the telephoto camera shifting the periscopes part from the lens to the le more it probably crops to mp when using without an option to use mp so they listed it as two separate sensors
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,the most technically impressive phone of the year well done huawei
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,woah this design looks so premium huawei should keep it up
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,zoom tests are already coming out think the vivo ultra will come in second place
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,ugliest huawei phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,phone worth buying with all the peris cope cameras and ip rating and very high screen to body ratio this is just to good to be true at just crazy euros
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,what this has to be joke no all the pura members have side mounted fingerprint scanners its probably because they want you to rely on the face id for unlocking although thats just my theory
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,no its true what this has to be joke
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,need source for this info source my pura ultra have the phone right now
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,side fingerprint reader this must be mistake no its true
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,side mounted fp sensor on flagship
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,it cant be real why side mounted fp sensor
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,up the price euro thats more better
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,disappointed by digital
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,deleted post need source for this info
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,while apples eyestraining liquid theme is talked about on social media seeing huaweis launch and devices is promising for technology
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,what chipset will this phone use kirin or snapdragon kirin most definitely huawei isnt allowed to use snapdragon
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,not only is the design ugly but the price for this device with prob bad performance is crazy work
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,huawei does it again they prove that they are still at the top when it comes to camera innovation
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,mm pericsope zoom and sensorshift ois nice
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,please do the review asap if this launches in netherlands with esim this is my next phone
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,crazy cam best camera on any phone have ever seen uptodate
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,hey isnt the telephoto sensor shifting the lens from to lens with motoric mechanism why is it written as having two telephoto sensors
Huawei,Pura 80 Ultra,crazy cam
Huawei,Pura X,if it closed like fold will be small fold device
Huawei,Pura X,really hope they release something with this formfactor to europe huawei honor or someone else
Huawei,Pura X,can not send mms from outside of chine why
Huawei,Pura X,no open mode calls answers why thi is so shame
Huawei,Pura X,cant understand why the other companies dont make phones like thatso much bette more was thinking if width height when folded almost square but smaller than bb passport so when opened it would be around height with width ie height of say mix flip or close to the motorola razr ultra but with the width of the pura would be perfectunderstand that this would drive it to tablet territory with around inches diagonal when opened up however when folded you get all the real estate you want for serious tasks and for more detailed work you open it think the hinge would be stressed lot with the height increaseso either you get taller narrower one like the other flip phones or wider shorter like this one this was great device just pity to do all the workarounds for apps and some things still could not doinstallso had to sell it was not for me
Huawei,Pura X,perfect form factornext version will be thinner with smaller bezel and bigger battery come on samsung do the same instead of your usual bricks
Huawei,Pura X,why is its battery so small its big device and could have bigger battery space constraints most likely the battery has only one in the bottom
Huawei,Pura X,good for huaweicp fanboys the performance isnt even on per with other similarly pr more performance is better then any flagship plus their software continuously makes the phone better instead of spoiling it
Huawei,Pura X,huawei has definitely raised the bar in terms of smart phone functionalities
Huawei,Pura X,just wished this has google play it is the most perfect aspect ratio if you care about text reading and videos without huge blackbands hopefully moto will copy and use this aspect ratio as samsung is just useless they resist change until too late just look at the their foldables
Huawei,Pura X,must take off my hat for huawei despite numerous effort to keep them down by the us they more good for huaweicp fanboys the performance isnt even on per with other similarly priced devices
Huawei,Pura X,huawei innovating as always this phone is very strange but at least huawei doesnt copy more ah yes because an mp telephoto is innovation
Huawei,Pura X,as always huawei innovate the new smartphone dimensions samsung and apple here is the model to copy and paste
Huawei,Pura X,wandered into chinese shopping center today and the first shop was huawei showroom and had pura love at first sight moment spent the next minutes playing with it minutes of which were devoted to getting it to display english ive been waiting for phone with an actually useful footprint ever since the last xiaomi max is that or years ago and im guessing im not alone the notion of onehanded operation on phone that weighs gm or more always seemed slightly ridiculous to me and ive always preferred thumb typing anyway which requires at least mm which this offers in spades would have bought it on the spot but then what about banking apps that require gms not to mention gmail if its totally new do other apps like outlook lite work natively and are platforms like gbox secure none of those things will probably stop me from buying it but ill wait month and see if honor or other manufacturers look like they may jump on board thumbs up to huawei for finally creating for me common sense design wouldnt mind it in bar format either but even folded it has workable screen size
Huawei,Pura X,why should they stop huawei is the most innovative company in the world even with the american pressure
Huawei,Pura X,wow love the big screen hope samsung will make flip with this form factor
Huawei,Pura X,they dont want to stop
Huawei,Pura X,thats what happens if you spend lil care to an anon comment yeah but it happens even when replying named comments todays people have so complain about ipad kids but think every generation is the same personal experience was chatting with person in this platform it was more like writing letters email very big comment and reply it was not regular but just few replies suddenly some people read few lines and you know what happened someone even said we were using ai and it was not joke dont remember the reply but it was aggressive to some extent as if its impossible for humans to express their feelings and thoughts in detail its sad that the vast majority are in the past illiterate but now dont care about reading its not like people are lazy because they are working for the rich but even after getting education their literacy is replaceable even the most capable artists is replaceable now
Huawei,Pura X,im lefthanded phone user and this phone with leftinward flipping design is perfect more have no problem handling other phones by left hand unless the size is too huge then it wont matter by which hand use it with
Huawei,Pura X,funniest ever
Huawei,Pura X,your coment was wasted because the person who needed this info was not notified just read th more thats what happens if you spend lil care to an anon comment
Huawei,Pura X,dont you think this is not huaweis problem huawei certainly wants to expand its global mark more all countries and plititics has its own problem the core idea of letting them have too much power has long been problem which we can observe from history time after time but the clwns want us to think that its normal for them to have power over us while original idea is not like that
Huawei,Pura X,videocalling people use their smartphones to have video chat with relatives and friends livi more your coment was wasted because the person who needed this info was not notified just read the comment replied replied to also id appreciate it if you read my real comment
Huawei,Pura X,just curious how wide is this phone
Huawei,Pura X,if they put the front camera in corner that would be great example matepad pro the cen more why do you need crappy front cam on phone that has another screen next to the main cam why do manufactures still do this doubt the ppl who needwant selfie cam are the same ppl that buy your dollar phones
Huawei,Pura X,these screen dimensions are optimal for my preference still miss my xiaomi mi mix and max sadly this one is too heavy make it sub
Huawei,Pura X,like the design its like phone and mini tablet and its just so gorgeous huawei mate xt fold phone size tablet huawei pura action camera size but unfold to mini tablet with display area larger than ultra pro max huawei mate xs in phone better than its already different era now sweet spot combo
Huawei,Pura X,doesnt that make it kinda worthless outside of china know huawei doesnt care more dont you think this is not huaweis problem huawei certainly wants to expand its global market but countries like the united states have been suppressing chinas technology because of chinas progress huawei dji etc
Huawei,Pura X,new era of chinese back on stage
Huawei,Pura X,huawei has no out of china have pura and although it has but its always on only doesnt that make it kinda worthless outside of china know huawei doesnt care lot about the global market but is it that difficult to integrate support for other bands too genuine question btw
Huawei,Pura X,this device has no crease when unfolded will be excellent for gaming like foldables alot and huawei shows the world they are top tier in this segment
Huawei,Pura X,they should have made the device taller to at least cm when unfolded would have bought the device in blink
Huawei,Pura X,this device is dope with all these specifications
Huawei,Pura X,this device is very innovative and think will even match devices with processors built on nm due to the deep hardware and software integration
Huawei,Pura X,very expensive phone without outdated chipsetno buy sorry this device has lte go check it out and the cpu is undisclosed the kirin stated there is simply guess
Huawei,Pura X,how does this fold just dont understand stick to folds flips and maybe trifolds more understand how it folds now but it is still kinda unnecessary
Huawei,Pura X,please fold it in the other direction and add keyboard and old school display no they wont demand for such thing is just too little
Huawei,Pura X,super
Huawei,Pura X,wow nice phone huawei is trying despite the sanctions
Huawei,Pura X,pen please
Huawei,Pura X,amazing phone design is perfect ya every day is good day until the day you spotted the processor speed
Huawei,Pura X,huawei living in now
Huawei,Pura X,im sure neither xiaomi oppo vivo honor will release similar phone soon it come with more uh because they managed to pull something off even if the odds were against them the competition doesnt experience us sanctions and why are you mad that alternatives exist
Huawei,Pura X,nice phone and amazing design the price hmmmmmm global version or only china version huawei job well done
Huawei,Pura X,the width sits close to sony xperia ultra and asus zenfone ultra mm less and about mm more than the blackberry passport finally something different and you can use to read not just watch tiktok or youtube
Huawei,Pura X,best phone huawei king
Huawei,Pura X,idk why my brain thinks this phone was for babies not for everyone that is not babies from ipad babies to foldable babies
Huawei,Pura X,as per gsmarena this is the worlds first phone without any processor wtf its not that there is no chipset but because huawei is banned by the united states so after being released globally it will be found out what processor it uses know you want to be funny but you have to use your brain little bit
Huawei,Pura X,cptpower mar if available in slovakia woiuld love to buy one google services or not dont care we have hu more you can get it anyway ebay or average dad tech store the price should be around the original this isnt an add but recommendation avarage dad tech store is youtuber what likes to talk about chinese phones also at his store there is mention that he will pay the taxes duties if its above hope helped with you wonderful sunny day
Huawei,Pura X,first tri fold then the bigger clamshell idea bro huawei is literally wants to be first in the more its rumored to launch in april or may
Huawei,Pura X,you bet company out there is gonna copy paste this
Huawei,Pura X,huawei pura
Huawei,Pura X,and at the same time samsungs idea of innovation is launching the same phone every year with different colors
Huawei,Pura X,is right recall sony had laptop with the giant inch series back from real usable area this one is correctnot some banana phone tv remote stuff that is just nice to look at and play with one hand and watch videos
Huawei,Pura X,recall the wide ones that came in firstthen they gradually started whittling away at the width year after yearand now instantly you have the folks coming in saying how they cannot hold this and work with one hand etcthis is not meant to be one of thoseyou have plenty of choices in those banana phones smh
Huawei,Pura X,it should be not the world is replacing with or only make more again the narrow folks with banana phone tv remote aspirationssheeshlet the wide ones come on about time we got the wide phones back
Huawei,Pura X,no processor wow
Huawei,Pura X,trade import and inflation why they are expensive in the western world not their fault it more not true in china their pricing is on par with apple it is generally considered an expensive brand just that they have cheaper offerings as well compared to apple biggest issue have with huawei is always the chipset else their stuff seems really good
Huawei,Pura X,omg wth thats actually genius idea foldable that flips flippable the ratio is very missed thats more sane ratio for tablet at least from my own experience with tablets
Huawei,Pura X,the should make inch version of this it would be perfect
Huawei,Pura X,it reminds me phad pro by lenovo from but its amazing device httpswwwgsmarenacomlenovophabprophp
Huawei,Pura X,well this has some potential its clearly not going to replace traditional flipstyle fo more if available in slovakia woiuld love to buy one google services or not dont care we have huawei harmony inside and for the rest anyone can use gblox app
Huawei,Pura X,this is pocketer more than the pocket series itself
Huawei,Pura X,what even is this thing you can trace similiar form factor phone in the past sony call it xperia ultra not fold phone tho
Huawei,Pura X,razr and xiaomiflip make videok but thiseu dont who makes videos phones werent made to be used as hollywood cameras
Huawei,Pura X,all the genius is ruined by the fact that huawei has no support for google apps
Huawei,Pura X,any info on the chipset used for this one not really am willing to bet it uses the kirin
Huawei,Pura X,green yellow gb ram as ramspace
Huawei,Pura X,this sounds good pity its from huawei their devices are always too expensive imo trade import and inflation why they are expensive in the western world not their fault its what happens bet they are in lineslightly cheaper in the easthome country vs main brands also remember huawei like to try and innovate unlike samsung anymore apple never did they just know how to hype things up so usually new concepts will cost more
Huawei,Pura X,huawei is really in another league with new innovations and designs hope one day we can see it again with gms
Huawei,Pura X,is this pad that can flip
Huawei,Pura X,would buy slate phone with this ratio and flagship specs in heartbeat so sick of the ex more blackberry like
Huawei,Pura X,that time lg optimus vu got reincarnated as foldable phone from huawei lol
Huawei,Pura X,interestingly this phone is narrower then the sony xperia ultra from which had more just checked it you are right this is physically narrower than that sony phone despite the theoretically wider aspect ratio on paper also checked that the huawei pmax is also physically wider than this
Huawei,Pura X,with that price think at most kirin for foldable
Huawei,Pura X,while im still not fan of foldable phones in general its hard to ignore the main screens tablet aspect ratio huawei seems to be onto something interesting here
Huawei,Pura X,its soo cute it makes the ipad mini cry
Huawei,Pura X,looks cursed
Huawei,Pura X,huawei keep up with the innovations samesung is sleeping
Huawei,Pura X,at first thought this is an pad like shaped if it really is then it going to be interesting
Huawei,Pura X,now this is an interesting one so its insanely wide yet small kinda cool
Huawei,Pura X,finally modernized odm alternative to the beloved lg vu series
Huawei,Pura X,gorgeous
Huawei,Pura X,literally saw this on tiktok an hour ago thought it was prototype from with that camera design it came out just now love the idea of making it notepad instead of those square foldables really loved how the rear screen works
Huawei,Y5p,ve been using this phone since june and honestly dont have much to complain about except for it not having google services wouldnt call it amazing but for the price it gets the job done we also have redmi in the same price range and that one lags so badly yp isnt completely lag free but its way better than also like that its not too big ive dropped it so many times that all the buttons are gone and the screen is seriously cracked its still working but think its time to get new phone
Huawei,Y5p,this was my ever real first phone ive ever had the memories of this phone would never forget unfortunately the left side of the phone was malfunctioning and ghost touch which is quite kinda disappointing and then last year accidentally dropped it and the screen in the upper was broken black quite couple days later the screen started glitching which upsets me so badly nevertheless this was my best phone ever didnt expect that it would last more than years honestly loved this phone so much my main phone rn is vivo which im planning to buy samsung or an old flagship phone since it is better than most of the midranges these days
Huawei,Y5p,got huawei yp but the problem so fast to drain the battery even phone not use so this more bought mine from friend and noticed that as well thought it was only me
Huawei,Y5p,about the os version android emui no google play services does this os support online money apps the aurora store can it support apps like tiktok there is many problems with money apps not working for me in the uk but dont know how it works in other markets just need too know what is supported in software development and support work for money know of money apps from paidfromsurverys
Huawei,Y5p,ive tried getting to aurora store and it wont work help use aurora store and its the best you can login to your google account
Huawei,Y5p,google shouldnt own most of the market share hopefully huawei makes comeback the appgallery is good app store hms core is great app store
Huawei,Y5p,dave jan huawei yp are they yes is network
Huawei,Y5p,huawei yp are they
Huawei,Y5p,ive been using this phone since august and might say that was disappointed at first because im kid and didnt know that huawei doesnt have google services it was good at first but the more use it the more it lags well ig this is cheap and has gb ram but for the price might say that it was pretty decent
Huawei,Y5p,just use aurora store to download all apps from google play for the non compatible apps use spark for gmail and snaptube for youtube im very satisfied with phone after months very compact not heavyphone and all functions perfect all social media apps installed
Huawei,Y5p,surely everyone knows huawei cant use google services for at least years so why you bought more not everyone is updated about internet stuff
Huawei,Y5p,very light and responsive but as long as google is not installable in it it is useless mos more microg
Huawei,Y5p,no earpiece which is bad
Huawei,Y5p,reallyreally regret buying this phone and want to kick myself for my sheer stupidity fine more are you serious having this device cant be terrible than owning nokia the lack of google apps is deal breaker but besides that dont see anything wrong with the device itself since im accustomed to use feature phones on regular basis and feature phones dont come with google apps preloaded on them besides having few smartphones also have the nokia which is feature phone which had the essential that need like micro sd card slot built in mm audio jack and decent music player
Huawei,Y5p,stunning phone love it no problems at all for me and have all the apps need without google play good job huawei
Huawei,Y5p,also bought this phone without knowing it does not have google play am very upset
Huawei,Y5p,mistake buying this it has manny flaws will refund imedetly
Huawei,Y5p,choose it for its sizenot too big specs not that bad either although for its price you can have higher specs and yes google playstore
Huawei,Y5p,is it that bad better take redmi bcause it come with mp camera bigger screen big battery and google
Huawei,Y5p,cannot used this phone no google no huawei app galleryalso no keyboard to message hi you can look for an app named aurora store its like google playstore you can find it in google
Huawei,Y5p,for budget phone it is quite good the best thing for me there are no google services whatever application you want incl google mobile services you can install through other stores such as aptoid avrora store fdroid and others battery holds charge for up to days under light use and every thing else works just fine
Huawei,Y5p,no google play no whatsapp no facebook app dont buy this wasted my money go get it on apks or maybe on app gallery
Huawei,Y5p,all what you are saying is missing is available just do some perusing exactly
Huawei,Y5p,me too don have this problem at my phone only once had this problem but that was minor problem
Huawei,Y5p,the fone is freezing all the time need to keep on locking it and unlocking it all the time more me too
Huawei,Y5p,touchscreen not working and having difficulty set up
Huawei,Y5p,for my th birthday im getting an huawei yp is it good or not yes really budget device with overall midrange specs but bad prosscer camera looks quite good google services is big problem
Huawei,Y5p,its crazy how people react to this phone not having any google services guys you have many other apk stores with all the apps you would want to have its like min work the phone is good camera is not the best battery and performaces are good for its price its good deal bye
Huawei,Y5p,tried flashing and other hacking and messed updo you have solution there is no other solutionyou have to unlock the bootloader wich is imposibletry to buy another new mainboar from another same yp phone
Huawei,Y5p,good but no play store its not problem as you can download apps from huawei appgallery and petal search
Huawei,Y5p,bought this thing for my brother he says that battery life is ok and ram is very good cpu pretty good he thought that would suck but sinds the screen its small you cant see pixels like on my phone which has to big inch screen
Huawei,Y5p,its wow but main prob is wit play store and usa doest want tis company to run
Huawei,Y5p,im just interested by that phone to practice how to install gms before can try to do it on the pro
Huawei,Y5p,its pretty decent phone almost every app use is working wothout any problem only some propietry google apps wont work google maps requires min workaround just bought this phone for messaging and to remain in contact with peoples antutu benchmark results in points all in all really like the phone
Huawei,Y5p,ys emui
Huawei,Y5p,how install play store im using lite and have appgallery wich is same thing as playstore and can download apps from there also can use phoneclone to transfer apps and data to the new phone so dont have to install them again
Huawei,Y5p,hi hate this phone cause you cant download latest app in this phone please respond
Huawei,Y5p,key apps use daily to connect including messenger and spotify using app gallery these more how about using phoneclone to transfer data and apps have lite and everything trasnfered without problem mean it shouldnt be problem
Huawei,Y5p,what about this phones gaming speed
Huawei,Y5p,is apk pure works on huawei yp yes apkpure is working on yp you can also download moreapps for easier search
Huawei,Y5p,cant download playstore playstore is the way to install the app that want that neve more search for aplications in huawei appgallery or moreapps
Huawei,Y5p,its piece of trash yesterday purchased it and today sold it on loss but im ok to have more you can use phone clone to get google stuff on this device if your old phone is other android you can install it on play store and clone google stuff on to the device
Huawei,Y5p,the alternative to google play store is the huawei app gallery yes it is there is also moreapps for the test of the aplications that you cant find on huawei appgallery
Huawei,Y5p,excellent phone for its price range the best part about it is the long lasting battery and gb storage wich is more than enough
Huawei,Y5p,imagine using google spybot called play services besides it comes with it outsie the usa so it does not matter for normies and for you other peeps out there just get aurora store if you want to still use the play store download all the apps without google snooping around
Huawei,Y5p,usually like google services but as situation off google rules and regulations huawei you must develope huawei app store better take hand from other apk site and re develope that apps for huawei without run google service dewelop map like google map make app all apps like google peoples will welcome you good luck huawei
Huawei,Y5p,apkpure the alternative to google play store is the huawei app gallery
Huawei,Y5p,super phone and no google play excelent agree with you battery lasts so much longer
Huawei,Y5p,what is alternative of google play store alternative is huawei appgallery along with moreapps
Huawei,Y5p,yp requid to improve battry capacity to atleast mah ram is in gb instead of gb more its low priced phone go whine somewhere else dont expect flagship specs when buying low priced smart phones jeez you people should stop that mentality
Huawei,Y5p,amazon has an app store and there is fdroid

Huawei,Y5p,come are this people kiddin how would they place its price at with just of ram and more right no google and almost half the world try not to buy ccp products just put or gb and fast charge heck would buy it
Huawei,Y5p,guys guys this is euro phone youre lucky to have full size phone for thats price was just about to say the same thing when saw other posts mean for euros what do you want more the specs are good for that price and device is good for the low end segment
Huawei,Y5p,the phone needs mah battery to justify this price maybe also gb extra ram come are this people kiddin how would they place its price at with just of ram and mah of battery capacity why not of ram and battery of mah that should satisfy its price gosh price too high if not that the phone gives what is needed would prefare tecno spark
Huawei,Y5p,wayyyyy too overpriced like more than it shouldve been
Huawei,Y5p,as if there are cameras in the picture im also confused maybe the second one is only depth sensor
Huawei,Y5p,nokia what is but this an phone mostly same specs
Huawei,Y5p,gb ram mp front camera and no fingerprint scanner for dollars what joke this phone should be priced at around dollars
Huawei,Y6p,this phone was in pandemic days and should say its better to have redmi note than this phone to me its the design built why its nice

Huawei,Y6p,need assistance my phone has serious network issue took it to different phone engineers more try go to system and updates reset reset all settings
Huawei,Y6p,been using as borrowed phone in the meantime never really saw myself liking it battery last almost all day with light to medium use camera is decent works ok in good lighting surprised how well the chipset works in modern gamescod pubg no issues with storage either stream most content fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable as well as facial recognition lack of google support got me however using workarounds like apkpure and gbox has been ok but not great for basic user and the security of your accounts are bit of fear overall decent phone for temporary use or for someone who just needs device to communicate quickly and using basic social media

Huawei,Y6p,very nice android deviceperformances are amazing with thispricedisplay quality also nice more have already replied in this forum about google meet mean its not perfectly working but its fine just goto huawei app gallery search for google meet you will google meet icon saying open open it and guess you can sign in not sure about it because only used by code and there is floating circle thing with dots and symbol click dots and add to desktop it will create shortcut for you on home screen test it out and let me know weather it works mine works but usually dont use meet like maybe time used and it worked
Huawei,Y6p,cant download or update new version of apps it says its not compatible of the gpu can you say which app and from where you download
Huawei,Y6p,pls does it mean no play store if yes do we need to download petal store or it comes with more no play store because of uschina trade war app gallery and petal search comes with huawei devices would suggest using apkpure which is very good for updating and getting apps and for youtube already posted how to download you can check it out and other all social media apps works flawlessly
Huawei,Y6p,please give me some advice thank you
Huawei,Y6p,also another easy way to use google meet and google classroom is goto huawei app gallery search google meet there will be google meet saying open press open and now you can use it easily from that side corner somewhere there is circle with dots press that and press add to desktop now you can directly open it from homescreen and the same method for google classroom note please update quick app center in app gallery in order to work best hope this helps if any questions reply here
Huawei,Y6p,for many people who are struggling for apps most of the apps you can get through petal search and the other way is download apkpure it will give access to almost all google play store apps noted that some apps really need play store to work but most apps works link for apkpure download httpsmapkpurecomapkpurecomapkpureaegondownload and for youtube you can download youtube vanced check out httpsmapkpurecomapkpurecomapkpureaegondownload and for google meet unfortunately you cant get either you should download google play store you can check out latest videos in youtube for download check latest one because the old way to download play store mostly dont work or use web version its little hard because you have to change view to desktop view to work
Huawei,Y6p,agree currently not every app is available but you can still acess youtube through browser more you can now download youtube vanced easily with this app you can sign into your account and enjoy youtube easily check out httpsconsumerhuaweicomaeencommunitydetailsbappsguidedhowtoinstallyoutubevancedtopicid

Huawei,Y6p,dear all im eying to buy this one just wanted to know if can use whatsapp gmail goo more recently bought the yp which similar to the yp but theres obviously the price difference although both are not supported by google which concern many have whatsapp running on my phone and although they do not have gmail it does allow you to connect to your gmail account on the hauwei email app sadly youtube can not be download as an app but you can watch it via the browser meaning just go the browser and search youtube and everything is fine they do not have google maps as they are not supported by google but im sure there are alternatives on the hauwei app gallery hoped this help
Huawei,Y6p,how can everyone say that this game is not for gaming on my own opinion gb ram and mah more it has mah and big capacity but look at chipset and processor its big mistake to buy this phone to play
Huawei,Y6p,gb ram version where available
Huawei,Y6p,go see techmagnet he installed google play services on and it works but not in yp
Huawei,Y6p,dude its for low baget the specs are good for poor like medont say stupid thing just because more lol he was saying that you can get better specs at same price explain how being rich is relevant read
Huawei,Y6p,regret myself for buying this fon why did you regret to buy
Huawei,Y6p,dont buy ds phone its not worth ur money some apps just crushed and dont run and worst not available to install
Huawei,Y6p,but we cant use google apps whats the work around for that
Huawei,Y6p,where are getting the apps you can get aplications from huawei appgallery and moreapps thats you find on huawei appgallery
Huawei,Y6p,this phones camera is at an average quality at this price point you can go for redmi note more dude its for low baget the specs are good for poor like medont say stupid thing just because your richkidwe are not like uif your just busher jus scramwe dont need dam bashers here
Huawei,Y6p,am use huawei since years this phone good without gmail google youtube in huawei store you can install more awesome apps
Huawei,Y6p,used many huawei devices and my current phone is from huawei so believe when tell you that this is garbage product youll eventually regret buying if you have no problem with the lack of gms add few dollars and get the yp the difference is huge and worth more than what youll pay in addition
Huawei,Y6p,very handicap without gms youtube can view in browser but cannot cast to tv cannot use voice more want to ask messnger dont work in this device
Huawei,Y6p,its volte support calling
Huawei,Y6p,maybe just yours coz mine is working great even without the google play store where are getting the apps
Huawei,Y6p,does this work for games it will run some games but this is not made for gaming if you need gaming mobile phone would go for series
Huawei,Y6p,agree not happy without google playstore why most of the time the games are not opening on more maybe just yours coz mine is working great even without the google play store
Huawei,Y6p,nah think its not became inconvenient to me without the google playstore some apps use more agree not happy without google playstore why most of the time the games are not opening on this phone is it just my unit
Huawei,Y6p,yes you can just dl apk app worked fine on my yp what is your apk
Huawei,Y6p,know that we cant install google services on any huawei phone right now but can install more yes you can just dl apk app worked fine on my yp
Huawei,Y6p,blue pls
Huawei,Y6p,for someone like me who only want to get taste of huawei mobile services without breaking the bank this is definitely the best option yp may have huaweis own chipset and large quad bayer main camera but its still running android with smaller battery capacity and no usb otg
Huawei,Y6p,only euros for the gb version in the philippinesfor reason no google services and more can install apps such as messenger facebookwatsapp viber etc without any problem its even easier if do it via phone clone then dont need to install the apps again there is rd party app called apkpure were can get downloads and install apps
Huawei,Y6p,just get realme it is the entry level king alongside the xiaomi redmi note
Huawei,Y6p,uhmmm mediatek no
Huawei,Y6p,my personal take of huawei batteries are not good have prime purchased in and nova purchased in their batteries are already bloated though admit do overnight charging of the units but my other unit samsung galaxy purchased in doing the same charging but battery is still okay until now
Huawei,Y6p,their most recent phones no longer have google playstore and google play services one of the more not all games because some games have alternatives other than google play for example you can still play supercell games with supercell id and ml through moonton account or fb
Huawei,Y6p,yeah why they using the helio and they dont support google service who will ever more please keep in mind that us banned huawei so huawei stop using google services
Huawei,Y6p,the powervr gpu is pretty decent for lowend gaming at low settings
Huawei,Y6p,not it have unisoc sca hm maybe gsmarena is wrong about that then they list it as on the but kimovil does say its that unisoc soc but then there are also other sources saying its got the and some saying the idk what to trust either way still stand by what said about how it should have snapdragon
Huawei,Y6p,nah bare minimum wouldve been even the euro zte blade has the this is inex more not it have unisoc sca
Huawei,Y6p,helio with this price funny at least needed nah bare minimum wouldve been even the euro zte blade has the this is inexcusable it should have the snapdragon
Huawei,Y6p,why not using one of these helio

Huawei,Y6s (2019),is it contain screen recorder
Huawei,Y6s (2019),the camera and battery are somehow disappointing its rebound of honor pro its avril technology
Huawei,Y6s (2019),camera in is this not funny joke its not how many cameras that produce good photos its what sensor is being used and the software that processes those images but yeah the least they could do was add another cam for depth sensing and the battery on this is just waayy
Huawei,Y6s (2019),no for its price its terrible even if it were you mean xiaomeme like the pricing of xiaomi phones but goddamn the quality is trashy afterall doesnt worth buck if you can just use it for years mi is trash btw id rather pick redmi note rather than atrashy series
Huawei,Y6s (2019),listen give your lessons for yourself and my attitude is not your matter you need to conduct researchs xd didnt know what is the different between standard usb type and micro usb that can handle va
Huawei,Y6s (2019),maybe you charging circuits of the phone can be different depending on the manafacuter des more listen give your lessons for yourself and my attitude is not your matter
Huawei,Y6s (2019),for its price point starts at you cant actually complain to the specs like bro do yo more no for its price its terrible even if it were
Huawei,Y6s (2019),this one looks like toy add only dollars more and you get the much better oppo still very cheap at dollars version gbgb
Huawei,Y6s (2019),you have no commun sense at all ther is difference between usb and usb type maybe you charging circuits of the phone can be different depending on the manafacuter design so basically can put usb and usb no fast charge support on both on the test and will just get the same result you need to do some researchs about how these works not all usb support fast charge and you need attitude adjustments
Huawei,Y6s (2019),good phone as its old brother but it misses usb type and gorilla glass even and decent more for its price point starts at you cant actually complain to the specs like bro do you even have any common sense at all for me micro usb and usb typec doesnt have that much differences because not all usb typec can perform fast charge while some micro usb phones can like oppo as that can use up to watts overall specs wise its pretty good and its one of the top tier phones that you can get for its price less complains
Huawei,Y6s (2019),unable to install nbak

Huawei,Y7p,he hava received android for huawei yp as result of emui update
Huawei,Y7p,minutes ago received notification about the android release of the device
Huawei,Y7p,in paper if it support the ca support that doesnt always means it support every carrier som more thanks for all informations know all most about carrier aggregation my carrier support interband intraband on some bands see all ca combinations support by kirin like honor we have here lot of combinations support by carriers no one of theme work on this device phone companies not giving this advanced infos for buyers will never buy any phone not support ca im stuck right now on band mhz and band mhz there is two another bands mhz mhz
Huawei,Y7p,maybe need ota update to support carriers ca combinations to every country because we have more dont think so many devices are like that for example xiaomi redmi they are cat on paper but regular in reality outside china ota didnt have effect
Huawei,Y7p,methods banned by google and will ban by google really
Huawei,Y7p,the hauwei yp is great badget phoneas photographer the megapixel is nice and detailed but poor colors slow mo videos has bad quality battery life is okay the screen is okay but would have like fhd resolution screen but its all about what you think about the device if you are okay with living without gms go for itits like you buy for what you get and it clearly says that its great badgetbut for now lll buy the huawei pro plus
Huawei,Y7p,its not support in iran tehran almost all areas of tehran has coverage but yp is more maybe need ota update to support carriers ca combinations to every country because we have some combinations bands here not working maybe ca is this need another settings from carrier to add the new phone to carrier aggregation or the service is universal
Huawei,Y7p,chinese phones are like that because china network bands are different than eu west asia more are sure this phone not support carrier aggregation will sell this trash if not support
Huawei,Y7p,why this specs shows carrier aggregation ca and cpu support it chinese phones are like that because china network bands are different than eu west asia afr bands
Huawei,Y7p,no its just regular why this specs shows carrier aggregation ca and cpu support it
Huawei,Y7p,for me this is the best phone for this price installed all the google apps they are work more which method link all methods banned by google
Huawei,Y7p,hi im going to buy huawei pls advise me is this good phone for me this is the best phone for this price installed all the google apps they are working without any error use latest youtube videos to know the method of installing google services
Huawei,Y7p,google apps play store youtube maps gmail can be installed manually working without any error follow youtube for latest methods old methods are not working very good phone for this price speed is greatbeautiful design
Huawei,Y7p,worst you cant sign in to any google apps theyre useless this phone is terrible am also having everything is working fine
Huawei,Y7p,now with more apps ap from huawei app gallery you have all the google apps maps messenger more cant download messenger says not available in this region
Huawei,Y7p,huawei should just stop launching phones untill they build their own software aphone without more now with more apps ap from huawei app gallery you have all the google apps maps messenger skype chrome shazam ect
Huawei,Y7p,alirezairan jun not at all my opinions changed completely after week of usage seeing problems more more huawei should just stop launching phones untill they build their own software aphone without google maps is awaste
Huawei,Y8p,having this phone for about years for the price paid really got smooth experience mine is not whatsapping what should do
Huawei,Y8p,using yearsvery smooth and no lag
Huawei,Y8p,one is available here want to bay huaweiyp have this time
Huawei,Y8p,in need of to buy how do get one or lit one is available here
Huawei,Y8p,guys cool little thing just found out yp supports usbc headphones you can also convert your older headphones by using an adapter doing that might make the sound little sweeter to ears
Huawei,Y8p,after waiting for long time finally converted my phone from aqmlx to aqmal and updated more looks like you have done job there also keep us posted on how your experience has been with harmony os do you recommend others do the conversion
Huawei,Y8p,guess no native gms then no those dont run natively but am glad that with gbox atleast can now use full version of apps that synch too
Huawei,Y8p,have good news theres new app called gbox that solves all your problems it runs more guess no native gms then
Huawei,Y8p,its available in my neck of the woods for an amount equal to
Huawei,Y8p,guys if you are planning to get this phone now want to report that the camera is the phones weak point theres no stabilization of any sort and therefore the videos are of very low quality the videos taken have some weird focus hunting issue and appear blurry the photos look good during the day but at night even the night mode produces unacceptable photos you need tripod to get good photos at night on tripod you can be creative with pro mode and night filters now some pros the phone is thin and light with nice design the audio from earphones and blue tooth speakers is sweet the phone never lags never crashes wifi range is good no fast charging but that doesnt bother me battery lasts all day for me no heavy gaming but light gaming like subway surfers is fine screen is oled but brightness could have been higher but its still good for the price if the price is good the phone can be an option for huawei customers hope this helps cheers
Huawei,Y8p,best phone so far close to yrs and no problem how do you install google services natively on it
Huawei,Y8p,lost my old iphone and had to use this thing for few months worst days of my life no google services across all apps this useless emui from huawei that you cant switch off
Huawei,Y8p,buy iphone pro max how much is it does it hung or has any issues
Huawei,Y8p,what phone doesnt heat up you just gotta deal with it buy iphone pro max
Huawei,Y8p,anyone have problems with eyesight used it for year now its really good phone but feel more think you should get your eyes checked too have experienced the same thought twas because of my phone screen but it wasnt turned out that have bad astigmatism and eye grade
Huawei,Y8p,pls want to switch from this phone to nova bcos am experiencing some lags when playing gamesi game lot is it good choice
Huawei,Y8p,great for budget oriented phone it has some decent specs and even though it doesnt have the google services or playstore you can still used them however that is by using third party apps for instances using gspace googlefier or any other app that does similar bypassing method does the trick though the only downside for this is that it has low battery capacity and you wont be able to use any micro sd card storages it only supports nano sim so youll be needing nano sd card for you to add your external storage

Huawei,Y8p,pros very slick well built phone light not bulky cheap with these features in screen finger print scanner amoled screen thats beautiful fast enough for most games lag free no google sevices huge amount of ram and space great battery life very good value phone cons no google services seems fairly difficult to install without root most work arounds dont work that have tried but to be honest dont really need it playstore you can use aurora store which is also much nicer vmos if you need google maps youtube or gmail theres alternatives to all google apps that are often better some google apps like google fa still work

Huawei,Y8p,no google apk and camara but picture look like mp and most important google map not working properly
Huawei,Y8p,nova se no oled yp with oled are you kidding me huawei was going to get nova se but drop the idea when know it equiped with ips
Huawei,Y8p,please release your models with good difference in technology and cost and sell your over produced panels to new lower grade companies to keep your name good in market am have example like motor companies started front wheel driving technologies from but till some companies use the same frame which one have big mountain between two rear seats in foundation like two passengers in rear seat can place there feet easily on there sides but the middle one have to put his one foot in right side of that mountain and other foot in left side that mountain was used for shaft which was connected from engine to rear wheels dont understand why these companies are producing same material for long time even they know the world getting changes very fast no one is asking for that policy feel that same things are doing mobile phones companies now they produce much more main board sub board and processor and they should have sell it in market even through the new companies or with there own name what is use of planning and sales management if you have play with your customers its not good for companies they will lose there name and worth dont do like nokia they expect smart phones technology after big loos huawei and samsung should have to take care of their names listen that iphone also going to release many models in coming time so the iphone will be the same
Huawei,Y8p,how many kirin chips you have made yes hahahaha
Huawei,Y8p,kirin for bucks funny
Huawei,Y8p,dude is huawei nova worth buying the phone is of very good value outstanding battery and very good camera if you dont care about google services that much and you are willing to try something new then go for it its currently my daily phone even believe that the score given by gsmarena for that phone is undervalued
Huawei,Y8p,vahidk may dear friend kirin series cant take google licences for third party main os app attenti more dear friend what are you saying that kirin is old years old as if you need to change your phone every months but kirin is great use honor years and from android and now works perfectly without any problems and is still faster than snapdragon on xiaomi redmi note which is year newer
Huawei,Y8p,add oled too but even oled doesnt make me happy want yp just with change accept more dear friend kirin series cant take google licences for third party main os app attention all kirin is same and very week for oled refresh rate also huawei begin use mediatek chip in this company product and during the time will be increase its awful when huawei release first kirin chip said we never use of chip and week chip for our product and it reason only for restricted and fight technology or contrary to the direction of water mediatek can easily google licences only im so sorry for this company waiting for new product with old high end chip of this company also they take licences before but all of them like is old wirh new face
Huawei,Y8p,so this creepy lower midranger phone gets an oled screen while higher phones get lcds for sh more think you are confusing technology with quality the ips lcd screens used on huaweis midrangers are of excellent quality and may surpass the quality of many oled panels on the market im curently using both huawei and samsung midrangers and honestly cant say which is better the ips on the huawei or the amoled on the samsung its marketing decision by the end of the day dont expect this oled on thr yp to be comparable to the one on the pp pro its different league some users actually still prefer lcd over oled
Huawei,Y8p,honor play pro with kirin renamed to yp but dont know when huawei will put aside kirin just like kirin httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephpidphoneidphone
Huawei,Y8p,was looking to find whats difference btw yp vs yp httpsmgsmarenacomcomparephp more add oled too but even oled doesnt make me happy want yp just with change accept it even with being hd screen just with kirin not kirin af
